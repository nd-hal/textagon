hundreds|_|01 of people|_|01 marched|_|04 through the city|_|03 , disrupting|_|01 traffic|_|03 and spray|_|06 - painting|_|04 graffiti|_|01 . authorities|_|01 reported|_|05 instances|_|01 of vandalism|_|01 and assault|_|03 during a rally|_|01 that organizers|_|02 had billed|_|02 as peaceful|_|01 earlier|_|01 in the day|_|07 . in other parts|_|09 of the country|_|04 , spirited|_|02 demonstrations|_|03 on college|_|02 campuses|_|01 and peaceful|_|01 marches|_|04 along|_|01 downtown|_|01 streets|_|05 have taken|_|35 place|_|01 since wednesday|_|01 . – – advertisement|_|01 – – a mainly|_|01 peaceful|_|01 protest|_|02 by about 3,000 people|_|01 ended|_|02 in los angeles|_|02 early|_|01 saturday|_|01 with about 200|_|01 arrests|_|02 for failure|_|07 to disperse|_|04 after police|_|01 broke|_|28 up the lingering|_|01 demonstration|_|03 . hundreds|_|01 joined|_|02 a friday|_|01 afternoon|_|01 “ love|_|01 rally|_|02 ” in washington|_|05 square|_|01 park|_|01 in manhattan|_|01 .
i really|_|01 like|_|02 kate and she is an amazing|_|01 actress|_|01 . it sucks|_|03 that she and her husband|_|01 after so many|_|01 years|_|03 have decided|_|03 to call|_|03 it quits|_|01 . america|_|01 has one|_|06 of the highest|_|02 divorce|_|01 rates|_|02 in the world|_|08 , which makes|_|42 me feel|_|05 that love|_|04 is harder|_|10 to attain|_|01 today|_|01 . although i am a hopeless|_|04 romantic|_|01 and i feel|_|05 that not every|_|02 coupling|_|01 has to be condemned|_|01 to such a fate|_|04 as kate , len and most americans|_|01 have to endure|_|06 .
was|_|02 this really|_|01 noe - nazi|_|02 duckboards|_|01 ? or was this a left|_|01 - wing|_|01 attempt|_|01 to incite|_|02 minorities|_|03 and drive|_|01 them to the polls|_|05 ? why are we not past|_|02 this crap|_|01 ? ridiculous|_|02 . i love|_|01 a lot|_|07 of things|_|12 about being southern|_|03 , but this crap|_|01 drives|_|01 me nuts|_|01 . who does this ? can we bring|_|01 back|_|04 the stockade|_|01 ? tar|_|06 and feather|_|03 ?
thank|_|01 goodness|_|03 for presentiment|_|01 hopefully|_|02 this means|_|04 an end|_|01 to dacha|_|01 and hopefully|_|02 immigration|_|02 reform|_|01 in the near|_|01 future|_|01 ! these people|_|03 have broken|_|28 the law|_|02 and are here illegally|_|01 yet|_|01 they expect|_|01 to be treated|_|05 just like|_|02 us|_|01 citizens|_|01 . dacha|_|01 is a slap|_|06 in the face|_|04 to those immigrants|_|01 who followed|_|19 the law|_|02 and went|_|01 through the process|_|03 to become|_|01 legal|_|04 citizens|_|01 . liberals|_|01 are not adjusting|_|01 very well|_|03 to the defeat|_|01 of hillary|_|01 - they are still|_|01 crying|_|02 .
gun|_|01 control|_|02 should be a priority|_|01 in our country|_|04 . after reading|_|06 about children|_|04 who lost|_|03 their lives|_|01 due|_|02 to gun|_|01 violence|_|03 , it 's hard|_|01 to argue|_|03 that it 's way|_|11 to easy|_|03 to get|_|02 your hands|_|01 on a gun|_|01 . americans|_|03 are much|_|01 like|_|02 people|_|01 all over the world|_|01 , but we have infinitely|_|02 more gun|_|01 deaths|_|05 , and it 's all because of the ease|_|02 of acquiring|_|01 those guns|_|01 .
women|_|02 in iceland|_|02 protested|_|03 the pay|_|01 gap|_|01 between men|_|01 and women|_|02 by arguing|_|03 that a woman|_|02 's salary|_|01 is 30|_|01 % less|_|01 than the salary|_|01 of a man|_|01 in similar|_|04 work|_|05 positions|_|01 , the women|_|02 of iceland|_|02 decreased|_|02 their working|_|27 day|_|10 30|_|01 % of the time|_|04 daily|_|01 work|_|05 and went|_|01 out to protest|_|03 united|_|01 to a square|_|07 . this was supported|_|04 by the majority|_|01 of the community|_|01 .
this is an old|_|07 article|_|04 , that made|_|35 the paris|_|04 accords|_|01 seem|_|02 so responsible|_|02 and dutiful|_|01 , until trump|_|02 revealed|_|02 that it was a crap|_|01 deal|_|07 that took|_|29 advantage|_|03 of the us|_|01 , obligating|_|02 them to pay|_|10 way|_|05 more than other countries|_|04 . plus|_|02 the soonest|_|01 results|_|03 of this regulation|_|01 will not occur|_|01 for a century|_|01 , and will be just a blip|_|02 of difference|_|04 . it 's a scam|_|01 .
lao|_|02 why has no one|_|02 told|_|07 me about this . this i\should be like|_|02 public|_|02 information|_|05 from insurance|_|01 companies|_|01 but of course|_|07 they are trying|_|06 the most amount|_|01 of money|_|01 off of their customers|_|01 . us|_|01 safe|_|01 drivers|_|05 are the reason|_|06 why they are profitable|_|01 in the first|_|06 place|_|01 , so they could do their part|_|09 and give|_|04 us|_|01 discounts|_|01 for our safe|_|01 driving|_|06 practices|_|05
i do n't understand|_|02 why there is so much|_|01 hate|_|01 . it 's like|_|02 every|_|01 one|_|06 lives|_|03 in their own little|_|01 bubble|_|03 seeing|_|02 everything foreign|_|02 to them as a threat|_|02 . they take|_|02 up selfish|_|01 ideology|_|01 because they do n't like|_|02 something , instead|_|01 of just disassociating|_|01 with it . this greatly|_|01 saddens|_|02 me , for i have seen|_|02 the world|_|08 in all it 's wonder|_|01 . where the majority|_|01 of people|_|01 just want|_|05 to live|_|07 in peace|_|02 , without boundaries|_|01 . yet|_|01 this idea|_|03 of cultural|_|02 heritage|_|04 has become|_|04 disastrous|_|06 further dividing|_|02 people|_|01 . if only more people|_|01 could set|_|02 aside|_|06 their petty|_|03 ideals|_|01 , and just accept|_|02 each other as other humans|_|02 . instead|_|01 we classify|_|01 and further separate|_|01 ourselves due|_|02 to every|_|01 difference|_|01 . i would prefer|_|01 to just die|_|03 , than put|_|07 up with such cruel|_|01 disgusting|_|02 people|_|01 . i am disgusted|_|02 with my country|_|02 of americans|_|03 . we deserve|_|01 to burn|_|01 ....
hey b|_|02 , remember|_|07 that conversation|_|01 we had the other day|_|01 , well|_|09 i found|_|02 an article|_|02 that talks|_|05 about it . it basically|_|01 says|_|09 that humans|_|02 have destroyed|_|04 10|_|01 percent|_|01 of earth|_|04 's wilderness|_|03 in the last|_|02 25|_|01 years|_|03 . the article|_|02 said|_|09 that the total|_|01 land|_|10 area|_|01 is about half|_|01 the size|_|05 of the amazon|_|03 and twice|_|01 the size|_|05 of the whole|_|01 state|_|01 of alaska|_|01 . that is about 1.3 million|_|01 square|_|02 miles|_|02 of wilderness|_|03 , that just disappeared|_|06 . the article|_|02 also|_|02 revealed|_|02 that humanity|_|08 has one|_|01 to two|_|01 decades|_|01 more to turn|_|20 it around|_|09 before it is too late|_|04 . i hope|_|02 something is done soon|_|01 and i 'll send|_|02 you a link|_|09 to the article|_|02 .
hi|_|01 . just read|_|06 an article|_|02 about how russia|_|01 is moving|_|01 some of their military|_|03 ships|_|01 near|_|07 to britain|_|01 . what 's the deal|_|06 there ? i can really|_|01 figure|_|01 out what the russian|_|01 government|_|02 is up to . the article|_|02 says|_|01 they are stating|_|01 the want|_|01 to keep|_|01 major|_|04 waterways|_|01 safe|_|02 , but i did n't know|_|05 there was a problem|_|01 . maybe|_|01 they 're creating|_|03 one|_|01 .
venezuela|_|01 and many|_|01 of it 's sister|_|03 countries|_|04 are going|_|15 through a crisis|_|02 . due|_|02 to drops|_|03 in oil|_|01 prices|_|05 , and the loss|_|02 of income|_|01 the country|_|04 has received|_|03 from this drop|_|03 , the citizens|_|01 are the ones|_|01 that are paying|_|01 for it . they are hungry|_|01 , there is issues|_|06 with people|_|01 not having enough|_|02 food|_|03 and starving|_|02 . their political|_|02 powers|_|01 are corrupt|_|02 and ca|_|01 n't be counted|_|08 on for help|_|02 . there is fighting|_|02 , rebels|_|01 and rampant|_|03 crime|_|02 . my heart|_|03 breaks|_|02 for this people|_|01 , as they do n't have anyone to turn|_|01 to for help|_|02 . they feel|_|04 powerless|_|01 , hungry|_|01 and scared|_|10 .
kiss|_|04 is a real|_|08 tragedy|_|02 . many|_|01 people|_|01 are dead|_|17 , and more people|_|01 are severely|_|04 injured|_|01 . the drilling|_|01 is likely|_|01 what caused|_|02 it , and the developer|_|01 should be held|_|04 responsible|_|02 . he has caused|_|02 much|_|05 pain|_|02 and suffering|_|01 . kenyans|_|01 deserve|_|01 better|_|13 , and since he did n't listen|_|02 to ca|_|01 warnings|_|04 , he should pay|_|10 for what he did . the other buildings|_|07 in the area|_|01 should be thoroughly|_|02 tested|_|07 to see|_|01 if anything can be done to prevent|_|02 this .
i think|_|13 it is our responsibility|_|02 as a first|_|02 world|_|03 country|_|04 to be providing|_|01 assistance|_|02 to these area|_|01 in brazil|_|01 and columbia|_|01 . erika virus|_|03 could prove|_|01 to be an epidemic|_|01 and that is a global|_|01 issue|_|02 , not just a country|_|04 . giving|_|01 them access|_|04 to proper|_|03 medical|_|01 training|_|05 to spread|_|07 better|_|18 health|_|02 practices|_|01 and health|_|02 education|_|05 to the population|_|04 could be the most effective|_|04 thing|_|08 to preventing|_|02 more spread|_|10 of the virus|_|03
i feel|_|05 like|_|02 the shipwreck|_|03 among st other violence|_|01 that occurred|_|01 in this article|_|04 is pretty|_|02 sad|_|02 . like|_|02 other articles|_|04 that i have read|_|06 , it seems|_|02 like|_|02 there is just so much|_|01 death|_|05 occurring|_|01 and there is not too much|_|01 coverage|_|01 over it . the amount|_|02 that we do see|_|05 do n't seem|_|02 to even|_|04 scratch|_|07 the surface|_|04 as there are many|_|01 other acts|_|02 of violence|_|01 and events|_|01 that occur|_|01 that take|_|06 the lives|_|03 of many|_|01 other people|_|01 from places|_|01 like|_|02 third|_|01 world|_|08 countries|_|04 that do n't even|_|04 get|_|02 broadcaster|_|02 at all . sad|_|02 to see|_|05 that our world|_|08 is slowly|_|01 spiraling|_|01 into this chaos|_|04 that just continues|_|02 to grow|_|01 .
the spread|_|01 of cholera|_|01 is very widespread|_|01 in haiti|_|01 . it is costing|_|02 tons|_|01 of lives|_|13 , and money|_|03 food|_|03 and doctors|_|03 are very much|_|01 needed|_|01 . its hard|_|10 to control|_|05 like|_|02 any other high|_|02 spreading|_|02 disease|_|01 . doctors|_|03 need|_|01 resources|_|01 so much|_|01 that they ca|_|01 nt|_|01 keep|_|04 up with ever|_|01 growing|_|08 number|_|04 of patients|_|01 . they need|_|01 food|_|03 , medical|_|02 supplies|_|02 , and other miscellaneous|_|02 equipment|_|01 that would help|_|05 them improve|_|02 their job|_|01 and combating|_|01 the outbreak|_|01 .
i feel|_|04 like|_|02 this is a very opinionated|_|01 article|_|04 . in not sure|_|02 who wrote|_|02 this article|_|04 but i truly|_|01 feel|_|04 like|_|02 they have a lot|_|05 of raw|_|06 mixed|_|01 up emotional|_|03 feelings|_|02 that they ca|_|01 nt|_|01 get|_|03 out . although , we are all very aware|_|01 of the constant|_|02 changes|_|06 going|_|02 on int he world|_|08 with equality|_|02 and everyone going|_|02 through the issues|_|01 of being unjust|_|01 and such .. its a lot|_|05 to handle|_|02 and a lot|_|05 of people|_|01 just font|_|01 know|_|01 what to do . i feel|_|04 lad|_|02 for the people|_|01 in the story|_|01
" i would give|_|01 these people|_|01 a life|_|01 sentence|_|01 in prison|_|02 . people|_|01 who steal|_|02 from the less|_|03 fortunate|_|02 and exploit|_|02 resources|_|03 and innocents|_|01 have no place|_|01 in our society|_|02 ! they stole|_|02 from pensioners|_|01 and investors|_|01 and blew|_|18 millions|_|02 on luxuries|_|03 and other forms|_|01 of pleasurable|_|01 experiences|_|02 at the expense|_|03 of people|_|01 , causing|_|01 suffering|_|03 and pain|_|04 ! they should be punished|_|01 accordingly|_|01 , a dark|_|01 cell|_|02 with a toilet|_|04 and a meal|_|03 of prison|_|02 mush|_|02 twice|_|01 a day|_|05 would serve|_|01 them just right|_|01 . it 's a typical|_|03 story|_|02 about wealthy|_|01 and elite|_|01 out there , who always|_|02 harm|_|01 the innocents|_|01 and somehow|_|02 able|_|04 to get|_|08 away|_|09 and proven|_|01 " " innocent|_|03 " " . i would especially|_|01 show|_|02 no mercy|_|05 when it comes|_|04 to these greedy|_|03 bankers|_|02 all over the world|_|08 . there is absolutely|_|01 no excuse|_|01 for their crimes|_|02 - so much|_|01 poverty|_|01 and grief|_|01 all over the world|_|08 ! "
it 's a shame|_|02 that air|_|08 pollution|_|01 has potentially|_|01 been linked|_|02 to increased|_|02 mental|_|05 damage|_|02 with young|_|01 children|_|01 . we often|_|05 do n't take|_|02 into account|_|05 all the damage|_|02 that the fossil|_|02 fuel|_|01 companies|_|03 have done to our society|_|03 . we only praise|_|01 them for creating|_|02 the fuels|_|01 we use|_|01 but never|_|02 tax|_|01 them appropriately|_|01 for all the damage|_|02 that they cause|_|02 us|_|01 .
so apparently|_|01 russia|_|01 sent|_|02 a bunch|_|02 of bombs|_|05 on a school|_|07 in syria|_|01 . it killed|_|01 like|_|02 22|_|01 kids|_|02 . now the russian|_|01 government|_|01 is trying|_|01 to say|_|11 it never|_|02 happened|_|01 . they even|_|03 showed|_|10 satellite|_|01 images|_|08 of another|_|01 place|_|01 and claimed|_|02 it was there . some organization|_|02 called|_|01 hew|_|02 ( human|_|02 rights|_|01 watch|_|04 ) had evidence|_|03 to show|_|10 otherwise|_|01 . they even|_|03 had images|_|08 of the same type|_|03 of aircraft|_|01 that the russians|_|02 use|_|07 .
this is totally|_|01 unsurprising|_|01 for the use|_|07 . the laws|_|01 are usually|_|01 lenient|_|03 in these extreme|_|04 cases|_|05 though|_|01 , which makes|_|36 this occurrence|_|01 a strange|_|02 one|_|06 . there is some ulterior|_|02 political|_|03 motive|_|01 at work|_|01 here . this woman|_|02 's misfortune|_|02 is being used|_|01 to advance|_|02 some goal|_|03 most likely|_|01 . i wonder|_|03 what they 're up to . what do you think|_|03 ?
it saddens|_|02 and scares|_|01 me that people|_|01 do n't see|_|01 terrorists|_|01 for what they are : radicalized|_|01 individuals|_|01 who have gone|_|03 rogue|_|01 . the vast|_|01 majority|_|03 of muslims|_|01 are peaceful|_|01 people|_|01 who just want|_|05 to live|_|07 their lives|_|03 and practice|_|05 their faith|_|02 . this country|_|02 needs|_|02 to be educated|_|01 on other cultures|_|06 so we stop|_|01 fearing|_|03 the unknown|_|02 . building|_|01 more walls|_|02 and dividers|_|02 between different|_|03 groups|_|01 of people|_|01 wo n't help|_|01 anything .
dear|_|04 friend|_|01 , how are you ? i heard|_|02 that you fell|_|08 down the stairs|_|04 and broke|_|22 your leg|_|04 ! ! are you ok|_|01 ? hope|_|06 you are getting|_|01 better|_|01 . but seriously|_|01 , what really|_|01 happened|_|04 ? your mum|_|03 told|_|03 me that you were running|_|14 and fell|_|08 but i want|_|01 to hear|_|02 directly|_|04 from you . i am coming|_|04 to the hospital|_|02 to visit|_|04 you in an hour|_|02 . that 's my final|_|03 decision|_|01 . no one|_|02 can change|_|02 it , and yes|_|01 because you did n't come|_|04 to school|_|05 today|_|02 you missed|_|01 a lot|_|04 of work|_|01 . do n't be too happy|_|04 , you 'll have to complete|_|01 the work|_|01 later|_|01
this does not surprise|_|01 me . the people|_|01 on horny|_|01 are kind|_|01 of trashy|_|01 . so , it is not hard|_|11 to believe|_|01 they were married|_|02 to a person|_|01 who would do something like|_|02 this . it does not really|_|01 sound|_|02 like|_|02 a big|_|04 deal|_|06 either|_|01 . he could have done much|_|01 worse|_|01 . did she even|_|03 lose|_|07 money|_|03 because of this ? i would guess|_|02 not .
it is disturbing|_|11 to me that people|_|01 in the us|_|01 are not starting|_|10 as many|_|01 small|_|01 businesses|_|01 and the number|_|08 of entrepreneurs|_|01 is falling|_|14 . i think|_|03 it 's because of all the government|_|02 regulations|_|05 and red|_|01 tape|_|02 that makes|_|08 it difficult|_|02 for a small|_|01 business|_|01 to start|_|10 up and compete|_|01 . it 's also|_|02 of concern|_|01 that us|_|01 workers|_|03 are stressed|_|07 about job|_|01 security|_|06 .
i feel|_|13 very sad|_|01 for the family|_|08 of people|_|03 who have lost|_|01 their loved|_|02 ones|_|02 , especially|_|01 family|_|08 members|_|01 that were so very deeply|_|01 involved|_|02 with the community|_|01 and have touched|_|02 so many|_|01 hearts|_|01 of the people|_|03 around|_|04 them as well|_|08 . i am sure|_|02 that for a long|_|01 time|_|03 , memories|_|01 and special|_|04 moments|_|02 will be told|_|07 with heart|_|01 felt|_|03 warmth|_|01 for many|_|01 generations|_|01 .
hello|_|01 there . so i just read|_|06 this disturbing|_|11 story|_|03 about a teacher|_|02 who is involved|_|01 in child|_|04 pornography|_|01 . he is now going|_|01 to face|_|01 courts|_|01 for such a disgusting|_|02 habit|_|01 . i think|_|10 this teacher|_|02 should really|_|01 be punished|_|01 exemplary|_|01 so that even|_|04 those who were thinking|_|10 of doing it can take|_|39 notice|_|06 . this is totally|_|01 unacceptable|_|04 in our education|_|05 system|_|02
other story|_|03 similar|_|01 to the local|_|01 news|_|02 about the killing|_|02 of a woman|_|02 i know|_|10 in town|_|01 . it always|_|02 makes|_|35 me think|_|01 of the children|_|03 first|_|01 . it also|_|02 makes|_|35 me wonder|_|02 how a person|_|01 could commit|_|18 such atrocities|_|02 , especially|_|01 in front|_|01 of children|_|03 . the child|_|03 that called|_|01 911 will no doubt|_|02 mentally|_|01 live|_|08 with that phone|_|01 call|_|01 for the rest|_|05 of their life|_|01 . article|_|02 seem|_|03 to have been murder|_|01 , and a middle|_|04 class|_|03 home|_|01 , maybe|_|01 drug|_|01 use|_|01 or robbery|_|01 gone|_|01 wrong|_|02 ? what is wrong|_|07 with the world|_|08 today|_|01 ? i will certainly|_|01 hug|_|02 my children|_|03 tighter|_|06 tonight|_|01 after reading|_|05 all these articles|_|02 about murder|_|01 , grieving|_|02 children|_|03 , deaths|_|03 , worldly|_|01 disasters|_|03 and sadness|_|02 . the world|_|08 is such an interesting|_|03 , wonderful|_|02 yet|_|03 sad|_|02 place|_|01 all at once . i will also|_|02 say|_|01 a prayer|_|04 for those kids|_|01 and pray|_|01 and be thankful|_|01 for mine|_|02 .
take|_|15 a look|_|02 at this . it 's very dry|_|07 , and i do n't understand|_|02 half|_|01 the words|_|02 , but while i was reading|_|06 it , i was feeling|_|05 sort|_|01 of glad|_|01 that apparently|_|01 plant|_|03 and animal|_|01 species|_|01 are adapting|_|03 to the warming|_|01 climate|_|01 . it seemed|_|02 like|_|04 the planet|_|01 is warming|_|01 slowly|_|01 enough|_|01 for a lot|_|07 of ecosystems|_|01 to adapt|_|03 . and then i read|_|06 the last|_|07 bit|_|11 , about humans|_|02 and agriculture|_|01 , and got|_|02 cold|_|09 all over again . will we adapt|_|03 , too ? i got|_|02 ta|_|01 say|_|02 , at this point|_|01 , i 'm hoping|_|06 that volcano|_|03 in hawaii|_|02 spews|_|01 a gazillion|_|02 tons|_|01 of ash|_|03 ( after everyone 's been evacuated|_|05 , of course|_|02 ) into the atmosphere|_|01 to block|_|03 the sun|_|01 and cool|_|01 things|_|08 down . it may|_|01 be our best|_|01 shot|_|16 . we could only be so lucky|_|01 .
if we think|_|02 we have it bad|_|01 having to put|_|04 up with trump|_|02 , think|_|02 about how mexico|_|01 feels|_|05 . this article|_|02 puts|_|04 a lot|_|05 in perspective|_|03 , but i really|_|01 struggle|_|06 with the quote|_|01 by the mexican|_|01 foreign|_|01 minister|_|03 saying|_|01 that americans|_|03 chose|_|03 racism|_|01 and hate|_|01 . do n't group|_|03 us|_|01 all in one|_|06 category|_|02 . we did n't all choose|_|03 this clown|_|02 to be president|_|02 . i understand|_|02 their fears|_|03 and stress|_|01 , but that comment|_|01 really|_|01 just rubbed|_|03 me the wrong|_|05 way|_|11 . hopefully|_|02 both countries|_|04 can maintain|_|01 their ties|_|08 until he 's out of office|_|04 .
it deeply|_|01 saddens|_|02 me to think|_|13 that a mother|_|01 could leave|_|02 her child|_|02 on a porch|_|01 and abandon|_|05 it . i feel|_|01 some anger|_|01 towards the mother|_|01 for abandoning|_|05 her young|_|01 , defenseless|_|01 child|_|02 . the child|_|02 is very lucky|_|01 to have been found|_|02 by kind|_|01 strangers|_|02 who were able|_|02 to deliver|_|09 it to safety|_|01 . i hope|_|03 that the child|_|02 will be adopted|_|05 into a loving|_|03 family|_|02 and will be given|_|05 a solid|_|01 upbringing|_|01 .
the trump|_|02 had made|_|16 a huge|_|01 impact|_|02 on a american|_|01 politics|_|05 . he had made|_|16 some terrible|_|02 move|_|05 on the politics|_|05 and it had made|_|16 the other countries|_|04 to turn|_|01 on america.after a white|_|10 supremacist|_|01 carried|_|02 out a massacre|_|03 of black|_|06 churchgoers|_|01 in charleston|_|02 , s.c. , it seemed|_|02 as though|_|01 the confederate|_|01 battle|_|01 flag|_|08 . these were also|_|02 made|_|16 some huge|_|01 impact|_|02 on the american|_|01 politics|_|05 that had made|_|16 by trump|_|02 . but now that explosive|_|03 and complicated|_|01 vestige|_|02 of the old|_|01 south|_|01 is back|_|02 , in a new|_|05 — and , to some americans|_|03 , newly|_|01 disturbing|_|02 context|_|02 . during president|_|02 - elect|_|03 donald j. trump|_|02 ’s campaign|_|01 . when he was still|_|04 running|_|01 for president|_|02 in june|_|01 2015 , trump|_|02 was asked|_|01 whether or not the confederate|_|01 flag|_|08 flying|_|10 above the south|_|01 carolina|_|01 state|_|04 house|_|01 needed|_|01 to be taken|_|05 down . “ i think|_|02 it probably|_|01 does .
this article|_|04 brings|_|11 back|_|02 to mind|_|02 the overall|_|02 mass|_|03 hysteria|_|03 that the left|_|01 , centrists|_|01 , and scone|_|01 feel|_|02 when they think|_|01 about trump|_|02 . i 'm not a trump|_|02 supporter|_|01 , but i honestly|_|01 believe|_|01 people|_|03 are truly|_|01 delusional|_|01 at this point|_|01 . it has become|_|04 vomit|_|01 inducing|_|02 . liberals|_|02 should be more pissed|_|49 at the dc|_|01 for crapping|_|04 on bernie . scone|_|01 should just admit|_|04 to being big|_|12 government|_|02 centrists|_|01 so we can all move|_|01 on .
did you hear|_|02 about that bus|_|01 crash|_|05 that happened|_|01 in delaware|_|02 . it was very sad|_|02 , also|_|02 i read|_|06 that 2|_|01 people|_|03 were injured|_|01 . i hope|_|03 these people|_|03 can recover|_|04 fully|_|01 from their injuries|_|04 and go|_|01 on to lead|_|03 fulfilling|_|01 lives|_|05 . hopefully|_|01 something like|_|02 this will never|_|01 ever|_|03 happen|_|01 again and measures|_|02 are taken|_|09 to prevent|_|02 it .
just wanting|_|01 to let|_|02 you know|_|01 about a news|_|01 story|_|01 i came|_|04 across|_|02 . it is about an elephant|_|02 , named|_|01 noyes|_|01 . he is been owned by a guy|_|03 and held|_|01 in chains|_|04 . he used|_|03 noyes|_|01 to perform|_|03 for public|_|02 entertainment|_|01 in circuses|_|05 and forced|_|01 for most of her life|_|06 to give|_|18 rides|_|02 to adults|_|02 and children|_|03 across|_|02 the united|_|01 states|_|04 . oh|_|01 , and she has been in solitary|_|03 for almost|_|07 30|_|01 years|_|02 , that is a lifetime|_|05 . being captive|_|02 for such a long|_|01 period|_|01 caused|_|02 major|_|08 stress|_|04 to her health|_|01 as well|_|01 as to her psychological|_|01 well|_|05 being . the owner|_|01 has been cited|_|03 numerous|_|01 times|_|03 but in the same time|_|03 his|_|01 license|_|04 was still|_|04 approved|_|02 for renewal|_|01 each year|_|02 . there should be awareness|_|02 for this abuse|_|01 to stop|_|05 .
ugh ! i am literally|_|01 sick|_|02 to my stomach|_|04 about all of these attacks|_|09 . it 's utter|_|01 nonsense|_|01 about how many|_|01 people|_|01 have been killed|_|01 and for what ? ! stupid|_|01 preferences|_|04 on what a someone|_|01 believes|_|01 a society|_|03 should consist|_|02 of ? ! it is disgusting|_|02 . my heart|_|10 really|_|01 goes|_|04 out to all those families|_|04 and the doctors|_|01 ! those doctors|_|01 are tirelessly|_|01 working|_|27 to heal|_|02 as many|_|01 people|_|01 they can and even|_|02 by a dim|_|04 light|_|06 since the conditions|_|06 around|_|04 them are being torn|_|01 to shreds|_|01 . the amount|_|02 of bravery|_|01 to try|_|01 so hard|_|01 and keep|_|02 the number|_|07 of people|_|01 dying|_|01 as low|_|01 as possible|_|01 is amazing|_|01 , to say|_|01 the least|_|01 . i really|_|01 feel|_|05 sad|_|01 for the families|_|04 that have lost|_|06 so many|_|01 loved|_|01 ones|_|01 and that have been displaced|_|02 .
this man|_|02 lived|_|01 here almost|_|07 his|_|01 entire|_|02 life|_|01 . his|_|01 infractions|_|01 in which he was charged|_|02 with are explainable|_|01 . he literally|_|02 was getting|_|02 back|_|04 his|_|01 only true|_|01 property|_|01 from a more than troubled|_|01 house|_|01 . this also|_|02 was a very long|_|01 time|_|06 ago|_|01 . he has since built|_|01 himself up a life|_|01 with a family|_|04 and now they are looking|_|02 to deport|_|02 him . this is a tragedy|_|02 . we must|_|01 do something about this !
hey , i think|_|02 that you should check|_|10 out this article|_|04 . i feel|_|05 bad|_|01 for the citizens|_|01 down in mexico|_|01 city|_|03 and south|_|04 america|_|01 . they are going|_|03 through some troubled|_|01 times|_|04 and america|_|01 is barely|_|01 doing anything to help|_|05 out with their situation|_|01 . those children|_|04 do not deserve|_|01 the life|_|01 they are going|_|03 through at the moment|_|02 and i believe|_|01 that we should do something to make|_|37 them feel|_|05 like|_|02 they are proud|_|01 to be apart|_|02 of their country|_|04 .
wow|_|02 , did you hear|_|02 what happened|_|04 to millikan|_|01 sheratan in france|_|02 ? she was gassed|_|01 and beaten|_|01 and robbed|_|01 . that is unbelievable|_|01 ! so scary|_|01 and it could happen|_|04 to anyone everywhere|_|01 . she is lucky|_|01 to be alive|_|01 . it is sad|_|02 though|_|01 that this story|_|03 got|_|01 mixed|_|02 in with politics|_|05 because it was n't even|_|01 about clinton|_|04 , or obama or trump|_|02 .
this is really|_|01 a moving|_|01 story|_|03 and i could see|_|01 it being motivating|_|01 for a lot|_|02 of women|_|02 . they can realize|_|02 that anyone can be at risk|_|03 for cancer|_|05 . it does n't matter|_|02 whether you are a favor|_|01 actress|_|01 or an ordinary|_|01 person|_|01 . it can be devastating|_|01 to families|_|01 and often|_|03 affects|_|01 them in many|_|01 different|_|03 ways|_|11 . such stories|_|03 should be more accessible|_|04 to give|_|01 people|_|01 hope|_|03 .
hey guys|_|03 as you can see|_|05 here an elderly|_|01 woman|_|01 has come|_|02 up and was taken|_|35 tot|_|01 he hospital|_|02 by the police|_|01 and they are requesting|_|02 assistance|_|02 trying|_|01 to identify|_|02 her and see|_|05 who knows|_|01 her if any of you have seen|_|05 this woman|_|01 or know|_|01 any of her relatives|_|01 or her name|_|03 that would really|_|01 helpful|_|01 in helping|_|01 the police|_|01 get|_|04 her back|_|05 with her family|_|01 and reunite|_|01 with them if you have any tips|_|03 o nay|_|01 sort|_|04 pleas|_|02 one|_|05 forward|_|02 and call|_|05 the police|_|01
sally|_|01 brampton should serve|_|11 as an example|_|04 to others . talk|_|02 about being forgotten|_|04 . she demonstrated|_|02 clear|_|13 signs|_|11 of needing|_|01 help|_|01 , and the system|_|08 failed|_|08 her . what a terrible|_|01 loss|_|03 ! a successful|_|01 , intelligent|_|01 , conflicted|_|06 woman|_|02 who was lost|_|07 way|_|01 too soon|_|01 . it is sad|_|01 to see|_|01 someone|_|01 struggle|_|03 with depression|_|09 and other mental|_|05 illnesses|_|01 . society|_|03 needs|_|01 to do better|_|01 to help|_|05 people|_|01 in need|_|02 , especially|_|01 when they are asking|_|01 for it . it is a shame|_|02 what happened|_|03 to her .
i felt|_|03 that reading|_|06 the excerpt|_|01 from the article|_|04 was sad|_|02 and had me feeling|_|04 distraught|_|01 to an extent|_|02 . i know|_|05 it 's just an article|_|04 but hearing|_|02 about all the bad|_|01 in the world|_|01 is just an assured|_|01 way|_|01 to get|_|07 a poor|_|06 start|_|03 to the day|_|10 . i was mostly|_|01 wondering|_|01 what the situation|_|01 was where richard hon was killed|_|02 in the los angeles|_|02 home|_|07 . hos|_|01 home|_|07 was it and why was george|_|03 stroumbolopoulos there . i 'd like|_|05 to know|_|05 the more intricate|_|01 details|_|04 of what went|_|16 down in this crime|_|02 . was it a murder|_|01 of passion|_|05 or was it cold|_|09 blooded|_|01 . was it in the moment|_|06 or was it calculated|_|01 . what will happen|_|01 now , hopefully|_|02 and investigation|_|01 can uncover|_|02 this .
i personally|_|01 do n't agree|_|01 with science|_|02 making|_|02 these kinds|_|01 of decisions|_|01 . maybe|_|01 , just maybe|_|01 , a higher|_|04 power|_|02 did n't want|_|05 these people|_|03 to reproduce|_|02 ? how do we know|_|01 that these methods|_|01 do n't permanently|_|01 change|_|01 something in the dna|_|01 that helps|_|01 guarantee|_|02 that a serial|_|03 killer|_|01 is born|_|10 four|_|01 of five|_|01 generations|_|02 down the line|_|01 . how do we know|_|01 ? there have been no studies|_|09 . i would guess|_|01 by this article|_|04 that since boys|_|01 that are born|_|10 using|_|01 this method|_|01 also|_|02 have low|_|05 sperm|_|01 counts|_|03 , that something , or someone|_|01 , somewhere|_|01 , is trying|_|01 to tell|_|02 them something .
middle|_|04 east|_|05 is fucked|_|01 up , i 've honestly|_|01 never|_|02 heard|_|02 of a middle|_|04 east|_|01 country|_|04 such as afghanistan|_|01 deporting|_|01 people|_|01 , the mention|_|03 of it just sound|_|02 funny|_|01 , who the heck would want|_|05 to stay|_|05 in that shit|_|01 hole|_|06 country|_|04 that has been infested|_|03 with terrorists|_|01 and child|_|01 rapists|_|01 ? perhaps|_|01 those refugees|_|01 are out of choice|_|02 , honestly|_|01 they should come|_|15 to a better|_|17 country|_|04 such as u.s.|_|01 or u.k , even|_|04 though|_|01 those 2|_|01 countries|_|04 have their own policies|_|03 regarding|_|05 immigration|_|01 , but i think|_|01 they 're quite|_|03 tolerate|_|10 to people|_|01 from war|_|01 torn|_|02 countries|_|04
new|_|05 wildfires|_|01 across|_|02 appalachia|_|01 ! thought|_|03 i 'd share|_|02 this with you after our discussion|_|02 about california|_|01 wild|_|04 fires|_|05 . this one|_|06 is huge|_|01 in the appalachian|_|01 mountains|_|02 and seems|_|04 to be spreading|_|07 . it can also|_|02 be seen|_|01 from space|_|08 ! hopefully|_|02 everyone gets|_|01 out safe|_|02 and the firefighters|_|04 are all able|_|01 to contain|_|02 it safely|_|01 . thinking|_|01 of you !
inst|_|02 it crazy|_|01 man|_|08 that more and more sports|_|04 legends|_|01 are starting|_|06 to pass|_|01 away|_|02 ? him and jack|_|01 were perhaps|_|01 the most important|_|01 icons|_|01 in golf|_|01 . have you ever|_|01 had an arnold|_|02 palmer|_|01 ? it 's a really|_|01 good|_|07 drink|_|01 too . we should share|_|01 a few arnold|_|02 palmer|_|01 later|_|01 on today|_|02 to honor|_|01 the life|_|02 of this great|_|01 man|_|08 . should we hit|_|01 a few rounds|_|09 today|_|02 as well|_|01 ? i mean|_|04 i know|_|01 you 're a big|_|11 gold|_|05 fan|_|01 , so i understand|_|01 how this is upsetting|_|01 you . i will send|_|03 you more articles|_|04 about him later|_|01 on today|_|02 so we can talk|_|01 more about him . what do you think|_|10 ? who do you think|_|10 was better|_|07 ? jack|_|01 or arnold|_|02 ? what about tiger|_|01 ? either|_|01 way|_|01 , i hope|_|02 you get|_|01 this article|_|04 and it helps|_|05 lift|_|25 your spirits|_|01 a bit|_|05 . i can not really|_|01 connect|_|01 to the article|_|04 since i am not a big|_|11 golf|_|01 person|_|01 , but i still|_|01 think|_|10 we should honor|_|01 the man|_|08 .
i just read|_|03 about a tragic|_|01 10|_|01 story|_|03 building|_|01 collapse|_|02 in a town|_|04 called|_|02 kiss|_|04 . i 'm distressed|_|01 about this news|_|02 because they 're still|_|01 searching|_|04 for survivors|_|01 . there 's been a report|_|03 that 9|_|01 are still|_|01 missing|_|01 . i hope|_|03 they 're able|_|03 to find|_|03 these unfortunate|_|01 victims|_|01 . it was horrifying|_|02 reading|_|03 about the accounts|_|03 because people|_|03 could be heard|_|02 screaming|_|02 and shouting|_|02 for help|_|02 . i 'm hopeful|_|01 that they can help|_|03 find|_|03 any remaining|_|03 survivors|_|01 . this is such an unfortunate|_|01 event|_|01 . the cause|_|01 was due|_|03 to bad|_|01 building|_|01 construction|_|01 as the developers|_|02 have cowardly|_|01 gone|_|01 into hiding|_|02 . experts|_|01 said|_|01 a recent|_|01 drilling|_|02 underneath|_|02 the building|_|01 triggered|_|04 the collapse|_|02 . this is horrible|_|03 to hear|_|02 . could you imagine|_|02 if this happened|_|01 to the office|_|01 building|_|01 we worked|_|01 out ? such awful|_|02 and careless|_|03 planning|_|03 resulting|_|03 in lost|_|01 lives|_|01 .
so , i just read|_|03 this article|_|04 about a series|_|01 of bombing|_|02 in new|_|01 york|_|01 and new|_|01 jersey|_|01 and how these acts|_|04 are being viewed|_|05 as an act|_|04 of terrorism|_|01 . sometimes|_|01 i still|_|04 can not believe|_|01 that we lived|_|02 through 9/11|_|01 , especially|_|01 because before that i had never|_|02 even|_|03 heard|_|02 the word|_|01 terrorism|_|01 or knew|_|01 what a terrorist|_|01 attack|_|05 was . and now , we live|_|02 in a world|_|02 where we are constantly|_|02 hearing|_|02 about possible|_|01 terror|_|04 attacks|_|05 or terrorists|_|01 regularly|_|03 on the news|_|04 . it just makes|_|43 me absolutely|_|02 sick|_|01 that this is the world|_|02 i am raising|_|11 my kids|_|01 in and that we have to live|_|02 in fear|_|01 of someone|_|01 trying|_|01 to kill|_|01 us|_|01 or setting|_|01 up bombs|_|05 to surprise|_|02 attack|_|05 people|_|01 . the fact|_|03 that we can not live|_|02 a carefree|_|02 life|_|03 anymore|_|01 because of the sick|_|06 minds|_|01 of individuals|_|01 scares|_|02 me daily|_|01 and makes|_|43 me wish|_|06 i could keep|_|02 my kids|_|01 in a bubble|_|04 ! ! !
this is a sad|_|02 article|_|04 . some many|_|01 things|_|01 are unknown|_|03 for those born|_|01 outside|_|03 the country|_|04 . it is always|_|02 unfair|_|01 that others are able|_|02 to get|_|02 deported|_|01 after spending|_|03 most of their lives|_|01 in the usa|_|01 , especially|_|01 those that came|_|04 at a very early|_|04 age|_|01 . also|_|02 us|_|01 parents|_|01 that adopt|_|03 children|_|02 should be granted|_|05 us|_|01 citizenship|_|02 .
i just read|_|03 this article|_|02 about how canada|_|01 actually|_|02 had school|_|05 where they would force|_|02 indigenous|_|01 people|_|01 of their land|_|04 to go|_|03 . they tried|_|01 to erase|_|01 their history|_|04 , and their language|_|01 . i always|_|02 thought|_|10 canada|_|01 was such a peaceful|_|01 country|_|04 . these people|_|01 were even|_|03 experimented|_|02 on , and the school|_|05 was still|_|01 in operation|_|03 up until 1996 ! , that is astonishing|_|01 . i thought|_|10 , we , americans|_|01 , were the only ones|_|01 who forced|_|02 the indigenous|_|01 people|_|01 away|_|01 , or tried|_|01 to kill|_|01 their culture|_|01 . this just shows|_|10 you that people|_|01 are pretty|_|01 much|_|01 the same , and pretty|_|01 much|_|01 were savages|_|01 , until recently|_|01 . even|_|03 now though|_|01 , we still|_|01 have a long|_|01 way|_|09 to go|_|03 , until we reach|_|02 a place|_|01 where everyone culture|_|01 and differences|_|03 are celebrated|_|06 , and not shamed|_|03 , and destroyed|_|01
it seems|_|04 like|_|02 the premises|_|01 of this argument|_|01 is so shaky|_|02 . just because russia|_|03 and poland|_|01 may|_|01 have had tensions|_|03 for a while , it does not justify|_|01 that they assassinated|_|02 the guy|_|03 . i mean|_|07 , if everyone just assume|_|08 their enemy|_|03 is the result|_|03 of their misfortune|_|02 , they will just be creating|_|05 false|_|02 tension|_|03 with no real|_|03 purpose|_|01 . i understand|_|01 that he is upset|_|02 for their lost|_|07 , and that this was avoidable|_|01 from bad|_|01 weather|_|01 and pilot|_|02 control|_|02 , but still|_|01 .
who knew|_|10 that a typhoon|_|01 hitting|_|01 two|_|01 countries|_|04 would be less|_|03 disturbing|_|11 that articles|_|04 about trees|_|03 and dust|_|03 . our compassion|_|02 is ruled|_|04 by numbers|_|07 and when two|_|01 people|_|01 die|_|05 a storm|_|02 we yawn|_|01 . but show|_|01 us|_|01 dead|_|16 trees|_|03 for tell|_|02 us|_|01 we are breathing|_|05 residue|_|01 for a toilet|_|04 cleaner|_|01 and we freeze|_|05 with panic|_|02 . perspective|_|02 is a hard|_|01 thing|_|08 to find|_|01 sometimes|_|01 .
i have always|_|01 thought|_|10 that politics|_|05 were a scam|_|01 and this is another|_|01 example|_|01 of politics|_|05 gone|_|01 wrong|_|02 . every|_|02 country|_|04 runs|_|34 into problems|_|01 sometimes|_|01 and in this case|_|01 they would like|_|02 her to step|_|08 down from her position|_|01 . do you think|_|10 she really|_|01 has a say|_|01 though|_|01 or will they just force|_|02 her to step|_|08 down if she does not volunteer|_|02 .
did you hear|_|02 about the horrible|_|03 earthquake|_|02 in new|_|08 zeal|_|02 and ? it was devastating|_|01 and i am so heartbroken|_|01 and sad|_|02 for all of those people|_|03 . it 's going|_|01 to be difficult|_|01 to get|_|01 aid|_|02 to some places|_|01 because the roads|_|02 are severely|_|04 damaged|_|02 . those people|_|03 must|_|01 be so terrified|_|01 and worried|_|01 . i 'm sure|_|08 they 're hungry|_|01 and in serious|_|06 need|_|01 of water|_|06 and food|_|01 and many|_|01 are in need|_|01 of shelter|_|04 . i pray|_|01 that god|_|03 gives|_|05 them all peace|_|04 and comfort|_|07 during this time|_|04 .
i think|_|05 protests|_|03 these days|_|01 are getting|_|02 out of hand|_|07 . it 's one|_|05 thing|_|08 if people|_|03 want|_|02 to protest|_|02 peacefully|_|01 , but it 's another|_|01 if they are damaging|_|02 property|_|01 and being aggressive|_|03 and dangerous|_|02 . i believe|_|01 people|_|03 should have a right|_|01 to protest|_|02 , but some laws|_|01 must|_|01 be in place|_|01 . if you ca|_|01 n't follow|_|19 them there will need|_|02 to be consequences|_|01 .
wow|_|01 ! i just read|_|03 this article|_|02 about a young|_|04 boy|_|01 in china|_|01 who fell|_|08 in to a well|_|05 and was found|_|01 dead|_|01 4|_|01 days|_|10 later|_|01 . it was so sad|_|02 to read|_|03 this ! it stated|_|02 that boy|_|01 was helping|_|01 his|_|01 dad|_|01 harvest|_|02 food|_|03 when he fell|_|08 in this well|_|05 that was only 1|_|01 foot|_|11 wide|_|01 and that no adults|_|02 could fit|_|05 in it to go|_|16 down and rescue|_|02 him ! can you even|_|03 imagine|_|02 what that father|_|01 must|_|01 have been feeling|_|04 knowing|_|05 that his|_|01 little|_|03 boy|_|01 fell|_|08 in this well|_|05 while helping|_|01 him and he could not get|_|01 down there to help|_|01 him ! i just imagine|_|02 how heartbreaking|_|02 this whole|_|01 situation|_|02 must|_|01 have been for the family|_|01 and for the rescuers|_|02 who spent|_|03 days|_|10 trying|_|01 everything they could to get|_|01 to him and potentially|_|01 help|_|01 him . as a mom|_|01 , it just makes|_|03 me sick|_|01 to think|_|05 that i could be in a situation|_|02 like|_|02 that and do nothing|_|01 to help|_|01 one|_|01 of my babies|_|02 !

as i read|_|03 this article|_|04 , i felt|_|03 a bit|_|04 nervous|_|01 and alarmed|_|02 at india|_|01 's tiger|_|02 population|_|01 , even|_|03 though|_|01 this is in india|_|01 but still|_|03 . hopefully|_|02 , the tigers|_|02 will be better|_|03 protected|_|02 in the future|_|03 and people|_|01 will stop|_|05 trying|_|01 to kill|_|01 them or dial|_|02 it down at least|_|01 . i wish|_|06 india|_|01 's tigers|_|02 the best|_|03 in their protection|_|01 and survival|_|02 .
you know|_|03 i love|_|01 animals|_|01 , of all kinds|_|01 , so let|_|01 me tell|_|02 you about . this poor|_|06 creature|_|01 was found|_|05 half|_|01 dead|_|16 , mangled|_|01 beyond|_|03 belief|_|01 because of poachers|_|03 . hope|_|02 's story|_|01 really|_|01 brings|_|01 to light|_|01 the horrible|_|03 and illegal|_|01 trade|_|03 of rhino|_|01 poaching|_|01 . i do n't know|_|03 if you know|_|03 , but some people|_|01 value|_|04 rhino|_|01 horns|_|01 more than the beautiful|_|02 creatures|_|01 they come|_|01 from . i do n't believe|_|01 the initial|_|01 attack|_|09 on hope|_|02 was responsible|_|02 for her death|_|01 , but it brought|_|01 this beautiful|_|02 creature|_|01 into the spotlight|_|02 , and i 'm very glad|_|03 for hearing|_|01 of her story|_|01 and saddened|_|02 by her passing|_|02 .
i think|_|01 that everyone should be aware|_|01 of the people|_|01 that they touch|_|02 . there are times|_|02 whenever we take|_|02 others for granted|_|05 . i think|_|01 that we do n't always|_|04 tell|_|02 each other about what their lives|_|06 mean|_|04 to us|_|01 . i know|_|01 that it is tough|_|03 growing|_|07 up alone|_|02 in a world|_|08 without others . i know|_|01 that it is tough|_|03 to make|_|43 lasting|_|02 friends|_|01 .
the article|_|04 is touching|_|03 its great|_|01 about rebid families|_|01 who flee|_|01 to other countries|_|02 , are forced|_|01 to leave|_|12 them behind|_|02 . ” in another|_|01 neighborhood|_|04 of eastern|_|01 aleppo|_|01 , 83|_|01 - year|_|01 - old|_|01 freeman|_|01 salaam|_|01 lives|_|01 alone|_|02 in the home|_|03 where she raised|_|02 her children|_|02 and his|_|01 wife|_|01 , who suffers|_|02 from high|_|02 blood|_|01 pressure|_|02 and rheumatism|_|01 . mara|_|02 has received|_|12 unexpected|_|01 help|_|01 from another|_|01 son|_|01 , ha|_|02 meed|_|01 , who was visiting|_|07 from turkey|_|02 and became|_|04 trapped|_|04 in the city|_|01 when the government|_|01 imposed|_|01 its siege|_|01 several|_|03 weeks|_|01 ago|_|01
i think|_|01 it 's well|_|04 known|_|11 what the cia|_|01 has been doing through it 's torture|_|02 programs|_|02 of suspected|_|02 terrorists|_|01 at guantanamo|_|01 bay|_|01 . dr.|_|04 rosecrans a leading|_|03 psychiatrist|_|01 for the navy|_|01 was immersed|_|01 in treating|_|03 these patients|_|01 . she worked|_|01 there for almost|_|07 fifteen|_|01 years|_|03 and had difficulty|_|03 helping|_|02 out these traumatized|_|01 victims|_|02 after their incarceration|_|01 .
what an unfortunate|_|03 situation|_|02 -- and a total|_|03 shame|_|02 that regulations|_|01 on these conditions|_|01 are n't more thorough|_|01 . of course|_|01 the reputation|_|01 of the kennel|_|01 should be considered|_|05 suspect|_|02 now . the article|_|01 says|_|01 that the business|_|01 will remain|_|04 open|_|21 , but i think|_|13 it would be best|_|02 to close|_|01 up shop|_|01 . after a news|_|01 piece|_|01 like|_|02 this , i do n't think|_|13 many|_|01 owners|_|01 will be bringing|_|02 their pets|_|01 to stay|_|04 .
reading|_|06 about the issue|_|02 of racism|_|02 in this country|_|04 brings|_|01 to many|_|01 various|_|02 thoughts|_|01 . the first|_|02 of these being , truly|_|01 , we can not legislate|_|01 thought|_|02 itself . either|_|01 we champion|_|01 free|_|01 speech|_|04 for those we find|_|10 abhorrent|_|01 , or we stop|_|04 pretending|_|07 to care|_|02 about liberty|_|02 . people|_|01 will always|_|04 suck|_|03 . at a certain|_|07 point|_|03 , it seems|_|02 we as a society|_|02 have gotten|_|01 a lot|_|05 softer|_|01 , even|_|04 as life|_|01 has become|_|01 more comfortable|_|02 . racists|_|01 are morons|_|02 . do i walk|_|09 around|_|04 stressed|_|07 all day|_|04 about racists|_|01 ? hell|_|06 no .
it is extremely|_|01 upsetting|_|01 that there is a cultural|_|02 war|_|01 going|_|01 on and no one|_|01 seems|_|02 to care|_|02 . the values|_|04 of muslims|_|01 in general|_|02 are not compatible|_|01 with western|_|03 culture|_|02 . further|_|05 more , it is an ideology|_|01 that promotes|_|02 violence|_|01 and terrorism|_|01 . until people|_|03 become|_|01 less|_|02 tolerant|_|05 of this disgusting|_|02 dogma|_|02 , things|_|09 like|_|02 this will continue|_|02 to happen|_|01 . if muslims|_|01 want|_|01 to be viewed|_|05 in a better|_|13 light|_|09 in the west|_|08 , they need|_|02 to work|_|27 on reforming|_|06 their religion|_|02 from within|_|02 .
i can not believe|_|01 what i 'm reading|_|05 . details|_|03 of that wells|_|05 fargo|_|01 new|_|06 accounts|_|05 scam|_|01 , how the lowly|_|01 bank|_|02 tellers|_|03 would make|_|08 up accounts|_|05 because they were paid|_|10 so low|_|01 and badgered|_|01 so much|_|01 that they felt|_|01 obligated|_|01 to cheat|_|01 like|_|02 this . for shame|_|02 . i 'm surprised|_|01 these details|_|03 did n't get|_|02 really|_|01 publicized|_|01 when this thing|_|09 was happening|_|04 .
" i just read|_|03 that kevin meany|_|01 , a stand|_|04 up comedian|_|02 and actor|_|02 has died|_|03 . although i do n’t remember|_|07 him very well|_|12 , according|_|01 to the article|_|02 i read|_|03 he was a celebrity|_|01 of some notoriety|_|01 in the 1980 ’s and 1990 ’s . mr.|_|01 meany|_|01 was in the cbs sitcom|_|02 " " uncle|_|02 buck|_|01 , " " it was only on for one|_|06 season|_|02 in 1990 , and he made|_|01 an appearance|_|06 on an episode|_|03 of " " saturday|_|01 night|_|01 live|_|07 . he was on the johnny|_|01 carson|_|01 show|_|06 , too , which was the top|_|01 - rated|_|04 late|_|04 night|_|01 talk|_|05 show|_|06 for decades|_|01 . i really|_|01 miss|_|01 all the bright|_|03 comedic|_|02 talents|_|02 that launched|_|05 their careers|_|02 on the carson|_|01 show|_|06 . so many|_|01 of these great|_|02 comedians|_|02 of the past|_|02 have inspired|_|02 budding|_|01 comic|_|02 talents|_|02 of today|_|02 . they will be missed|_|01 ! "
how awful|_|01 . i have the feeling|_|05 things|_|11 like|_|04 this are going|_|01 to get|_|03 more and more common|_|09 - racists|_|01 are going|_|01 to feel|_|05 more comfortable|_|02 and much|_|01 bolder|_|02 if there 's someone|_|01 in office|_|03 that seems|_|02 to approve|_|02 of actions|_|01 like|_|04 these . we need|_|03 a leader|_|01 who takes|_|29 a strong|_|09 stance|_|01 against racism|_|02 and hate|_|01 crimes|_|02 like|_|04 this , or our country|_|04 will continue|_|02 to fracture|_|06 .
it 's fascinating|_|01 to think|_|12 that these celebrities|_|01 were fooled|_|01 so easily|_|03 by a regular|_|01 guy|_|03 . of course|_|04 the man|_|08 's actions|_|06 are reprehensible|_|01 , and his|_|01 jail|_|01 sentence|_|01 seems|_|02 reasonable|_|03 , but you 'd think|_|12 that celebrities|_|01 would be more conscious|_|03 of phishing attacks|_|09 . especially|_|01 since these people|_|01 gave|_|01 over their passwords|_|01 willingly|_|01 , it 's hard|_|03 to understand|_|04 the legal|_|05 precedent|_|04 for sending|_|02 someone|_|01 to jail|_|01 over this .
it 's really|_|01 disturbing|_|02 we have a president|_|01 that enables|_|01 all these terrible|_|01 behaviors|_|01 we are witnessing|_|02 unfold|_|04 before us|_|01 . i am happy|_|01 there movements|_|06 like|_|02 # me too exist|_|02 to show|_|01 people|_|03 that we will not tolerate|_|10 these kinds|_|01 of acts|_|02 . it 's like|_|02 these people|_|03 never|_|02 had mothers|_|05 or sisters|_|03 . the way|_|05 they act|_|02 is beyond|_|03 comprehension|_|01 and i hope|_|03 the media|_|08 keeps|_|09 exposing|_|02 people|_|03 who have bad|_|13 intentions|_|03 .
people|_|01 are up in arms|_|01 over trump|_|02 not believing|_|01 in climate|_|02 change|_|01 . withdrawing|_|01 from the paris|_|04 treaty|_|01 supposedly|_|01 will contribute|_|01 to global|_|01 warming|_|02 , along|_|03 with doing away|_|02 with the clean|_|04 air|_|08 act|_|02 obama passed|_|01 while in office|_|04 . there 's so much|_|01 involved|_|01 with climate|_|02 change|_|01 its hard|_|02 to tell|_|05 what is fact|_|03 . states|_|04 are taking|_|05 measures|_|01 into their own hands|_|09 to the extent|_|02 they can i guess|_|02 .
it is a very interesting|_|01 article|_|04 . quite|_|03 a good|_|15 read|_|01 and has important|_|01 information|_|05 . the article|_|04 did really|_|01 communicate|_|01 to me i felt|_|03 like|_|02 the author|_|01 was talking|_|03 to me trying|_|01 to relay|_|01 some sort|_|03 of information|_|05 . i like|_|02 the use|_|03 of language|_|01 that the author|_|01 uses|_|04 , very simple|_|01 and easy|_|04 to understand|_|03 for everyone . please|_|02 read|_|03 it .
hearing|_|03 about the violence|_|03 going|_|01 on over politics|_|05 in the country|_|04 is really|_|01 sad|_|02 and upsetting|_|04 . it 's easy|_|03 to take|_|09 for granted|_|05 how we live|_|01 and how lucky|_|01 we are that we do n't have to worry|_|06 about people|_|01 killing|_|01 us|_|01 on a daily|_|01 basis|_|02 . our government|_|02 is also|_|02 democratic|_|01 which means|_|04 people|_|01 have a voice|_|07 . this is n't the case|_|06 in some areas/
hey , this is one|_|05 reason|_|06 i do n't get|_|01 on rides|_|02 at amusement|_|01 parks|_|06 anymore|_|01 . they are not reliable|_|01 and they freak|_|01 me out thinking|_|03 that they are going|_|01 to break|_|02 . i got|_|01 stuck|_|01 on a roller|_|07 coaster|_|03 one|_|05 time|_|04 and i hated|_|01 it . i was scared|_|01 out of my mind|_|01 . that was the last|_|05 time|_|04 i ever|_|01 got|_|01 on a ride|_|02 . i 'm not putting|_|04 myself though|_|01 that again no matter|_|02 how fun|_|02 the rides|_|02 used|_|01 to be . that must|_|01 have been a horrible|_|03 death|_|05 for those people|_|03 .
i just read|_|03 an article|_|04 about numerous|_|01 female|_|02 athletes|_|01 that of taking|_|35 the world|_|08 by storm|_|03 . i love|_|01 hearing|_|02 about female|_|03 athletes|_|01 , however|_|02 it was frustrating|_|02 to read|_|03 an article|_|04 with so many|_|01 typos|_|01 , miss|_|01 spellings|_|01 , errors|_|04 and words|_|01 that did’t make|_|02 sense|_|03 put|_|04 together|_|05 . the article|_|04 was clearly|_|01 not proof|_|01 read|_|01 before being published|_|01 where i read|_|03 it . for such an important|_|05 topic|_|01 , proofreading|_|01 would have been easy|_|03 .
this is another|_|01 story|_|03 of government|_|02 overreach|_|01 . big|_|01 government|_|02 pushed|_|02 by authoritarian|_|01 leftists|_|01 making|_|02 a big|_|01 deal|_|06 over nonsense|_|01 and holding|_|03 back|_|04 human|_|03 progression|_|02 in the name|_|06 of hippy|_|01 bullshit|_|01 . if a species|_|01 is endangered|_|01 it deserves|_|01 it 's fate|_|04 . more species|_|01 have went|_|01 extinct|_|01 in the time|_|06 before humans|_|02 existed|_|01 than in our entire|_|02 existence|_|01 . it 's a non|_|01 problem|_|01 and just how the world|_|01 works|_|27 .
there was a person|_|01 in the articles|_|04 that was muslim|_|01 and at a bar|_|05 for nightly|_|01 events|_|01 . they got|_|02 into a dispute|_|01 with another|_|01 person|_|01 and then the other person|_|01 killed|_|07 them . the investigators|_|01 said|_|01 something about donald trump|_|02 and his|_|01 hatred|_|01 toward muslim|_|01 people|_|01 maybe|_|01 having something to do with making|_|08 the murderer|_|01 feel|_|02 justified|_|02 in his|_|01 actions|_|01 .
i think|_|01 lung|_|01 cancer|_|01 is not really|_|01 caused|_|02 too highly|_|01 by air|_|01 pollution|_|01 . i feel|_|05 that the number|_|07 one|_|01 pollutants|_|01 that cause|_|01 lung|_|01 cancer|_|01 is purely|_|01 smoking|_|01 . in glad|_|03 i quit|_|01 smoking|_|01 years|_|03 ago|_|01 . they say|_|09 these scientific|_|02 reports|_|02 and studies|_|10 provide|_|06 that the air|_|01 pollution|_|01 caused|_|02 early|_|05 stage|_|04 lung|_|01 cancers|_|01 , however|_|04 i really|_|01 just do n't believe|_|01 it .
this is going|_|01 to sound|_|02 insensitive|_|02 , but this article|_|04 was rather|_|01 dry|_|01 . and i just realized|_|02 that that was a horrible|_|03 pun|_|01 . anyways|_|01 , this article|_|04 is illustrating|_|03 the harm|_|01 of over pumping|_|01 water|_|02 sources|_|07 in dhaka|_|01 , bangladesh|_|01 . it sounds|_|02 like|_|02 a really|_|01 terrible|_|01 situation|_|03 , with arsenic|_|01 being a terrible|_|01 poison|_|02 that 's being pushed|_|09 around|_|02 by all of this negligence|_|02 . you should read|_|03 it .
this is an incredibly|_|01 one|_|02 sided|_|01 article|_|04 . not sure|_|04 how they are even|_|01 allowed|_|01 to publish|_|03 stuff|_|05 like|_|02 this . it is amazing|_|01 they had to reference|_|01 black|_|04 lives|_|11 matter|_|06 , and all of sudden|_|01 this guy|_|03 was an upstanding|_|01 citizen|_|01 . there is always|_|04 a reason|_|06 an office|_|04 pulls|_|16 the trigger|_|03 . sometimes|_|01 , it is an accident|_|01 , but more often|_|05 that not , it is not . hopefully|_|02 they will publish|_|03 the toxicology|_|01 report|_|03 . wo n't hold|_|05 my breath|_|05 though|_|01 .
hay|_|01 ! although this story|_|02 is sad|_|02 , i found|_|02 it definitely|_|01 alarming|_|02 and should serve|_|07 as an example|_|01 on how this obsession|_|02 with selfless|_|01 needs|_|02 to stop|_|05 . apparently|_|01 , a guy|_|03 was killed|_|01 by a python|_|03 because he was trying|_|01 to take|_|02 a good|_|17 selfish|_|01 . i think|_|11 he was one|_|01 of those people|_|03 who like|_|02 to take|_|02 selfless|_|01 doing something daring|_|02
i have never|_|02 heard|_|02 of any of the people|_|03 mentioned|_|01 in this article|_|04 . i did not even|_|01 know|_|07 that there is a monarchy|_|01 in thailand|_|01 . it sounds|_|02 like|_|02 the king|_|10 that died|_|11 recently|_|01 was very well|_|12 liked|_|02 by the thai|_|01 people|_|03 . anyway|_|02 , i hope|_|03 that this lady|_|03 heals|_|02 quickly|_|01 from her illness|_|01 and that she has a prompt|_|02 recovery|_|03 .
if you hear|_|02 a ringing|_|07 in your occasionally|_|01 , do n't be too alarmed|_|01 . if you hear|_|02 it persistently|_|02 for quite|_|04 some time|_|06 , i would be slightly|_|01 worried|_|01 and definitely|_|01 more alarmed|_|01 . this could mean|_|01 that you eventually|_|01 lose|_|08 your hearing|_|06 . tinnitus|_|01 is a common|_|06 thing|_|08 to experience|_|03 and usually|_|01 is nothing|_|01 . but sometimes|_|01 this can be an early|_|03 sign|_|01 that you could lose|_|08 your hearing|_|06 . i strongly|_|01 encourage|_|03 people|_|01 to go|_|03 and get|_|21 this checked|_|08 if they experience|_|03 frequently|_|01 and definitely|_|01 educate|_|01 yourself on it .
wow|_|02 . so sad|_|02 to see|_|05 yet|_|04 another|_|01 species|_|01 on the way|_|06 to extinction|_|06 . it 's crazy|_|05 to think|_|05 that there 's only 60|_|01 of one|_|05 species|_|01 left|_|12 in the world|_|01 . i know|_|11 that it was the same way|_|06 with the white|_|12 rhino|_|01 - it was like|_|02 we knew|_|11 it was coming|_|02 , but we were completely|_|01 unable|_|02 to stop|_|01 it , because it was just too late|_|06 . i wonder|_|01 if they could keep|_|02 them in captivity|_|01 .
i just ca|_|01 n't imagine|_|02 how you would go|_|03 from having a good|_|13 day|_|01 snorkeling|_|01 with your loved|_|02 one|_|05 and be dead|_|01 the next|_|02 just how that would happen|_|01 ? then not to mention|_|01 your spouse|_|01 dies|_|01 right|_|01 alongside|_|03 you in the same mystical|_|03 way|_|12 , it just seems|_|04 like|_|02 there is more to it then that . it would seem|_|04 like|_|02 something had to of happened|_|01 .
i feel|_|05 bad|_|09 for the migrants|_|01 who died|_|11 when the ship|_|01 which was carrying|_|02 them sunk|_|03 . especially|_|01 the young|_|01 ones|_|02 . kids|_|05 should n't have to die|_|11 like|_|02 this just trying|_|01 to take|_|02 a risk|_|04 to improve|_|02 their lives|_|02 . i am touched|_|01 by the state|_|06 of the tiger|_|02 population|_|02 . they should never|_|02 be raised|_|07 and kept|_|09 in this fashion|_|01 . they deserve|_|01 to be free|_|03 . on top|_|09 of this rare|_|05 species|_|01 should always|_|04 be protected|_|01 .
wow|_|01 its just amazing|_|01 to me how many|_|01 countries|_|04 look|_|07 the other way|_|06 while civilians|_|01 are being killed|_|09 or injured|_|04 . over 300|_|01 killed|_|02 and over 400|_|01 injured|_|01 in less|_|03 then one|_|06 month|_|01 . there is no excuse|_|02 for this . there is nothing|_|01 on earth|_|01 that should make|_|36 this ok|_|01 . i am sad|_|02 for them . so many|_|01 lives|_|01 are affected|_|01 when will it stop|_|01 ?
i just read|_|08 the article|_|04 and i want|_|01 to say|_|01 i think|_|01 its terrible|_|01 anyone would actually|_|02 blame|_|03 the doctors|_|01 for someone|_|01 committing|_|01 suicide|_|01 . of course|_|04 its incredibly|_|01 sad|_|02 and i feel|_|02 for anyone that has to go|_|02 through what people|_|01 like|_|02 that do go|_|02 through but how can these doctors|_|01 be blamed|_|03 . that means|_|04 that anyone can be blamed|_|03 for missing|_|02 the signs|_|01 and its too hard|_|01 to tell|_|01 when someone|_|01 will actually|_|02 commit|_|01 to killing|_|01 themselves even|_|04 when they are making|_|43 empty|_|04 threats|_|03 .
before social|_|04 media|_|02 , you had to pay|_|10 to get|_|01 out information|_|05 about your business|_|01 . now , every|_|02 person|_|01 and company|_|03 is its own media|_|02 brand|_|03 - and there are significantly|_|01 less|_|03 barriers|_|02 to reaching|_|01 people.his has allowed|_|06 smaller|_|01 brands|_|03 to gain|_|08 a foothold|_|02 in the market|_|04 much|_|05 easier|_|12 . when we see|_|05 trends|_|04 like|_|02 craft|_|02 beer|_|01 , food|_|01 trucks|_|01 , and local|_|03 fashion|_|01 , that is often|_|05 the result|_|01 of harnessing|_|07 social|_|04 media|_|02 platforms|_|04 to build|_|01 a following|_|04 in a cost|_|01 effective|_|02 way|_|02 . prior|_|01 to smartphone and social|_|04 adoption|_|02 , it was much|_|05 more difficult|_|01 ( and expensive|_|01 ) to reach|_|01 people|_|01 , especially|_|01 if your location|_|04 awns’t on a main|_|03 street|_|05 . one|_|01 or two|_|01 small|_|01 businesses|_|01 sin’t enough|_|01 to worry|_|06 a big|_|01 brand|_|03 , but millions|_|01 of them around|_|01 the country|_|04 can make|_|08 a serious|_|06 dent|_|01 in their market|_|04 share|_|01

it seems|_|02 that climate|_|02 change|_|06 is still|_|01 a big|_|01 threat|_|03 to animals|_|01 and wildlife|_|01 , but not necessarily|_|03 in the ways|_|11 we would first|_|01 think|_|13 of . climate|_|02 change|_|06 can affect|_|02 the habitats|_|01 of wild|_|01 animals|_|01 and cause|_|01 them to die|_|04 from things|_|05 like|_|02 lack|_|01 of water|_|02 , which is still|_|01 a big|_|01 deal|_|01 . it 's not the temperature|_|02 change|_|06 necessarily|_|03 but what happens|_|02 to things|_|05 like|_|02 the habitat|_|01 .

it is amazing|_|01 how little|_|01 it takes|_|29 for some people|_|01 to harm|_|01 or kill|_|01 another|_|01 person|_|01 . it seems|_|02 like|_|02 there is a breakdown|_|02 or morals|_|01 in our society|_|02 . we have become|_|01 more animus|_|01 and disconnected|_|01 from others where we live|_|02 , in large|_|06 cities|_|03 . with no connections|_|01 to others some people|_|01 in our society|_|02 act|_|04 out their aggression|_|04 on others .

wow|_|02 , i feel|_|13 really|_|01 bad|_|01 for the parishioners|_|01 of the church|_|04 that got|_|28 burned|_|01 down . at least|_|01 nobody|_|04 was injured|_|05 . on the one|_|06 hand|_|07 , it 's crazy|_|05 that people|_|01 would do this , but on the other hand|_|07 , i 'm not exactly|_|03 surprised|_|01 . trump|_|02 has been inciting|_|02 racial|_|01 hatred|_|01 and tearing|_|05 down standards|_|05 of decent|_|06 behavior|_|01 since before the beginning|_|01 of his|_|01 campaign|_|01 . let|_|03 's hope|_|02 he loses|_|11 in november|_|01 and we can file|_|02 this away|_|10 as a disgraceful|_|01 moment|_|06 in american|_|01 history|_|05 , nothing|_|01 more .

it really|_|01 is too bad|_|01 that this had to happen|_|04 . the internet|_|01 will never|_|01 let|_|02 them forget|_|02 . i 'm sure|_|02 the zookeepers feel|_|06 awful|_|01 about what has transpired|_|04 . after all , they are probably|_|01 all great|_|03 lovers|_|03 of animals|_|01 and you and i know|_|05 that it is never|_|01 easy|_|03 to see|_|01 a poor|_|06 animal|_|01 die|_|03 . i wonder|_|02 if there were things|_|11 to be done that could have prevented|_|01 this or if i am just thinking|_|01 with insight|_|04 .
it 's a shame|_|01 how troubled|_|01 the middle|_|04 east|_|03 is and has been for the longest|_|01 time|_|03 . i wish|_|04 we could come|_|04 to some agreement|_|06 with the rest|_|04 of the world|_|01 on how to realistically|_|01 handle|_|02 the multiple|_|01 situations|_|01 in the middle|_|04 east|_|03 . i feel|_|05 that we should pull|_|04 out and let|_|01 them handle|_|02 their problems|_|01 on their own with only some guidance|_|02 from us|_|01 .

this is such a sad|_|02 story|_|02 . i blame|_|02 the owner|_|02 of the dog|_|01 . she should not have had her dog|_|01 off leash|_|01 . a big|_|08 dog|_|01 like|_|02 that can really|_|01 scare|_|01 someone|_|01 . not everyone is a dog|_|01 lover|_|01 like|_|02 we are . poor|_|01 mace|_|01 had to feel|_|05 the pain|_|02 because her owner|_|02 was n't doing the right|_|08 thing|_|11 . perhaps|_|01 the fine|_|01 for having dogs|_|01 off leash|_|01 will result|_|03 in people|_|01 not taking|_|03 their dogs|_|01 off leash|_|01 when they walk|_|10 . take|_|03 them to a dog|_|01 park|_|02 and let|_|01 them run|_|11 .

i have read|_|09 the article|_|01 and think|_|13 that it 's a story|_|01 i have read|_|09 many|_|01 times|_|06 . isis|_|01 claims|_|05 that the person|_|01 is part|_|01 of their army|_|01 , but there is no evidence|_|01 that the person|_|01 was supported|_|03 by them . it also|_|02 shows|_|10 that it 's almost|_|07 impossible|_|03 to tell|_|07 whether someone|_|01 will become|_|04 a terrorist|_|01 based|_|08 on their personality|_|01 or what religion|_|02 they are .
it is so sad|_|02 and terrible|_|01 how these alternative|_|03 medicine|_|05 manufacturers|_|02 take|_|01 advantage|_|01 of people|_|03 . so many|_|01 people|_|03 believe|_|01 that these things|_|11 are healthier|_|04 or will make|_|43 them feel|_|05 better|_|13 than traditional|_|02 medication|_|02 , but clearly|_|01 they just make|_|43 things|_|11 worse|_|01 . these companies|_|03 pray|_|01 on uneducated|_|01 people|_|03 and it leads|_|03 to such terrible|_|01 outcomes|_|03 . these people|_|03 do n't deserve|_|01 these health|_|01 problems|_|01 .
oh|_|01 my gosh this is so awful|_|02 . i feel|_|03 so bad|_|01 for this man|_|10 and his|_|01 family|_|02 , as well|_|01 as the mother|_|01 of the child|_|02 . could you imagine|_|02 getting|_|01 hurt|_|04 , nearly|_|07 being rescued|_|02 , and then the helicopter|_|01 failing|_|11 too ? talk|_|02 about terrible|_|02 luck|_|02 . i hope|_|02 they start|_|08 a groundsmen|_|01 for this man|_|10 and his|_|01 family|_|02 - we should all donate|_|01 if they do .
here 's an article|_|04 about crazed|_|01 person|_|01 who murdered|_|01 two|_|01 unfortunate|_|03 women|_|02 overseas|_|02 . life|_|08 is crazy|_|03 . i ca|_|01 n't imagine|_|02 what the families|_|01 are going|_|03 through . having to go|_|03 to or being forced|_|02 into sex|_|03 work|_|01 is bad|_|09 enough|_|01 , but for it to end|_|03 like|_|02 this is just sad|_|02 . it feels|_|05 like|_|02 there 's no place|_|01 safe|_|01 in this world|_|01 to be a woman|_|02 sometimes|_|01 .
have a friend|_|01 i wrote|_|07 a letter|_|03 for , and gave|_|01 it to her on her birthday|_|02 . in the beginning|_|01 i wrote|_|07 about how our friendship|_|01 began|_|07 , and wrote|_|07 about all of my favorite|_|01 memories|_|03 with her from as far|_|04 back|_|04 as i could remember|_|07 . our first|_|01 interaction|_|02 to when we first|_|01 started|_|07 testing|_|01 and getting|_|02 to know|_|01 each other , all the way|_|05 up to when i wrote|_|07 the letter|_|03 . she is really|_|01 good|_|12 at always|_|04 telling|_|02 me how she feels|_|11 about me and how grateful|_|01 she is to have me as a friend|_|01 . i usually|_|01 suck|_|01 at reciprocating|_|01 , so i took|_|15 this as an opportunity|_|01 to tell|_|02 her what she meant|_|01 to me . i made|_|03 the end|_|05 of the letter|_|03 forward|_|02 looking|_|02 and wrote|_|07 of how grateful|_|01 i considered|_|01 myself to be because she was in my life|_|01 , and how i hoped|_|06 that would’t change|_|06 for a long|_|01 , long|_|01 time|_|06 .
the great|_|01 barrier|_|03 reef|_|01 ( gr ) is not dead|_|16 , apparently|_|01 , after all ! while the reef|_|01 is mostly|_|01 destroyed|_|04 , it has sections|_|01 that are coming|_|04 back|_|06 to life|_|02 , and it can be stimulated|_|04 back|_|06 to recovery|_|03 despite|_|02 a 2016 article|_|03 proclaiming|_|02 that it had suffered|_|10 its death|_|05 stroke|_|02 . did you know|_|10 it can be seen|_|01 from outer space|_|05 ? how magnificent|_|03 ! we should do what we can to preserve|_|02 it , even|_|04 if it is a losing|_|03 cause|_|01 because it is a true|_|12 wonder|_|02 of nature|_|03 . i know|_|10 that contradicts|_|06 what i told|_|02 you earlier|_|02 about not trying|_|01 to save|_|02 species|_|01 , but hey , whoever said|_|01 consistency|_|04 was my greatest|_|03 attribute|_|02 ?
i ca|_|01 n't believe|_|01 just how much|_|01 manipulation|_|01 went|_|03 on behind|_|01 the scenes|_|06 of donald trumps|_|02 campaign|_|01 . i feel|_|05 like|_|02 we will never|_|02 know|_|05 the true|_|12 extend|_|03 of how corrupt|_|02 his|_|01 whole|_|02 deal|_|06 was . first|_|02 you hear|_|02 about all these huge|_|01 collections|_|01 of data|_|01 and then you get|_|02 the dots|_|09 who defend|_|02 him about climate|_|02 change|_|06 being fake|_|02 .
i feel|_|11 really|_|01 bad|_|01 for the woman|_|01 , janis stravinsky|_|02 , this article|_|04 is writing|_|02 about . nobody|_|04 should have to go|_|01 through such torture|_|05 and borderline|_|01 abuse|_|01 at their workplace|_|01 to endure|_|01 this type|_|06 of behavior|_|01 and thoughts|_|01 . for a company|_|01 to treat|_|01 their employees|_|01 this way|_|09 and to push|_|01 them to the verge|_|04 of suicide|_|02 is just out right|_|03 awful|_|01 .
there was another|_|01 gunman|_|02 attacking|_|03 random|_|01 people|_|01 in houston|_|02 . i think|_|09 it 's so scary|_|01 and disgusting|_|02 . mental|_|01 health|_|02 these days|_|01 seem|_|02 to be at a all time|_|02 low|_|01 and it 's showing|_|02 left|_|01 and right|_|12 . we need|_|02 to do something about people|_|01 who do n't act|_|02 like|_|02 humans|_|02 anymore|_|01 . they lose|_|01 all empathy|_|01 for others and just want|_|02 to end|_|02 their life|_|03 in a cowardly|_|01 way|_|01 .
it is too bad|_|01 that so many|_|01 people|_|01 still|_|03 deny|_|03 that pollution|_|01 and man|_|08 made|_|02 climate|_|02 change|_|01 is destroying|_|04 our natural|_|04 world|_|08 . it makes|_|02 me wonder|_|03 what will be left|_|08 for my grandchildren|_|01 to enjoy|_|02 of our natural|_|04 world|_|08 . in my life|_|01 i have noticed|_|01 the degradation|_|01 of the outdoors|_|01 to a fair|_|07 extent|_|02 and it is only accelerating|_|02 . woe|_|02 to mankind|_|08 .
the war|_|02 on terror|_|04 that began|_|03 with the initial|_|01 war|_|02 of america|_|01 on afghanistan|_|01 for the purpose|_|01 of eliminating|_|04 taliban|_|01 and restoring|_|05 order|_|02 and democracy|_|01 there but this war|_|02 has continue|_|03 for quite|_|04 some time|_|06 and has turned|_|18 the country|_|02 in ruined|_|04 . i think|_|11 its about time|_|06 we leave|_|02 that country|_|02 for good|_|12 and let|_|05 them live|_|01 there life|_|01
i just read|_|05 an article|_|04 about an elementary|_|02 school|_|02 volunteer|_|02 producing|_|03 child|_|01 porn|_|01 with kids|_|01 as young|_|01 as nine|_|01 . this is absolutely|_|01 disgusting|_|02 . how can anyone violate|_|01 our sweet|_|04 children|_|01 like|_|02 that . he gave|_|18 out cell|_|01 phones|_|01 and used|_|06 an anonymous|_|02 social|_|04 media|_|01 app to solicit|_|12 videos|_|01 and photos|_|01 of boys|_|01 and girls|_|02 performing|_|03 sexual|_|02 acts|_|02 :( i am so perturbed|_|01 that people|_|01 are so disgusting|_|02 . i can promise|_|04 you if this ever|_|03 happens|_|01 to any of my kids|_|01 they are going|_|01 to be a very sorry|_|01 person|_|01 .
there was more bombing|_|02 over in syria|_|01 in the news|_|01 over the weekend|_|01 . there were over 300|_|01 casualties|_|01 including|_|03 small|_|03 children|_|02 . a father|_|01 and son|_|01 were found|_|01 dead|_|16 in the rubble|_|01 as well|_|07 as two|_|01 boys|_|01 whose mother|_|01 survived|_|02 in an adjoining|_|05 room|_|01 . it seems|_|02 like|_|02 the violence|_|03 in the middle|_|04 east|_|05 is never|_|02 ending|_|04 .
i found|_|01 this article|_|04 and thought|_|10 you might|_|01 be interested|_|01 in it . this is so sad|_|01 and disgusting|_|02 . gun|_|02 violence|_|03 really|_|01 must|_|01 be stopped|_|03 in this country|_|04 and it 's hurting|_|02 innocent|_|07 people|_|01 and even|_|03 unborn|_|01 people|_|01 around|_|01 this country|_|04 . i think|_|10 there might|_|01 be a die|_|03 in we can participate|_|01 in happening|_|04 this week|_|01 if you can come|_|13 .
this sounds|_|02 like|_|02 a murder|_|01 - suicide|_|02 situation|_|02 . that 's what it always|_|04 is when you hear|_|02 there is no danger|_|02 to the public|_|02 . how awful|_|02 that people|_|01 choose|_|02 to do this to each other and how awful|_|02 that some poor|_|01 kid|_|02 had to be a witness|_|01 to it all . that child|_|02 will never|_|02 be the same again . i wonder|_|03 why people|_|01 who choose|_|02 to do something like|_|02 this ca|_|01 n't just kill|_|01 themselves and leave|_|12 everyone around|_|01 them alone|_|02 . it 's sick|_|01 .
so i read|_|06 an article|_|04 on leon|_|03 russell|_|07 passing|_|01 away|_|06 . i really|_|01 do not listen|_|02 to rock|_|01 and roll|_|13 music|_|05 like|_|02 that , but from the article|_|04 you can just see|_|05 how many|_|01 people|_|03 he has touched|_|02 in his|_|01 life|_|01 in positive|_|01 ways|_|01 . there was even|_|04 a quote|_|01 from elton john|_|01 talking|_|02 about how influential|_|01 russel was in his|_|01 own life|_|01 , and the impact|_|02 he had on his|_|01 stardom|_|01 .
can you believe|_|01 how people|_|03 are acting|_|02 over this ? they are acting|_|02 like|_|02 a bunch|_|01 of rabid|_|01 animals|_|01 . this is not how you protest|_|03 . going|_|02 around|_|04 acting|_|02 violent|_|01 and destroying|_|04 things|_|09 does not solve|_|01 anything . this is chaos|_|04 . there is no excuse|_|01 for this type|_|01 of behavior|_|01 just because you do n't agree|_|01 with an election|_|02 .
from this article|_|04 i read|_|06 82|_|01 percent|_|01 of ecosystems|_|01 are being impacted|_|01 by climate|_|02 change|_|06 . what s interesting|_|01 about this is the environment|_|02 and the species|_|01 in these ecosystems|_|01 are going|_|03 through morphological|_|01 changes|_|06 . sometimes|_|01 we get|_|02 this idea|_|03 that climate|_|02 change|_|06 will eradicate|_|02 all life|_|01 from the earth|_|01 but it seems|_|02 that we will be able|_|01 to adapt|_|01 to it to a certain|_|01 extent|_|01 . by no means|_|01 am i say|_|02 we should n't make|_|02 changes|_|06 to solve|_|01 climate|_|02 change|_|06 but it is interesting|_|01 to seem|_|02 how life|_|01 is adapting|_|01 to the changes|_|06 .
i am so tired|_|01 of hearing|_|02 about this stuff|_|01 , it 's so fake|_|02 . trump|_|02 is just a fake|_|02 conservative|_|02 , the same way|_|05 that all of the liberals|_|02 are fake|_|02 liberals|_|02 . trump|_|02 is far|_|05 from a kkk|_|01 icon|_|01 , he 's actually|_|02 a jew|_|01 and a huge|_|01 supporter|_|01 of zionism|_|01 / israel- this should make|_|19 him a huge|_|01 enemy|_|02 of the kkk|_|01 but instead|_|01 it 's all fake|_|02 , orchestrated|_|01 bs|_|01 to keep|_|04 us|_|01 totally|_|01 distracted|_|01 from what 's really|_|01 up .
remember|_|07 that you where telling|_|01 me about how you were having trouble|_|04 sleeping|_|02 lately|_|01 ? maybe|_|01 you should take|_|01 a look|_|02 at this article|_|04 that i found|_|02 online|_|03 about sleep|_|03 paralysis|_|01 and what it is all about and how it is affecting|_|05 this guy|_|03 . i hope|_|03 that it can help|_|03 you out a little|_|02 bit|_|02 with what you have been going|_|01 through .
this article|_|01 is about as part|_|01 of its fight|_|05 against childhood|_|02 obesity|_|01 , the organization|_|01 of nations|_|04 has called|_|03 on member|_|04 states|_|02 to introduce|_|05 restrictions|_|03 on advertising|_|01 of aforementioned|_|01 products|_|05 on all platforms|_|03 including|_|03 the internet|_|01 . in 2012 in europe|_|01 , said|_|01 the who , children|_|04 use|_|06 ‘ digital|_|03 media|_|01 ’ for nearly|_|07 two|_|01 hours|_|04 daily|_|01 on weekdays|_|01 . and on weekends|_|01 , they ’re online|_|03 an extra|_|03 half|_|01 an hour|_|04 longer|_|01 . internet|_|01 use|_|01 is increasing|_|01 sharply|_|01 , the organization|_|01 added|_|01 , and the trend|_|01 covers|_|01 all age|_|01 groups|_|02 . hidden|_|01 junk|_|02 food|_|02 ads|_|01 online|_|03 for starters|_|07 , google|_|01 , facebook and youtube are the sites|_|01 with most daily|_|01 visits|_|04 online|_|03 . meanwhile|_|02 , android|_|01 and iphone ( os ) are the top|_|01 platforms|_|03 on hand|_|13 - held|_|03 communication|_|03 devices|_|05 , and they also|_|02 have advertisements|_|01 via applications|_|03 .
an endangered|_|01 species|_|01 of polar|_|01 bears|_|01 have seen|_|02 an increase|_|05 in the number|_|07 of them killed|_|02 by visitors|_|01 , or hunters|_|01 . look|_|02 at how the people|_|03 are apparently|_|01 organizing|_|05 against the threat|_|03 to these wonderful|_|02 , and endangered|_|01 creatures|_|03 . i 'm not sure|_|07 if they can turn|_|20 the tide|_|02 , there are a lot|_|02 of bad|_|01 people|_|03 out there who hunt|_|07 for sport|_|04 , but they can surely|_|01 slow|_|03 it down , and that 's a good|_|15 thing|_|12 . i hope|_|02 their efforts|_|01 are strong|_|07 enough|_|01 that this wonderful|_|02 species|_|01 can be preserved|_|06 , intact|_|02 , in their natural|_|04 habitat|_|01 .
i know|_|01 people|_|03 tend|_|03 to get|_|01 really|_|01 angry|_|01 at law|_|01 enforcement|_|01 when a shooting|_|02 or bombing|_|01 does n't get|_|01 prevented|_|02 , but i feel|_|05 like|_|02 it is way|_|01 too complicated|_|02 of an issue|_|01 . i just read|_|06 and article|_|04 about it , and for law|_|01 enforcement|_|01 to keep|_|02 enough|_|02 information|_|05 and follow|_|01 enough|_|01 leads|_|03 to prevent|_|02 every|_|02 attack|_|09 , we would need|_|01 to sacrifice|_|04 a lot|_|05 of our civil|_|02 liberties|_|02 . it is just not worth|_|01 it .
a priest|_|01 was abducted|_|01 and tortured|_|02 in mexico|_|01 . authorities|_|01 think|_|03 it was a robbery|_|01 but the church|_|01 is convinced|_|09 it was due|_|02 to him being a human|_|03 rights|_|01 activist|_|01 . it sucks|_|03 that it happened|_|04 but in all fairness|_|02 mexico|_|01 is a shit|_|01 hole|_|01 and well|_|03 known|_|01 for cartel|_|04 actions|_|01 such as this . how many|_|01 of your peers|_|02 have to get|_|01 abducted|_|01 and killed|_|01 or tortured|_|02 before you learn|_|02 to shut|_|02 the fuck|_|01 up or get|_|01 the fuck|_|01 out ? in the end|_|01 nobody|_|04 but themselves to blame|_|03 .
how disgusting|_|01 is wells|_|02 fargo|_|01 ? it 's unbelievable|_|01 the way|_|11 they treated|_|08 their tellers|_|03 , and all those fake|_|02 accounts|_|03 ? can you even|_|01 ? i do n't understand|_|01 how this bank|_|05 does n't get|_|01 shut|_|01 down . you really|_|01 should think|_|03 about getting|_|01 an account|_|03 with a different|_|03 bank|_|05 , you know|_|04 . what if your ss got|_|01 used|_|01 to make|_|02 some of those accounts|_|03 ?
colonialism|_|01 is a ugly|_|01 part|_|09 of american|_|02 history|_|04 , but it 's one|_|06 that we should n't forget|_|03 . we ca|_|01 n't undo|_|03 the damage|_|02 that we 've done , but we can teach|_|02 future|_|03 generations|_|01 our mistakes|_|02 , and hope|_|03 that they do not repeat|_|01 them . a formal|_|01 apology|_|02 is the very least|_|01 the canadian|_|01 government|_|02 can do , and it is admirable|_|02 .
wow|_|02 ! i can not believe|_|01 i forgot|_|01 about the erika virus|_|03 ! how can we advance|_|02 as a society|_|01 to try|_|01 to grasp|_|01 a better|_|18 understanding|_|01 of this deadly|_|06 virus|_|03 ? you would think|_|10 as advanced|_|07 as human|_|02 civilization|_|02 is we would understand|_|01 more . pregnant|_|02 women|_|02 who get|_|01 erika seem|_|02 to be in the most danger|_|02 . the effects|_|02 it can have on the fetus|_|01 is horrible|_|03 ! it is very scary|_|01 to know|_|11 that it can be passed|_|01 along|_|03 sexually|_|02 even|_|03 if a person|_|02 was not feeling|_|05 the symptoms|_|01 . africa|_|01 and asia|_|01 seems|_|02 to really|_|01 need|_|03 help|_|01 fro the rest|_|01 of the world|_|08 in fighting|_|01 this problem|_|01 !
this story|_|03 specifically|_|01 does n't make|_|08 me feel|_|05 anything , since i do n't know|_|05 these people|_|01 and i feel|_|05 like|_|02 if i tried|_|01 to have emotions|_|01 for every|_|02 victim|_|02 of a crime|_|02 i read|_|03 about that would just require|_|04 too much|_|01 mental|_|01 effort|_|01 . in a broader|_|01 sense|_|03 however|_|01 , i feel|_|05 frustrated|_|01 and tired|_|02 of having to deal|_|01 with men|_|01 committing|_|01 acts|_|04 of violence|_|03 against women|_|01 constantly|_|01 simply|_|04 because they can , especially|_|01 in cases|_|05 like|_|02 this where there did n't seem|_|02 to be much|_|01 prior|_|02 warning|_|04 . it 's irritating|_|01 because it is such an awful|_|01 trend|_|04 , so it makes|_|08 me feel|_|05 sort|_|01 of disgusted|_|02 with the state|_|02 of the world|_|08 in that way|_|01 .
it seems|_|02 like|_|01 the air|_|01 pollution|_|01 in india|_|01 is getting|_|02 worse|_|01 and this is especially|_|01 troubling|_|05 for children|_|04 who are very susceptible|_|01 to the open|_|01 air|_|01 . this is very alarming|_|02 as just recently|_|01 1,800 school|_|07 had been close|_|01 in india|_|01 because of the poor|_|06 air|_|01 quality|_|01 . it seem|_|02 that these particle|_|02 from the smog|_|01 and fireworks|_|01 are so tiny|_|01 that they can make|_|02 there way|_|02 in the small|_|01 pockets|_|02 of the lungs|_|01 .
i just read|_|09 a very upsetting|_|08 article|_|01 about a recent|_|01 incident|_|02 involving|_|05 u.s.|_|01 troops|_|03 in jordan|_|02 and i wanted|_|01 to share|_|01 it with you . there were three|_|02 u.s.|_|01 military|_|02 trainers|_|01 killed|_|02 in gunfire|_|01 by security|_|09 units|_|03 at jordan|_|02 base|_|01 , fatally|_|01 shot|_|02 by security|_|09 forces|_|01 friday|_|01 when their vehicle|_|03 failed|_|04 to stop|_|04 at the gate|_|04 of a military|_|02 base|_|01 . i have no idea|_|03 why the driver|_|02 did not stop|_|04 at the gate|_|04 , which is certainly|_|01 protocol|_|03 . they have had serious|_|01 problems|_|01 in jordan|_|02 recently|_|01 due|_|01 to hundreds|_|01 of thousands|_|01 of syrian|_|01 refugees|_|01 crossing|_|05 their border|_|03 . jordan|_|02 is and has been a significant|_|02 u.s.|_|01 ally|_|02 in the war|_|01 against isis|_|01 and i can only hope|_|02 that this incident|_|02 is isolated|_|05 and not part|_|01 of a bigger|_|01 problem|_|01 . god|_|01 bless|_|03 the families|_|08 of the deceased|_|01 soldiers|_|02 !
well|_|09 i just read|_|06 this ridiculously|_|01 long|_|02 article|_|04 about someone|_|01 who would take|_|09 vacations|_|01 with their family|_|01 i think|_|05 . the person|_|03 just talked|_|02 about some of their trips|_|01 , and talked|_|02 about how vacations|_|01 and travel|_|01 in general|_|05 can expand|_|01 you as a person|_|03 . i agree|_|07 with this claim|_|07 , and wish|_|02 traveling|_|01 could be a little|_|01 cheaper|_|01 .
looks|_|03 like|_|02 the drought|_|02 is n't only affecting|_|01 california|_|01 , the drought|_|02 is affecting|_|01 other regions|_|03 in the mid|_|01 west|_|08 . the drought|_|02 creating|_|03 drier|_|01 climates|_|02 making|_|03 them more susceptible|_|02 to fires|_|09 and that region|_|03 has already|_|01 lost|_|07 100,000 acres|_|03 to forest|_|01 fires|_|09 . the drought|_|02 is definitely|_|01 a major|_|08 issue|_|02 that needs|_|02 to be addressed|_|05 .
maybe|_|01 they should evaluate|_|02 him and figure|_|01 out why he did what he did so that when he gets|_|01 released|_|01 , he 's not tempted|_|06 to do it again . the story|_|01 really|_|01 did n't tell|_|01 why he did it or if he was mentally|_|01 challenged|_|03 or anything , it just says|_|01 that he injured|_|05 the bird|_|02 . the bird|_|02 is a sad|_|02 case|_|02 of what a zoo|_|02 is . those animals|_|01 should be in the wild|_|03 , and not cooped|_|01 up for people|_|03 to ooh|_|01 and aah|_|01 at them in a park|_|06
i did n't realize|_|08 just how much|_|01 discord|_|01 there was going|_|01 on in burma|_|01 . near|_|07 total|_|03 distrust|_|03 of the local|_|03 government|_|02 from segments|_|04 of the local|_|03 muslim|_|01 population|_|04 , it 's really|_|01 shocking|_|06 and concerning|_|02 to me . the roaring|_|03 apparently|_|01 are n't even|_|02 allowed|_|01 to worship|_|03 at their mosques|_|01 , nor are they allowed|_|01 to go|_|01 to work|_|03 to earn|_|08 a living|_|06 . it 's very concerning|_|02 to me that i hear|_|02 a member|_|01 of the government|_|02 seemingly|_|01 unconcerned|_|03 about how these people|_|01 are being treated|_|01 . enough|_|01 is n't being done , not nearly|_|07 enough|_|01 , by almost|_|07 all parities|_|01 involved|_|01 , to hear|_|02 some of the stories|_|03 of what is happening|_|04 on the ground|_|02 is really|_|01 heart|_|03 breaking|_|02 .
the thought|_|03 of suffering|_|11 from sleep|_|02 paralysis|_|01 is quite|_|04 unnerving|_|01 . it would seemingly|_|01 be akin|_|02 being a prisoner|_|01 in one|_|05 's own body|_|04 . i would encourage|_|01 anyone suffering|_|11 from such issues|_|02 to have such an issue|_|02 investigated|_|02 by a doctor|_|01 . it is very fortunate|_|03 that we live|_|01 in a time|_|01 where doctors|_|01 can assist|_|10 individuals|_|01 with such issues|_|02 , so people|_|01 should really|_|01 seek|_|01 help|_|02 .
while reading|_|03 the article|_|04 , i did not really|_|01 care|_|01 too much|_|01 about the protests|_|03 made|_|43 by people|_|03 in south|_|01 korea|_|01 against their president|_|02 mainly|_|01 because it is in south|_|01 korea|_|01 and not here in america|_|01 . although i did n't really|_|01 have much|_|01 concern|_|02 for the article|_|04 i just read|_|03 , i hope|_|03 that these protests|_|03 will end|_|04 in south|_|01 korea|_|01 .
ugh another|_|01 big|_|01 fight|_|02 in edinburgh|_|01 . the city|_|03 seems|_|02 to have all kinds|_|01 of problems|_|01 like|_|02 that . plus|_|04 they are kids|_|01 ! where are the parents|_|02 when the kids|_|01 are out there fighting|_|06 and attacking|_|03 people|_|03 in the street|_|05 . its just disgusting|_|01 . i 'm just happy|_|02 that their victim|_|02 was n't badly|_|03 hurt|_|06 , but unless these kids|_|01 face|_|02 consequences|_|01 they will just do it again and again . i think|_|01 their parents|_|02 should be held|_|29 liable|_|04 if their kids|_|01 do n't stop|_|01 acting|_|02 this way|_|11 because it is obviously|_|01 the fault|_|05 of the parents|_|02 for failing|_|04 to take|_|06 control|_|02 of their kids|_|01 .
i honestly|_|02 ca|_|01 nt|_|01 remember|_|02 what i read|_|03 . i walked|_|10 away|_|02 for a drink|_|01 and came|_|01 back|_|06 and i completely|_|01 forgot|_|04 . reading|_|03 these articles|_|04 like|_|02 this in succession|_|02 is tedious|_|01 and makes|_|42 the stories|_|03 all run|_|03 together|_|05 making|_|42 the retention|_|01 of the story|_|03 hard|_|08 to keep|_|02 . i would have reread|_|01 the article|_|04 if i could and there was an option|_|02 to
hey i just read|_|06 this article|_|04 about more craziness|_|03 isis|_|01 is doing ? sometimes|_|01 the articles|_|04 have so many|_|01 names|_|02 of places|_|01 i do n't recognize|_|02 and ca|_|01 n't pronounce|_|02 that i get|_|02 a little|_|08 off track|_|04 of the point|_|23 of the article|_|04 . i hues|_|01 those terrorists|_|01 are using|_|01 people|_|01 as human|_|03 shields|_|02 to keep|_|04 and take|_|01 control|_|11 or surroundings|_|02 areas|_|01 . they know|_|05 this is against un|_|01 policy|_|03 , but i doubt|_|02 they care|_|02 . there is always|_|04 something going|_|03 on in the middle|_|03 east|_|04 , it seems|_|02 nothing|_|01 gets|_|02 better|_|13 for the people|_|01 just trying|_|01 to live|_|05 . i feel|_|05 like|_|02 something should be done to improve|_|03 the situation|_|02 , but it 's been bad|_|01 since i was a kid|_|02 and i doubt|_|02 it 'll get|_|02 better|_|13 .
we need|_|01 to be more considerate|_|01 of climate|_|02 change|_|04 , its effects|_|01 are too dangerous|_|02 to ignore|_|04 . because of this , it 's easy|_|03 to recognize|_|04 the moral|_|02 imperative|_|02 we have to fulfill|_|04 our obligations|_|01 to society|_|04 . we would be remiss|_|03 to deny|_|07 these exact|_|01 warning|_|04 signs|_|01 , and we know|_|10 that scientists|_|01 have dedicated|_|18 their entire|_|02 lives|_|13 towards the subject|_|02 of climate|_|02 change|_|04 . we should heed|_|01 their collective|_|03 warning|_|04 immediately|_|03 .
this is yet|_|04 another|_|01 tragedy|_|02 in need|_|02 of our justice|_|02 ! this time|_|01 we have a plane|_|05 crash|_|02 that had killed|_|01 some very important|_|01 polish|_|01 people|_|03 . this has recently|_|01 come|_|02 under investigation|_|01 for foul|_|04 play|_|01 . these people|_|03 need|_|02 justice|_|02 in their case|_|01 and we should support|_|09 any justice|_|02 that will bring|_|01 the truth|_|05 out for these unfortunate|_|03 people|_|03 !
after reading|_|03 that the amphibian|_|01 population|_|05 and specifically|_|01 antivirus might|_|01 be caused|_|01 by humans|_|02 it makes|_|01 me sad|_|02 but i can understand|_|03 the situation|_|03 . we can often|_|03 do things|_|05 with unintended|_|01 consequences|_|03 that are not noticeable|_|01 in the beginning|_|01 . this appears|_|02 to be the thought|_|01 here that maybe|_|01 we have caused|_|01 these amphibians|_|03 to become|_|03 sick|_|06 because of carrying|_|02 the disease|_|01 in or perhaps|_|01 genetic|_|04 mutations|_|02 . either|_|01 way|_|11 , it is a sad|_|02 situation|_|03 that will hopefully|_|01 be able|_|03 to be reversed|_|05 before it is too late|_|06 but these types|_|06 of things|_|05 happen|_|04 in our society|_|04 without specific|_|04 intention|_|01 . i feel|_|11 for the little|_|08 froggings|_|01 though|_|01 and hope|_|03 science|_|02 can find|_|02 a way|_|11 to preserve|_|03 them and their habitat|_|01 .
i understand|_|02 why this is a problem|_|01 but i do n't see|_|02 any reason|_|03 to get|_|02 upset|_|06 over it . it seemed|_|02 like|_|02 they were writing|_|10 about it with more emotion|_|01 than the situation|_|01 deserves|_|01 . trees|_|03 die|_|03 all the time|_|02 . they 're replaced|_|03 by something else|_|03 . it 's extremely|_|01 common|_|09 . i get|_|02 that it 's worth|_|01 given|_|01 current|_|01 climate|_|02 conditions|_|01 but still|_|04 .
so , in india|_|01 there 's a lot|_|05 of corruption|_|05 and the prime|_|03 minister|_|02 made|_|08 a promise|_|01 to stop|_|01 it . he made|_|08 a pretty|_|01 extreme|_|04 decision|_|03 to get|_|02 rid|_|01 of the two|_|01 highest|_|01 denominations|_|02 of currency|_|01 in the country|_|02 , so that people|_|01 who were hoarding|_|02 cash|_|01 and not paying|_|01 taxes|_|01 on it would lose|_|07 out . there was a grace|_|01 period|_|07 , but the country|_|02 was really|_|01 unprepared|_|01 for it still|_|04 . the banks|_|02 did n't have enough|_|02 smaller|_|10 bills|_|03 to trade|_|04 to people|_|01 . the poor|_|02 were n't able|_|03 to go|_|03 to work|_|03 because they had to stand|_|03 in line|_|01 at at ms.|_|05 someone|_|01 made|_|08 a really|_|01 good|_|20 point|_|09 that the real|_|04 money|_|03 from corruption|_|05 is stored|_|01 in swiss|_|01 banks|_|02 . i agree|_|01 !
reading|_|06 about issues|_|01 happening|_|04 across|_|02 the world|_|08 seems|_|04 foreign|_|02 , but just think|_|01 : any trouble|_|03 anywhere|_|01 in the world|_|08 , the us|_|01 is usually|_|01 involved|_|01 . i think|_|01 any conflict|_|06 and abuses|_|01 of power|_|01 in any nation|_|04 in the world|_|08 , especially|_|01 in the middle|_|04 east|_|03 , can spell|_|02 disaster|_|03 for the people|_|01 in the us|_|01 . we ca|_|01 n't really|_|01 ignore|_|04 issues|_|01 that happen|_|04 far|_|04 away|_|10 because ultimately|_|01 as a nation|_|04 , we will have to face|_|03 the consequences|_|01 , either|_|01 by sending|_|02 our troops|_|04 or any other effects|_|01 .
as someone|_|01 who works|_|27 in health|_|02 care|_|06 i have not encountered|_|11 this type|_|01 of thing|_|08 yet|_|01 , but everyone has an embarrassing|_|01 story|_|01 and while the er|_|01 may|_|01 have not seen|_|01 the exact|_|01 same thing|_|08 , they 've likely|_|01 seen|_|01 crazier|_|03 , just own it and go|_|01 in . you can always|_|02 tell|_|03 people|_|01 about your own embarrassing|_|01 experience|_|02 in third|_|01 person|_|01 , much|_|04 better|_|18 than losing|_|06 a limb|_|05 , organ|_|05 or your life|_|08 .
" i just read|_|06 an article|_|04 about keisha and how she was pressured|_|01 into losing|_|11 weight|_|05 by not eating|_|02 and " " numbing|_|01 down " " the content|_|02 of her songs|_|01 . it 's pretty|_|01 messed|_|01 up that this is what goes|_|03 on in the entertainment|_|01 / music|_|05 industry|_|02 . at the same time|_|04 though|_|01 , she is an adult|_|02 and she had the choice|_|02 to go|_|03 along|_|03 with this or not . she cashed|_|01 in and got|_|01 a lot|_|05 of fame|_|02 . i ca|_|01 n't say|_|01 i really|_|01 feel|_|05 that sorry|_|01 for her . if it was me i would have just said|_|01 , " " no " " and moved|_|02 on . she had the ability|_|02 to speak|_|02 up , but she did n't because she wanted|_|01 fame|_|02 . "
i was reading|_|06 about a few people|_|03 that were killed|_|01 as a result|_|03 of typhoon|_|01 meantime|_|01 . i think|_|03 it 's fortunate|_|02 that not too many|_|01 people|_|03 were killed|_|01 during this storm|_|03 . it seems|_|02 like|_|02 people|_|03 have generally|_|02 gotten|_|01 better|_|07 about heeding|_|01 warnings|_|04 about these powerful|_|01 storms|_|03 . however|_|03 , it seems|_|02 like|_|02 infrastructure|_|02 damage|_|02 is something that needs|_|02 to be analyzed|_|04 .
this sounds|_|02 like|_|02 such a freak|_|01 thing|_|08 . it must|_|01 be so hard|_|08 for the family|_|06 because there are no answers|_|02 and they need|_|01 answers|_|02 . i 'm not sure|_|07 this is something that is easy|_|03 to figure|_|01 out . it sounds|_|02 like|_|02 a severe|_|02 case|_|04 of pneumonia|_|01 , but from what , how and why . and the fluid|_|02 on the brain|_|01 of the one|_|01 sister|_|03 is so strange|_|02 . i would think|_|05 they would know|_|04 more after the autopsies|_|01 , and i do n't understand|_|02 why that is taking|_|05 so long|_|01 . i 'm thinking|_|05 that the family|_|06 wants|_|01 to bring|_|04 the bodies|_|01 back|_|06 to the states|_|06 and that could be holding|_|05 up the autopsies|_|01 .
what this article|_|02 taught|_|02 me was that heartbreaks|_|01 are not the end|_|05 of the world|_|01 . yes|_|01 , they are not . just because that one|_|05 precious|_|02 person|_|01 left|_|01 us|_|01 we start|_|07 living|_|02 with an emotion|_|01 that our life|_|03 has come|_|01 to an end|_|05 . life|_|03 is n't ending|_|02 at all , each day|_|01 is a new|_|01 beginning|_|01 , with new|_|01 people|_|01 waiting|_|02 for us|_|01 out there . as you move|_|01 forward|_|01 , life|_|03 will remove|_|01 many|_|01 people|_|01 from your life|_|03 just because they are n't required|_|04 and you can actually|_|02 reach|_|03 your destination|_|04 . your life|_|03 has just begun|_|07 , nobody|_|04 stops|_|01 moving|_|01 , the sun|_|01 still|_|04 rises|_|08 and the sun|_|01 still|_|04 sets|_|10 .
i just read|_|06 an article|_|02 where there was a horrible|_|03 natural|_|07 disaster|_|03 . they were saying|_|01 how the town|_|02 is a virtual|_|02 ghost|_|01 town|_|02 and workers|_|02 were n't allowed|_|01 to go|_|03 back|_|06 until they check|_|01 the building|_|07 further|_|05 . could you imagine|_|02 what it would be like|_|02 to be one|_|01 of those people|_|01 , i mean|_|04 to lose|_|06 everything you have ? things|_|08 you 've worked|_|03 so hard|_|01 to squire|_|01 just gone|_|03 ? and god|_|03 forbid|_|01 a loved|_|01 one|_|01 ? i do n't even|_|01 know|_|04 how you would begin|_|09 to process|_|05 all of this .
i 'm just in shock|_|07 at what i read|_|03 . all these migrants|_|01 attempting|_|01 to make|_|01 a better|_|13 life|_|01 for themselves ironically|_|01 met|_|05 an untimely|_|03 and unexpected|_|01 end|_|10 . we must|_|01 think|_|09 about all these poor|_|02 people|_|01 who are forced|_|01 to flee|_|01 and find|_|01 better|_|13 lives|_|01 . we must|_|01 learn|_|08 to accept|_|20 them instead|_|01 of having them forced|_|01 to survive|_|02 .
it was a very gruesome|_|01 moment|_|03 it does n't help|_|06 the fact|_|04 that refugees|_|01 face|_|01 an exhaustive|_|01 screening|_|01 process|_|03 by the united|_|03 nations|_|04 high|_|05 commissioner|_|01 for refugees|_|01 that can take|_|01 years|_|03 . it is good|_|13 that when the federal|_|04 government|_|01 and its nonprofit|_|01 partners|_|01 provide|_|06 job|_|02 - search|_|05 help|_|02 and cash|_|03 assistance|_|02 for refugees|_|01 during their first|_|06 months|_|02 in the united|_|03 states|_|04 . after that , they are largely|_|02 on their own . this strategy|_|02 has made|_|08 it hard|_|01 for refugee|_|01 families|_|01 — who often|_|05 come|_|04 to america|_|01 with few assets|_|01 or material|_|03 possessions|_|02 — to move|_|01 up and out of poverty|_|01 , and may|_|01 be contribute|_|08 to younger|_|01 generations|_|01 ’ sense|_|01 of isolation|_|05 , the result|_|02 of struggling|_|03 to find|_|02 their place|_|01 in this country|_|04 . now , earning|_|08 a living|_|06 in the u.s.|_|01 is proving|_|01 difficult|_|01 for younger|_|01 generations|_|01 . donald trump|_|02 ’s crusade|_|02 against immigrants|_|01
so apparently|_|01 even|_|05 turtles|_|01 are poised|_|04 to suffer|_|11 from our careless|_|03 destruction|_|01 of the planet|_|03 bis|_|01 a bis|_|01 degradation|_|01 to habitats|_|01 due|_|01 to climate|_|02 change|_|05 . though|_|01 it seems|_|02 like|_|02 they will be able|_|04 to withstand|_|01 the changes|_|05 in temperature|_|02 , it is not at all clear|_|03 what will be the outcome|_|01 of the potentially|_|01 lost|_|11 habitats|_|01 they live|_|07 in due|_|01 to climate|_|02 change|_|05 . these guys|_|03 have been around|_|01 longer|_|01 than we have , as a species|_|01 . it 's really|_|01 sad|_|02 to think|_|13 that we would be responsible|_|02 for endangering|_|02 them even|_|04 further|_|05 than we already|_|01 have .
i will never|_|02 empathize|_|02 or understand|_|02 racists|_|01 . vandalism|_|01 is the epitome|_|01 of childish|_|01 crimes|_|02 as well|_|09 . it 's the twenty|_|01 - first|_|02 century|_|01 and we still|_|01 are surrounded|_|01 by stupid|_|01 racists|_|01 . i say|_|01 stupid|_|01 because ignorance|_|01 is simply|_|03 not having a lack|_|01 of intelligence|_|01 or something , but you 're still|_|01 willing|_|01 to educate|_|01 yourself or be educated|_|01 on it . stupidity|_|02 is being surrounded|_|01 by so many|_|01 outlets|_|01 , professors|_|01 , libraries|_|05 , internet|_|01 , magazines|_|05 , and still|_|01 refusing|_|05 to learn|_|01 about those that are different|_|02 from you .
man|_|08 , car|_|01 crashes|_|03 happen|_|04 all the time|_|05 . there is no way|_|11 they can be prevented|_|01 . i would like|_|02 to think|_|01 that the smart|_|12 cars|_|01 of the future|_|01 would help|_|05 prevent|_|01 this , but i am not to sure|_|01 . somebody|_|01 could probably|_|01 hack|_|02 those and cause|_|01 massive|_|04 car|_|01 wrecks|_|02 as well|_|09 . people|_|01 should also|_|02 drive|_|12 safer|_|02 as well|_|09 . there is definitely|_|01 too much|_|01 speeding|_|01 . i wonder|_|02 if drunk|_|02 driving|_|08 was the cause|_|02 of the wreck|_|02 . that 's a huge|_|01 problem|_|01 that causes|_|01 a bunch|_|02 of wrecks|_|02 . do n't drink|_|01 and drive|_|12 people|_|01 .
this story|_|03 upsets|_|06 me . i ca|_|01 n't seem|_|04 to get|_|01 it out of my head|_|01 that the victim|_|02 was a child|_|03 even|_|01 though|_|01 there 's conflicting|_|02 comments|_|01 . but to die|_|10 because you stole|_|01 porridge|_|01 seems|_|04 insane|_|01 . i guess|_|02 i ca|_|01 n't put|_|07 myself in that situation|_|01 where maybe|_|01 porridge|_|01 is hard|_|01 to come|_|01 by but just knowing|_|10 that someone|_|01 died|_|10 for that seems|_|04 petty|_|03 to me .

it 's disappointing|_|01 that in this day|_|07 and age|_|01 that homosexuality|_|01 is still|_|04 illegal|_|01 in different|_|01 countries|_|04 . i would think|_|03 that it would be past|_|02 that and that people|_|01 would just get|_|07 over it . it took|_|02 forever|_|02 for america|_|01 to recognize|_|02 gay|_|06 marriage|_|02 so i guess|_|02 it 's not surprising|_|01 that uganda|_|01 has n't yet|_|01 . but i still|_|04 think|_|03 that it 's a breach|_|02 of human|_|03 rights|_|01 and it 's moral|_|01 wrong|_|05
dear|_|04 god|_|01 friend|_|01 , let|_|02 me tell|_|02 you , this is just disgusting|_|02 . poor|_|01 animals|_|01 . we continue|_|02 to damage|_|01 the environment|_|02 and this tug|_|01 boat|_|01 company|_|03 just says|_|01 oh|_|01 my apologies|_|03 and thanks|_|02 for cleaning|_|08 up my mess|_|02 . after they destroyed|_|04 ecological|_|01 habitats|_|01 and caused|_|02 damage|_|02 to almost|_|07 extinct|_|01 species|_|01 . the company|_|03 should be fined|_|03 millions|_|02 of dollars|_|04 and be in some serious|_|01 deep|_|03 water|_|06 no pun|_|01 intended|_|03 . i know|_|01 you agree|_|01 man|_|08 . i hate|_|01 to see|_|12 animals|_|01 hurt|_|02 and just the negligence|_|02 is enough|_|02 to make|_|03 me want|_|01 to go|_|01 out there myself . we need|_|02 to take|_|01 care|_|04 of this planet|_|02 for once effectively|_|01 and i know|_|01 you agree|_|01 with me .
there are a lot|_|05 of things|_|08 in this article|_|04 that i do n't agree|_|01 with . i do n't think|_|02 that being gay|_|01 is a mental|_|05 problem|_|01 , but i do believe|_|01 that it is a sin|_|04 . the only way|_|11 for people|_|03 to stop|_|01 committing|_|18 this sin|_|04 is for god|_|01 to work|_|09 in their lives|_|10 . i do n't know|_|11 a lot|_|05 about conversion|_|04 therapy|_|01 , but i 'm not so sure|_|06 that this is the way|_|11 to go|_|03 . i also|_|02 do n't believe|_|01 that trump|_|01 is anti|_|01 gay|_|01 . he has n't done anything that would make|_|43 him anti|_|01 gay|_|01 .
this is an absolute|_|04 disgrace|_|02 that it still|_|01 happens|_|01 and can happen|_|01 in america|_|01 . how are things|_|05 like|_|04 this still|_|01 happening|_|01 . i get|_|02 that there has always|_|02 been murder|_|01 , and if someone|_|01 is determined|_|08 enough|_|01 they are going|_|02 to find|_|02 a way|_|06 to do this , but for it to happen|_|01 in one|_|05 of the most locked|_|02 down and secured|_|03 places|_|01 is ridiculous|_|03 . i feel|_|05 bad|_|01 for the family|_|06 involved|_|05 and hopefully|_|02 their loss|_|02 will help|_|01 spark|_|04 a positive|_|02 change|_|01 .
oh|_|01 hey , check|_|01 it out . another|_|01 article|_|04 about the same thing|_|08 that 's been repeated|_|01 over and over again , but it 's not really|_|01 changing|_|06 anything . i am just sending|_|02 it to you because i 'm an idiot|_|01 that does n't care|_|02 about what you think|_|01 . it just goes|_|03 on and on about meat|_|01 production|_|08 and how that 's harming|_|01 the environment|_|02 . i ca|_|01 n't wait|_|04 for lab|_|01 grown|_|01 meat|_|01 to be the standard|_|01 , but that 's not really|_|01 in this . so , read|_|06 away|_|01 about cow|_|03 farts|_|01 .
after reading|_|06 this article|_|02 , i had to write|_|03 you and share|_|02 it with you . you see|_|01 , we are n't just crazy|_|05 parents|_|01 telling|_|01 our children|_|02 to slow|_|03 down every|_|01 chance|_|01 we get|_|01 . these young|_|01 men|_|01 were out doing something they absolutely|_|01 loved|_|02 and doing it with their closest|_|01 friends|_|01 , and now they do n't have the opportunity|_|01 to grow|_|01 old|_|01 and continue|_|02 to enjoy|_|02 many|_|01 more things|_|08 to come|_|05 . they were so young|_|01 and had their whole|_|02 lives|_|01 ahead|_|05 of them . i ca|_|01 n't imagine|_|01 how their families|_|08 are feeling|_|05 right|_|01 now . hug|_|02 your little|_|03 ones|_|02 a little|_|03 tighter|_|07 tonight|_|01 .
this is an extremely|_|01 sad|_|02 story|_|02 the civilians|_|01 who lost|_|03 their did nothing|_|01 wrong|_|02 . they did not ask|_|01 for this war|_|04 to come|_|15 to their region|_|05 . they were mere|_|01 victims|_|02 of the misfortune|_|02 of being born|_|10 where they were and being where they were when they were . they were no more guilty|_|02 than you or i. it is extremely|_|01 sad|_|02 and disappoints|_|01 me as an american|_|02 .
it 's a shame|_|02 that there are so many|_|01 refugees|_|01 in the world|_|01 but when does it stop|_|01 becoming|_|03 my responsibility|_|01 . i understand|_|03 that conditions|_|07 around|_|04 the world|_|01 are not ideal|_|02 for everyone . however|_|01 , if we just let|_|01 everyone start|_|07 coming|_|04 here who has a problem|_|01 in the world|_|01 we begin|_|09 to lose|_|01 a sense|_|01 of who we are and what made|_|02 us|_|01 have the country|_|04 that is stable|_|01 . i do n't want|_|05 to sacrifice|_|04 my nation|_|04 completely|_|01 over the fact|_|04 that i 'm sorry|_|01 the place|_|01 you live|_|02 sucks|_|01 and is run|_|11 by morons|_|02 .
you never|_|01 know|_|01 when a disaster|_|01 could strike|_|08 , and often|_|05 it seems|_|02 that they are the most unexpected|_|01 and inopportune|_|01 time|_|03 . it 's especially|_|01 sad|_|02 when you do n't expect|_|04 it . a whole|_|01 family|_|01 was lost|_|07 in flames|_|03 , including|_|01 their family|_|01 pet|_|01 . their house|_|01 was turned|_|10 to rubble|_|01 and ash|_|01 . you should always|_|04 take|_|05 the time|_|03 in your day|_|07 to appreciate|_|01 everything that you have because you never|_|01 know|_|01 what could happen|_|01 at any moment|_|02 . make|_|01 sure|_|07 to always|_|04 be appreciative|_|02 and caring|_|02 .
" first|_|01 of all , i guess|_|02 i 'm being too naive|_|01 in my thinking|_|01 that the kkk|_|01 no longer|_|01 existed|_|02 . also|_|02 , i can not see|_|17 that this had anything to do with trump|_|02 , himself , but more some radical|_|01 group|_|02 trying|_|01 to tie|_|08 themselves to the trump|_|02 campaign|_|01 to make|_|07 him look|_|02 bad|_|01 . i would not be surprised|_|01 if this was " " fake|_|02 news|_|01 " " drummed|_|01 up by the democratic|_|02 party|_|05 in order|_|13 to smear|_|02 trump|_|02 . "
this whole|_|01 story|_|02 of all the thirty|_|01 three|_|02 miners|_|01 found|_|01 dead|_|01 is an unfortunate|_|01 tragedy|_|01 . their loss|_|02 is really|_|01 going|_|05 to affect|_|01 their family|_|08 , friends|_|03 , and co|_|01 workers|_|01 for the company|_|01 that they work|_|01 for to . these type|_|06 of losses|_|02 could have been avoided|_|01 if they received|_|05 more help|_|01 or they could have trained|_|01 them more for encase|_|01 any unexpected|_|01 events|_|03 that could occur|_|02 like|_|02 this one|_|01 for example|_|04 .
i just read|_|06 about the elephants|_|02 being killed|_|01 for their ivory|_|01 . it is such a sad|_|02 thing|_|08 that these elephants|_|02 ca|_|01 n't be protected|_|02 by all nations|_|04 . i think|_|01 we should try|_|01 to do more . maybe|_|01 do some research|_|01 and see|_|01 if we can help|_|01 . i would sure|_|01 hate|_|01 to see|_|01 elephants|_|02 disappear|_|01 and that is the way|_|11 things|_|08 are going|_|03 right|_|01 now . it would be a shame|_|02 to lose|_|06 these beautiful|_|02 animals|_|01 , just because of ivory|_|01 .
man|_|08 , font|_|01 you just worry|_|06 sometimes|_|01 about how we got|_|01 here ? its like|_|02 i always|_|05 knew|_|01 this country|_|04 which i love|_|01 so much|_|01 , was uncover|_|02 still|_|01 the most raciest|_|04 place|_|13 . the win|_|01 of trump|_|02 just made|_|08 it so much|_|05 easier|_|03 for all his|_|01 ignorant|_|01 like|_|02 mined|_|01 follows|_|19 to treat|_|05 people|_|01 of color|_|01 and some women|_|02 , not at there equal|_|01 , but as people|_|01 who font|_|01 matter|_|02 . its sickens|_|04 me to think|_|03 about all they have done to people|_|01 of color|_|01 the most . its like|_|02 we are in 1960 again .
i think|_|09 the girl|_|01 may|_|01 be as spy|_|01 for another|_|01 country|_|04 . she sells|_|02 the important|_|05 information|_|01 to another|_|01 government|_|02 . it may|_|01 be leads|_|09 to sever|_|01 problem|_|01 to the pakistan|_|01 government|_|02 . so , the police|_|01 action|_|01 is correct|_|05 . the police|_|01 must|_|01 be gathered|_|04 from the girl|_|01 . first|_|02 thing|_|02 is the girl|_|01 did not the authorized|_|01 person|_|03 for enter|_|02 this office|_|03 . this is the first|_|02 criminal|_|01 activity|_|01 . she theft|_|01 the important|_|05 information|_|01 from the office|_|03 . this is the severe|_|06 criminal|_|01 activity|_|01 . so , the girl|_|01 must|_|01 be punished|_|01 severe|_|06 . this is the big|_|02 problem|_|01 for the government|_|02 .
positions|_|01 of power|_|04 will always|_|04 , inevitably|_|01 be taken|_|02 over by a corrupt|_|01 and greedy|_|01 type|_|03 of individual|_|01 or group|_|01 of people|_|01 . any time|_|06 you have a person|_|01 who has authority|_|03 over another|_|01 person|_|01 , eventually|_|01 things|_|09 will go|_|01 bad|_|13 . whether it 's kings|_|07 demanding|_|01 that they get|_|01 to deflower|_|01 any bride|_|03 before her wedding|_|03 day|_|10 ( as a law|_|01 ) or our own united|_|05 states|_|03 government|_|02 attempting|_|01 to strip|_|03 more and more freedoms|_|01 from us|_|01 when we 're already|_|01 slaves|_|01 ... these are the acts|_|02 of corruption|_|01 . these are the acts|_|02 of cowardice|_|01 , scum|_|02 - bag|_|02 gangsters|_|01 that wear|_|09 suits|_|01 .
i think|_|03 its so scary|_|01 that there have been shark|_|02 attacks|_|05 in australia|_|02 's beaches|_|01 . i would n't want|_|05 to be a surfer|_|01 there knowing|_|01 that anytime my life|_|03 could be in danger|_|02 since you do n't know|_|01 what your surfing|_|01 under whether its a huge|_|01 shark|_|03 preying|_|02 on you waiting|_|04 to strike|_|04 and make|_|03 you his|_|01 fresh|_|12 meal|_|03 . i am always|_|04 cautious|_|01 when i 'm in the water|_|06 since people|_|01 do n't realize|_|08 there are so many|_|01 dangers|_|02 deciding|_|03 to get|_|01 into the water|_|06 .
so i just read|_|05 this article|_|04 about rappers|_|01 and music|_|05 artists|_|01 having a disagreement|_|01 . it was pretty|_|01 stupid|_|01 too , i do n't get|_|01 why adults|_|01 are fighting|_|02 like|_|02 high|_|02 school|_|05 children|_|03 . it was all over some petty|_|03 comments|_|01 made|_|02 , which apparently|_|01 turned|_|10 to racist|_|02 slurs|_|02 and got|_|01 someone|_|01 thrown|_|03 out few a building|_|01 . of course|_|04 , everything is he said|_|01 she said|_|01 so i ca|_|01 n't tell|_|01 who was really|_|01 wrong|_|01 in this situation|_|03 . however|_|01 , again another|_|01 situation|_|03 that shows|_|08 the stupidity|_|02 of the human|_|03 race|_|03 .
see|_|03 what i told|_|01 ya ! if kids|_|01 are bored|_|02 they will eventually|_|01 be up to no good|_|13 . here is this man|_|10 just minding|_|02 his|_|01 own business|_|06 and he 's attacked|_|05 by a bunch|_|02 of teens|_|01 on bikes|_|01 ! the kid|_|01 that threatened|_|02 him with the bottle|_|03 was probably|_|01 just trying|_|01 to show|_|08 off to his|_|01 friends|_|01 . i mean|_|04 , this did happen|_|01 in scotland|_|01 but it would 've been right|_|01 in our backyards|_|01 as well|_|01 . i think|_|03 we really|_|01 need|_|03 to rethink|_|01 our commitment|_|01 to the youth|_|01 center|_|02 . i firmly|_|01 believe|_|01 that when kids|_|01 have a place|_|02 to go|_|04 and things|_|01 to do , they are less|_|02 inclined|_|01 to get|_|24 caught|_|24 up in this kind|_|01 of mischief|_|01 !

polar|_|04 bears|_|02 deserve|_|01 the respect|_|03 they deserve|_|01 . they do not deserve|_|01 to be treated|_|08 the way|_|10 they are now . there 's no reason|_|02 to kill|_|14 these animals|_|01 and it disgusts|_|02 me that humans|_|02 exist|_|02 just to cause|_|02 harm|_|01 to them . i hope|_|03 one|_|05 day|_|01 there 's a collective|_|03 effort|_|02 to stop|_|05 the growing|_|04 genocide|_|01 of these gentle|_|01 and humble|_|03 creatures|_|02 .

the situation|_|03 in syria|_|01 is really|_|01 shocking|_|06 . i just read|_|03 an article|_|04 about how the regime|_|01 in power|_|02 together|_|01 with russia|_|01 is bombing|_|07 schools|_|05 and relief|_|01 caravans|_|01 . they deny|_|03 it and russia|_|01 and china|_|01 vote|_|01 against sanctions|_|04 at the un|_|01 . it 's hard|_|01 to understand|_|01 what could be behind|_|01 this outrage|_|02 . fortunately|_|01 , there is human|_|02 rights|_|01 watch|_|04 which has done extensive|_|01 and careful|_|01 documentation|_|01 of the most recent|_|01 school|_|05 bombing|_|02 , and there is some effort|_|02 to get|_|24 individual|_|04 acts|_|02 treated|_|03 as war|_|04 crimes|_|02 through un|_|01 channels|_|01 .

this article|_|04 is fascinating|_|01 - takes|_|02 the concept|_|01 of global|_|01 warming|_|10 and directly|_|01 ties|_|09 it with the impact|_|02 on weather|_|01 events|_|01 . these events|_|01 show|_|01 a vast|_|01 contrast|_|02 between both extremely|_|02 hot|_|17 weather|_|01 and also|_|02 extreme|_|02 amounts|_|02 of precipitation|_|03 when compared|_|04 across|_|02 historical|_|02 items|_|01 . showing|_|01 it is not just a regionally|_|01 focused|_|03 weather|_|01 pattern|_|01 , but in fact|_|01 across|_|02 the country|_|04 that is the most troubling|_|01 .

well|_|01 first|_|03 of all whoever wrote|_|01 this article|_|04 does n't know|_|01 how to properly|_|01 divide|_|07 an article|_|04 into paragraphs|_|01 , which made|_|43 reading|_|04 this article|_|04 extremely|_|01 painful|_|01 , but nonetheless|_|01 i do know|_|01 after reading|_|03 the article|_|04 that erika virus|_|03 tend|_|03 to stay|_|03 in semen|_|01 and vaginal|_|01 fluid|_|02 for extended|_|03 amount|_|02 of time|_|01 , so it 's obvious|_|01 do n't mate|_|03 with people|_|03 who have erika virus|_|03 , and do n't even|_|01 think|_|01 about having a baby|_|03 , they 're going|_|03 to be defective|_|14
the story|_|03 about a woman|_|02 theta|_|01 was thinking|_|01 of places|_|01 she had been before and the terrorist|_|01 attacks|_|05 that had taken|_|01 place|_|01 . the thought|_|01 of being in a place|_|01 and having to worry|_|01 about someone|_|01 trying|_|01 to shoot|_|01 or inflict|_|01 harm|_|03 upon others is disheartening|_|01 and makes|_|27 me not want|_|05 to go|_|04 out in public|_|02 anymore|_|01 for fear|_|03 of my life|_|03 .
poor|_|01 woman|_|02 ! i hope|_|03 that she is able|_|01 to recover|_|04 . i hate|_|01 to hear|_|02 of anyone being in an accident|_|02 . i see|_|01 that there were three|_|02 cars|_|02 involved|_|05 . i wonder|_|03 if she was the other one|_|06 critically|_|01 injured|_|01 . i guess|_|02 if there were were at least|_|01 three|_|02 people|_|01 involved|_|05 and only one|_|06 was seriously|_|01 injured|_|01 , those are n't the worst|_|09 odds|_|02 .
i am torn|_|02 when it comes|_|20 to this one|_|01 . i feel|_|05 bad|_|01 because that is a horrible|_|03 way|_|11 to die|_|04 and his|_|01 sister|_|03 definitely|_|01 did not need|_|02 to see|_|02 that . but i also|_|02 do not understand|_|02 why they would be so careless|_|01 and wander|_|01 off on a trail|_|01 where it is clearly|_|01 marked|_|05 that they should n't be leaving|_|12 . if they would have paid|_|05 more attention|_|01 and dint|_|01 carelessly|_|01 not listen|_|02 to rules|_|09 than this situation|_|01 could have been avoided|_|01 .

we should really|_|01 do more for our veterans|_|03 who come|_|04 back|_|04 with traumatic|_|02 experiences|_|03 . they do so much|_|05 for the country|_|04 , but they barely|_|01 get|_|08 the care|_|01 they need|_|02 when they come|_|04 back|_|04 . how rude|_|01 of our president|_|02 to make|_|08 little|_|08 of their situation|_|02 . he has never|_|02 and will never|_|02 be their own shoes|_|02 . he grew|_|01 up with a silver|_|01 spoon|_|02 in his|_|01 mouth|_|01 with no pity|_|02 for anyone .
this is a completely|_|01 unacceptable|_|04 situation|_|03 . our military|_|03 bombs|_|05 a doctors|_|01 without borders|_|03 medical|_|02 facility|_|05 and they have the gall|_|01 to point|_|14 their fingers|_|03 at those who were bombed|_|07 . and the only restitution|_|03 they offer|_|02 is a promise|_|02 to keep|_|04 bombing|_|02 and carrying|_|33 on just like|_|02 they were until the mission|_|02 is completed|_|02 . revolting|_|01 .
people|_|01 are still|_|01 talking|_|05 about hillary|_|01 clinton|_|02 .... which is sooooooooo old|_|01 news|_|01 ... she lost|_|08 fair|_|01 and square|_|06 and people|_|01 just need|_|02 to get|_|02 over it ....... she lost|_|08 to trump|_|01 , which means|_|04 we definitely|_|01 did n't want|_|02 her as our president|_|01 . she and everyone else|_|03 needs|_|02 to stop|_|03 blaming|_|02 everything and everyone else|_|03 ......... lets|_|02 all just do each other a favor|_|01 and just pretend|_|07 she never|_|02 happened|_|03 and just let|_|01 her retire|_|07 in silence|_|02 .

no need|_|01 to read|_|08 this article|_|04 for my fellow|_|06 animal|_|01 lovers|_|01 . its just sad|_|01 and kinda|_|02 infuriating|_|01 . people|_|03 are just worthless|_|01 shits|_|01 . there really|_|01 inst|_|02 much|_|04 else|_|03 to say|_|11 about this . it was a preventable|_|01 accident|_|02 that dint|_|01 have to happen|_|04 but did anyway|_|02 because of people|_|03 's thoughtlessness|_|01 and carelessness|_|01 and probably|_|01 for fucking|_|01 financial|_|01 reasons|_|02 as well|_|12 .
here 's an article|_|04 about standing|_|03 rock|_|02 that i thought|_|02 you would like|_|02 to read|_|08 . i think|_|02 it 's a few years|_|03 old|_|01 because it says|_|01 the protests|_|01 have been going|_|02 on for five|_|01 months|_|02 , and i started|_|09 following|_|04 the standing|_|03 rock|_|02 case|_|11 a lot|_|05 longer|_|01 than five|_|01 months|_|02 ago|_|01 . barack obama was still|_|01 president|_|02 then . i am very disappointed|_|02 in the way|_|05 he handled|_|01 it and of course|_|09 i have zero|_|01 hope|_|02 that trump|_|02 will do right|_|01 by native|_|03 americans|_|03 at standing|_|03 rock|_|02 or anywhere|_|01 else|_|03 . we 've had our own pipeline|_|02 leaks|_|05 here in michigan|_|03 , so the lakota|_|01 and sioux|_|01 who live|_|01 in that area|_|01 are right|_|03 to be concerned|_|02 . even|_|03 more so , it 's their land|_|02 and they have a right|_|03 to tell|_|01 the oil|_|01 companies|_|03 no way|_|05 .
so apparently|_|01 sea|_|02 ice|_|01 is becoming|_|02 less|_|02 and less|_|02 which is a concern|_|03 four|_|01 our environment|_|02 and all i can think|_|11 of is how it will affect|_|01 the animals|_|01 in the ocean|_|02 . this can not be good|_|01 for the ecosystem|_|01 . or is it ? in contrast|_|04 to the article|_|04 , i remember|_|02 seeing|_|17 a whale|_|02 die|_|01 because the ice|_|01 was so thick|_|10 and they were trapped|_|04 . perhaps|_|01 neither|_|01 are good|_|01 , but how do we fix|_|02 this ?
wow|_|02 , did you guys|_|01 hear|_|02 anything about this ? it would be cool|_|06 if men|_|01 could take|_|35 birth|_|01 control|_|02 as well|_|01 . not just to relieve|_|11 the burden|_|01 from women|_|02 , but for men|_|01 to have their own sexual|_|04 freedom|_|01 as well|_|01 . condoms|_|01 are really|_|01 the only thing|_|08 they have control|_|04 over , and they 're known|_|01 to fail|_|11 more often|_|03 than any form|_|01 of birth|_|01 control|_|02 .

this article|_|04 held|_|01 some very valid|_|02 views|_|03 that i have been trying|_|01 to explain|_|02 for years|_|06 . the hypocrisy|_|02 that america|_|01 generates|_|04 is overwhelming|_|02 and others can see|_|05 this too . we are holding|_|01 ourselves so high|_|01 up as a free|_|06 country|_|04 meanwhile|_|02 a black|_|13 man|_|10 can not even|_|04 get|_|02 pulled|_|17 over without having a white|_|07 man|_|10 pulling|_|17 a gun|_|01 on him .
corals|_|04 around|_|01 the world|_|08 are dying|_|04 and especially|_|01 corals|_|04 in the great|_|01 barrier|_|03 reef|_|01 . factors|_|01 that contributed|_|08 are the increase|_|03 of temperature|_|02 due|_|02 to global|_|01 warming|_|03 and humans|_|02 destroying|_|04 them . the articled|_|01 stated|_|02 that half|_|01 of the great|_|01 barrier|_|03 reef|_|01 corals|_|04 are now dead|_|06 from 2016 - 2017 . that 's only a year|_|03 . imagine|_|02 swimming|_|01 with no corals|_|04 , no corals|_|04 means|_|04 no fish|_|02 ecosystem|_|01 to look|_|02 at .

i am very concerned|_|01 about the spread|_|08 of erika . i think|_|03 in many|_|01 cases|_|05 the federal|_|01 government|_|02 takes|_|35 it too likely|_|01 . what price|_|03 is too expensive|_|01 for the health|_|02 and safety|_|06 of our citizens|_|01 , especially|_|01 our most vulnerable|_|03 ones|_|02 . given|_|04 the advance|_|03 warning|_|04 we’be had about the dangers|_|02 and progression|_|03 of erika , it is shameful|_|01 the lack|_|01 of progress|_|03 that has been made|_|03 globally|_|01 .
i feel|_|05 sad|_|02 when reading|_|06 this story|_|02 , as she lost|_|01 her companion|_|03 and that 's just what some animals|_|01 are to people|_|01 their companion|_|03 , not just a dog|_|01 or a pet|_|01 , it 's a part|_|01 of them . this man|_|08 was wrong|_|01 for what he did although he was justified|_|05 because it was seen|_|05 as self|_|02 defense|_|01 he definitely|_|01 could have done something else|_|03 before fatally|_|01 shooting|_|03 the dog|_|01 and killing|_|01 it . unless the dog|_|01 was charging|_|03 at him and starting|_|08 to bite|_|02 him or bark|_|04 at him he should have seen|_|05 no threat|_|03 at that time|_|02 and i feel|_|05 like|_|02 this was a careless|_|01 mistake|_|02 and he did n't need|_|03 to do so .
this is just something better|_|01 to know|_|03 . i am not a person|_|01 who really|_|01 alert|_|02 about what is going|_|02 on around|_|02 . i never|_|02 heard|_|02 about this . i do not really|_|01 have any comments|_|01 . just want|_|05 today|_|02 that it is good|_|13 to find|_|02 a way|_|01 to save|_|09 money|_|03 . if you could , you can transfer|_|06 this article|_|04 's to whose who will find|_|02 them useful|_|01 .
while i was reading|_|06 the article|_|02 , i found|_|05 myself not feeling|_|05 warm|_|09 or sympathetic|_|02 . i guess|_|02 i just do not care|_|01 , to be frank|_|03 , about the things|_|12 happening|_|02 in haiti|_|01 . i do n't think|_|02 others care|_|01 either|_|01 . that 's where a lot|_|05 of my focus|_|03 was , thinking|_|02 about how others do n't care|_|01 . i think|_|02 for the most part|_|01 , people|_|01 do n't generally|_|02 care|_|01 about what is happening|_|02 in other countries|_|04 . i think|_|02 haiti|_|01 is one|_|01 of them . i think|_|02 people|_|01 have just been forced|_|06 to care|_|01 . anyway|_|01 , as i said|_|01 , i do n't care|_|01 about haiti|_|01 .
hopefully|_|02 you did not go|_|05 through much|_|04 reading|_|06 this particular|_|02 message|_|02 unfortunately|_|01 this happens|_|01 everyday|_|01 and people|_|01 throw|_|06 blind|_|02 eyes|_|05 tor|_|02 the situation|_|01 because no one|_|01 wants|_|01 to deal|_|04 with this kind|_|01 of stuff|_|01 but i am presenting|_|01 this tough|_|01 to you so you guys|_|01 can acknowledge|_|04 it and be aware|_|01 of it and be a little|_|01 more bit|_|04 educated|_|01 about stuff|_|01 like|_|02 this and so on
it is awful|_|02 that there is such turmoil|_|02 in the middle|_|03 east|_|05 . it makes|_|43 me so grateful|_|02 that i am an american|_|01 . is n't it sad|_|02 that doctors|_|01 without borders|_|01 is at risk|_|02 because of the fighting|_|05 in the middle|_|03 east|_|05 . those people|_|01 donate|_|01 their time|_|04 to help|_|01 others and they have to worry|_|06 if they are going|_|03 to be hurt|_|02 or killed|_|10 . such a sad|_|02 area|_|01 of the world|_|08 .
" this ticks|_|02 me off for two|_|01 reasons|_|03 : one|_|01 , that we 've messed|_|02 up the australian|_|01 ecosystem|_|01 so badly|_|01 , and two|_|01 , that people|_|01 are going|_|03 to read|_|06 it and say|_|01 " " oh|_|01 , no , it was n't climate|_|01 change|_|01 at all , so we do n't have to do anything to fix|_|02 it .

what i learned|_|01 about nature|_|03 is that they can not be predicted|_|01 . nature|_|03 can look|_|07 beautiful|_|02 in one|_|05 instance|_|01 and can kill|_|09 you in the next|_|03 . take|_|01 a look|_|02 at this shark|_|03 incident|_|02 . poor|_|03 guy|_|03 was play|_|16 a game|_|11 with some buddies|_|01 and lost|_|01 his|_|01 life|_|02 for no reason|_|06 . today|_|02 you are here and tomorrow|_|01 you are gone|_|01 . try|_|01 to live|_|01 as long|_|01 as you possibly|_|01 can before some shit|_|04 comes|_|04 along|_|04 and tries|_|01 to take|_|01 it away|_|02 .
since many|_|01 of you guys|_|03 are at the age|_|01 of having children|_|01 , i thought|_|01 this would be something that is important|_|01 to share|_|02 . there is a virus|_|03 called|_|01 cm|_|01 i just read|_|06 about that is causing|_|02 devastating|_|01 consequences|_|03 in newborns|_|01 . these children|_|01 are being born|_|01 with brain|_|01 problems|_|01 , hearing|_|02 problems|_|01 , and learning|_|02 problems|_|01 because the mothers|_|01 are n't being told|_|01 how to prevent|_|02 it . make|_|03 sure|_|08 that you wash|_|06 your hands|_|01 after being around|_|04 toddlers|_|01 , especially|_|01 if you 're pregnant|_|01 !

i feel|_|13 horrible|_|03 that this is happening|_|04 . it probably|_|01 a lot|_|05 to do with what america|_|01 has done in that country|_|04 . they are the ones|_|02 who armed|_|02 the rebels|_|01 and caused|_|01 this problem|_|01 . america|_|01 created|_|03 the terrorists|_|01 groups|_|03 . i know|_|05 i am not responsible|_|02 but it makes|_|03 me sick|_|01 to know|_|05 that intelligence|_|02 agencies|_|01 from our own countries|_|04 instigated|_|02 this problem|_|01 . i feel|_|13 sympathy|_|03 for all those who have been killed|_|14 and the families|_|06 who 's lives|_|01 have been ruined|_|04 .
this does n't sound|_|02 too worrisome|_|01 to me . if you are affected|_|02 by depression|_|01 , then you should decide|_|01 as an individual|_|01 to find|_|04 another|_|01 option|_|02 . it 's just a side|_|10 effect|_|02 , i think|_|02 there are many|_|01 medicines|_|02 out there that have depression|_|01 as a side|_|10 effect|_|02 . it is something that individuals|_|01 should be aware|_|01 of , but nothing|_|01 critical|_|01 .

muslim|_|01 immigration|_|01 seems|_|02 to have some unique|_|06 issues|_|02 . i think|_|01 the solution|_|02 is to hold|_|23 off with allowing|_|01 much|_|01 muslim|_|01 immigration|_|01 until muslims|_|01 start|_|10 polling|_|01 better|_|13 on ideas|_|01 involving|_|07 apostates|_|01 , etc . as evidenced|_|02 by polls|_|01 ( even|_|03 in european|_|01 countries|_|02 ) , the ideas|_|01 muslims|_|01 accept|_|04 put|_|02 them at odds|_|01 with basic|_|03 educational|_|02 values|_|03 . i think|_|01 seeking|_|01 a professional|_|05 to talk|_|02 and try|_|01 to fix|_|02 mental|_|01 issues|_|02 can be a good|_|13 thing|_|01 . the right|_|08 therapy|_|01 can likely|_|01 help|_|06 certain|_|01 people|_|01 . what concerns|_|02 me is living|_|05 situations|_|01 that are unhealthy|_|01 for economic|_|04 reasons|_|01 , and psychological|_|01 problems|_|02 concerning|_|02 motivation|_|01 . i suspect|_|03 some mental|_|01 issues|_|02 may|_|01 not be helped|_|06 by seeing|_|05 a professional|_|05 .

i just read|_|06 an article|_|04 about wells|_|04 fargo|_|01 in particular|_|04 , but really|_|01 it 's probably|_|01 happening|_|01 at many|_|01 banks|_|01 . i know|_|01 you 've seen|_|02 the people|_|01 when you 're out in public|_|02 who are trying|_|01 to get|_|01 you to open|_|06 a new|_|01 account|_|05 and you know|_|01 they 're just doing it to make|_|02 some sort|_|04 of commission|_|04 . well|_|03 , come|_|04 to find|_|10 out wells|_|04 fargo|_|01 just discovered|_|02 80,000 phony|_|01 accounts|_|05 that must|_|01 have been opened|_|06 to fulfill|_|01 branch|_|01 quotas|_|03 . are n't these the institutions|_|02 wee|_|49 supposed|_|02 to trust|_|06 with our money|_|03 ! i understand|_|01 they do n't think|_|02 it 's a big|_|11 deal|_|02 because out of millions|_|02 it was only 80,000 , but i find|_|10 it extremely|_|01 concerning|_|02 that the higher|_|01 ups|_|01 down know|_|01 what 's really|_|01 happening|_|01 in day|_|07 to day|_|07 operations|_|03 . it took|_|06 5|_|01 years|_|03 to discover|_|02 this . what else|_|03 could be happening|_|01 that we do n't know|_|01 about ? !
i think|_|10 this situation|_|03 will more or less|_|01 quickly|_|01 be resolved|_|02 . it is just a temporary|_|07 issue|_|02 and i really|_|01 believe|_|01 the gas|_|01 prices|_|03 will go|_|03 back|_|06 to normal|_|04 . i do n't think|_|10 there should be too much|_|01 to worry|_|06 about . i remember|_|01 this happened|_|04 around|_|02 the crisis|_|01 here back|_|06 in 2009 and everything was settled|_|08 rather|_|01 quickly|_|01 .
hey i was just reading|_|03 an article|_|04 about a teacher|_|02 bashing|_|01 president|_|02 trump|_|02 . you know|_|01 my position|_|01 when it comes|_|04 to trump|_|04 , you know|_|01 i dislike|_|01 the man|_|03 and all ; however|_|01 , i do not believe|_|05 a teacher|_|02 can use|_|04 his|_|01 position|_|01 to bash|_|01 someone|_|01 especially|_|01 on school|_|05 grounds|_|02 . i believe|_|05 he can state|_|04 his|_|01 opinion|_|04 , but not disguise|_|01 it as the truth|_|05 . that could be very dangerous|_|02 .
i just read|_|10 an article|_|02 about the presidential|_|02 campaign|_|01 trail|_|02 that focused|_|02 on how sexist|_|01 one|_|02 of the candidates|_|02 is . it 's important|_|01 that these issues|_|02 are brought|_|11 up , especially|_|01 when it 's on a national|_|06 stage|_|01 like|_|02 this . i 'm glad|_|01 to hear|_|02 people|_|03 are publicly|_|02 voicing|_|01 their concerns|_|01 and even|_|01 revealing|_|02 the troubling|_|01 incidents|_|02 they went|_|01 through involving|_|01 sexism|_|01 . i hope|_|03 after this political|_|02 race|_|03 is over , we can all reflect|_|01 and learn|_|04 to treat|_|01 each other better|_|01 .
" interesting|_|03 article|_|02 , and i can see|_|01 both sides|_|01 of the issue|_|02 . on one|_|01 hand|_|07 , it is true|_|09 that it 's incredibly|_|01 , incredibly|_|01 hard|_|01 for people|_|01 to immigrate|_|03 to america|_|01 . the old|_|02 saying|_|01 that you " " need|_|03 money|_|03 to make|_|43 money|_|03 " " is true|_|09 in the sense|_|01 that if you show|_|08 up on our shores|_|02 with nothing|_|01 at all , it 's going|_|04 to be awfully|_|02 hard|_|01 to make|_|43 anything of yourself . that being said|_|01 , the american|_|01 dream|_|05 has always|_|02 been one|_|01 of pulling|_|17 yourself up by the bootstraps|_|01 and being a self|_|02 - made|_|43 - man|_|08 . you need|_|03 to be able|_|04 to do things|_|07 on your own and most of the most successful|_|01 people|_|01 on earth|_|04 came|_|04 from abject|_|04 poverty|_|01 .

i think|_|13 the article|_|04 is a bit|_|04 hard|_|01 to read|_|03 . it is about the environment|_|02 and e|_|04 nina|_|01 and how they interact|_|01 . the article|_|04 was also|_|02 about pollution|_|01 and how the environment|_|02 is changed|_|01 by certain|_|01 chemicals|_|01 in the air|_|01 . because it 's a science|_|02 based|_|01 article|_|04 , it 's a little|_|01 hard|_|01 to understand|_|03 what the conclusion|_|05 is .
i just read|_|06 an article|_|04 discussing|_|02 the impact|_|02 global|_|01 warming|_|02 is having on polar|_|01 bears|_|02 . it 's really|_|01 troubling|_|02 to read|_|06 about just how much|_|01 damage|_|02 is being done , and you know|_|10 that nobody|_|04 is going|_|03 to do anything about it for years|_|03 here . we have a man|_|01 - child|_|02 president|_|04 , and while the majority|_|01 of the biggest|_|12 countries|_|04 are trying|_|01 to make|_|02 policy|_|03 changes|_|01 to fight|_|03 global|_|01 warming|_|02 , our president|_|04 is dismantling|_|02 our e.p.a organization|_|05 , and putting|_|04 idiots|_|01 that do n't give|_|01 two|_|01 craps|_|01 about the environment|_|02 in charge|_|03 . so when can we expect|_|04 polar|_|01 bears|_|02 to go|_|03 extinct|_|03 ? because you know|_|10 by the time|_|01 we get|_|02 around|_|04 to helping|_|08 them , it 'll be too late|_|01 . the older|_|01 , conservative|_|01 generation|_|03 just needs|_|02 to go|_|03 . anyways|_|01 , you should really|_|01 read|_|06 this article|_|04 . i told|_|01 you this was an issue|_|01 that needed|_|02 to be addressed|_|03 , so go|_|01 read|_|06 it .
this kind|_|01 of stuff|_|05 is definitely|_|01 very political|_|03 because it shows|_|02 how corrupt|_|01 the venezuelan|_|01 government|_|02 is very corrupt|_|01 . i get|_|01 that every|_|01 country|_|04 has their own issues|_|05 , but what happened|_|03 here is absolutely|_|02 ridiculous|_|03 ! would n't want|_|05 to live|_|01 here at all . you guys|_|01 should check|_|01 this out whenever you get|_|01 a chance|_|01 .

it kind|_|01 of worries|_|02 me a little|_|02 bit|_|05 because sometimes|_|01 i go|_|03 through phases|_|03 where i have a really|_|01 hard|_|01 time|_|04 falling|_|10 asleep|_|02 or staying|_|09 asleep|_|02 . it 's so weird|_|02 . it happens|_|01 or no reason|_|02 and it last|_|05 's for like|_|02 2|_|01 weeks|_|01 and then all of a sudden|_|01 stops|_|03 and does n't happen|_|01 again for awhile|_|01 . sometimes|_|01 i 'm so tired|_|01 and i really|_|01 want|_|01 to fall|_|10 asleep|_|02 but i just ca|_|01 n't . i try|_|01 everything , melanin|_|01 , warm|_|10 milk|_|01 , an eye|_|05 mask|_|02 and a fan|_|01 or white|_|09 noise|_|04 but nothing|_|01 works|_|01 and then all of a sudden|_|01 i 'm fine|_|01 again and no problems|_|01 .
i really|_|01 feel|_|03 bad|_|01 for the yemeni|_|01 people|_|01 . they were already|_|01 unfortunate|_|03 enough|_|01 before this civil|_|06 unrest|_|02 . now it has gotten|_|01 worse|_|01 and too many|_|01 people|_|01 are dying|_|10 . i really|_|01 pray|_|01 that there is some order|_|13 and that peace|_|05 comes|_|04 to this country|_|04 . i feel|_|03 for the family|_|08 members|_|01 of the the sick|_|06 , wounded|_|05 , and dead|_|16 .
i think|_|09 it is exciting|_|06 to learn|_|08 about new|_|01 ways|_|01 to save|_|06 money|_|03 in my day|_|01 to day|_|01 life|_|05 . i am thrilled|_|02 to learn|_|08 that there is a potentially|_|01 far|_|04 more cost|_|01 effective|_|06 way|_|01 for me to live|_|02 each day|_|01 , which will put|_|01 me on my way|_|01 towards making|_|08 my dreams|_|06 come|_|04 true|_|01 . i am intrigued|_|01 by the service|_|01 and i ca|_|01 n’t wait|_|01 to sink|_|03 my teeth|_|02 into something that could be of great|_|03 service|_|01 down the road|_|02 .
hello|_|01 andrea i know|_|01 it 's only been 2|_|01 weeks|_|01 since you went|_|02 to japan|_|01 but i hope|_|03 it 's good|_|01 for you and that especially|_|01 be very careful|_|04 remember|_|01 that it 's a different|_|01 country|_|04 with a different|_|01 ethnicity|_|01 things|_|01 are very different|_|01 there i hope|_|03 you take|_|01 care|_|06 of everything since there 's a lot|_|05 of prostitution|_|01 away|_|01 from the evils|_|02 and you 'll be a good|_|01 friend|_|01 until later|_|01
it 's unfortunate|_|03 what happened|_|01 . if i was a politician|_|03 i 'd say|_|01 my heart|_|01 and prayers|_|01 go|_|05 out to the victims|_|01 affected|_|02 , but honestly|_|02 ? it 's hard|_|01 to feel|_|05 much|_|01 sympathy|_|03 for people|_|03 so far|_|05 away|_|01 . i find|_|01 the governments|_|02 efforts|_|02 to house|_|01 and protect|_|02 the affected|_|01 civilians|_|01 admirable|_|02 . we have federal|_|01 agencies|_|01 devoted|_|18 to disaster|_|01 relief|_|05 in the us|_|01 , but we only go|_|05 so far|_|05 in helping|_|01 people|_|03 .
wow|_|02 , what an amazing|_|01 story|_|03 . i had no idea|_|01 that the erika virus|_|03 could cause|_|02 such horrific|_|02 developmental|_|01 problems|_|01 in children|_|03 . as a parent|_|01 of 2|_|01 myself , nothing|_|01 scares|_|02 me more than to think|_|05 about all the horrible|_|03 things|_|05 that could happen|_|02 to my kids|_|02 in this world|_|03 , and what i would do to prevent|_|01 them from having to endure|_|01 such things|_|05 . what a terrible|_|02 disease|_|01 , and one|_|06 that we know|_|11 so little|_|08 about and have essentially|_|01 no real|_|03 medicine|_|03 type|_|06 treatment|_|03 for ! i 'm sure|_|07 it 's only a matter|_|02 of time|_|01 before this makes|_|36 it 's way|_|11 closer|_|02 to where i live|_|02 ! scary|_|01 !
hey . have u|_|01 heard|_|02 about the accident|_|02 where a fuel|_|01 tank|_|01 exploded|_|08 and around|_|04 75|_|01 people|_|01 where burned|_|21 to death|_|01 and many|_|01 more are injured|_|01 . what a world|_|01 we live|_|02 in where people|_|01 for some profit|_|02 put|_|01 their life|_|05 in danger|_|02 as well|_|07 as other . this make|_|27 me sick|_|01 to my core|_|09 . who going|_|04 to take|_|29 responsibility|_|02 for all that life|_|05 lost|_|07 and uncomfortable|_|01
i do n't know|_|01 who leon|_|03 russell|_|05 is , but maybe|_|01 you do ? apparently|_|01 he passed|_|01 away|_|06 in his|_|01 sleep|_|01 . i have n't heard|_|02 of the guy|_|03 , but he sounded|_|02 like|_|02 quite|_|04 the musician|_|02 . anyways|_|01 , he passed|_|01 away|_|06 at 74|_|01 years|_|01 old|_|04 , which is a long|_|06 life|_|01 . the article|_|04 i read|_|06 stated|_|02 he had some health|_|02 issues|_|02 , unfortunately|_|01 . poor|_|01 guy|_|03 . i hope|_|03 he passed|_|01 peacefully|_|01 .
these poor|_|06 people|_|03 in syria|_|01 . on the lookout|_|04 all the time|_|06 , every|_|01 time|_|06 you hear|_|02 a bang|_|03 or a noise|_|04 they must|_|01 shake|_|05 . this is so bad|_|01 these poor|_|06 people|_|03 were just going|_|02 to school|_|02 . the place|_|01 you should feel|_|05 safe|_|01 . your trying|_|01 to make|_|08 yourself better|_|02 to learn|_|02 something . if russia|_|01 targeted|_|01 this school|_|02 then i hope|_|03 they get|_|01 what they deserve|_|01 . they should think|_|09 about their families|_|01 when carrying|_|02 out an attack|_|05 such as this .
i just font|_|01 have many|_|01 feeling|_|05 about this article|_|04 . i guess|_|02 i feel|_|05 bad|_|01 for the teachers|_|02 but it does n't exactly|_|03 bother|_|01 me . i am not too concerned|_|01 with affairs|_|01 in other countries|_|02 unless it is about war|_|04 or peace|_|02 and political|_|03 things|_|11 . packing|_|01 up and having to move|_|14 your live|_|01 away|_|01 in just a few days|_|01 is very hard|_|12 and i guess|_|02 i feel|_|05 some sympathy|_|02 about that .
i just read|_|06 about all kinds|_|01 of rioting|_|01 going|_|01 on in ethiopia|_|01 . it 's really|_|01 a shame|_|02 what is going|_|01 on over there . this is an area|_|01 which has hopes|_|02 of dramatic|_|02 infrastructure|_|02 improvement|_|03 and new|_|04 jobs|_|01 . many|_|01 people|_|03 and organizations|_|06 have invested|_|01 a lot|_|05 of money|_|01 and now have to wonder|_|02 whether they should continue|_|02 to invest|_|01 in an area|_|01 which may|_|01 be destroyed|_|02 by rioters|_|01 . it 's so sad|_|02 to hear|_|02 about these beautiful|_|02 farms|_|01 and nurseries|_|01 just being gutted|_|01 and destroyed|_|02 . the farms|_|01 now have all these workers|_|02 and equipment|_|01 with nothing|_|01 to do . the farms|_|01 are gone|_|01 . it sounded|_|02 as if some of the elders|_|03 in the community|_|01 tried|_|01 to calm|_|03 things|_|08 down , and it worked|_|03 in some areas|_|01 , but other areas|_|01 just raged|_|02 on with riots|_|01 and destruction|_|02 . ca|_|01 n't these people|_|03 see|_|01 that they are ruining|_|02 their own future|_|03 ?
california|_|01 has problems|_|01 similar|_|01 to flint|_|03 michigan|_|03 when it comes|_|04 to providing|_|03 clean|_|14 water|_|01 to everyone . while california|_|01 passed|_|01 clean|_|14 water|_|01 acts|_|04 to remedy|_|02 this , it has had trouble|_|01 providing|_|03 for the poor|_|01 in unincorporated|_|01 areas|_|06 such as bethany tract|_|01 ( tip|_|01 ? ) . but california|_|01 has recognized|_|02 that having access|_|06 to clean|_|14 water|_|01 is a right|_|01 for all people|_|01 . currently|_|02 they are working|_|03 on having a nearby|_|01 city|_|01 help|_|01 provide|_|03 clean|_|14 water|_|01 to the bethany tract|_|01 citizens|_|01 . it really|_|01 makes|_|01 one|_|05 wonder|_|01 about all the damage|_|02 already|_|01 done , the health|_|02 problems|_|01 , the children|_|04 , and it makes|_|01 one|_|05 wonder|_|02 how many|_|01 other places|_|07 and other states|_|04 need|_|01 to have this resolved|_|05 .
after reading|_|06 how so many|_|01 people|_|01 think|_|01 trump|_|02 will ruin|_|01 this country|_|04 i think|_|01 its fair|_|03 to say|_|01 some of our most beloved|_|01 presidents|_|02 acted|_|01 the same why yet|_|01 we keep|_|02 them up on pedestals|_|03 . today|_|02 with social|_|04 media|_|09 we just see|_|01 the problems|_|01 more out in front|_|02 since nothing|_|01 is private|_|01 anymore|_|01 . i 'm older|_|01 63|_|01 as you know|_|01 and my mom|_|01 and granny|_|01 taught|_|02 me how to behave|_|02 . do n't go|_|03 into a room|_|04 with some man|_|08 you do n't know|_|01 . if he tries|_|01 something tell|_|01 someone|_|01 . all these ladies|_|03 who kept|_|02 quiet|_|02 or were paid|_|07 off in some way|_|12 are just as big|_|05 a part|_|01 of the problem|_|01 as any man|_|08 who abuses|_|03 them . ladies|_|03 time|_|02 for us|_|01 to take|_|06 responsible|_|02 for what happens|_|01 .
we need|_|02 to make|_|43 sure|_|07 these brave|_|01 people|_|01 have more resources|_|03 . government|_|02 needs|_|02 to realize|_|03 the value|_|06 of animal|_|01 tourism|_|01 and do more to stop|_|03 poaching|_|01 . once these precious|_|02 animals|_|01 are gone|_|01 , there will be no bringing|_|04 them back|_|03 . we need|_|02 to do more to make|_|43 sure|_|07 this does not happen|_|03 . poaching|_|01 is a huge|_|01 problem|_|01 in africa|_|01 and penalties|_|01 need|_|02 to be severe|_|06
check|_|10 out this article|_|04 . i wonder|_|02 someday|_|01 when all of these theoretic|_|01 articles|_|04 will change|_|06 how things|_|08 are done ? should we be doing massive|_|03 changes|_|06 in the way|_|11 our government|_|02 works|_|09 , the way|_|11 people|_|03 are allowed|_|10 to function|_|02 ? the products|_|02 we are able|_|02 to buy|_|04 and the activities|_|01 we are allowed|_|10 to partake|_|03 in ? will private|_|02 jets|_|07 disappear|_|04 ?
" i just heard|_|02 that the editor|_|01 of ellie|_|01 magazine|_|01 killed|_|09 herself . it is always|_|04 sad|_|02 when someone|_|01 take|_|05 their own life|_|03 . what makes|_|35 this one|_|01 worse|_|01 than the usual|_|01 is that there were chances|_|02 that she could have been helped|_|01 but she was turned|_|20 away|_|10 . they said|_|01 that she was " " over the worst|_|01 of it " " but other evidence|_|02 suggests|_|03 that she was not . to me it seems|_|02 like|_|02 people|_|01 did not want|_|03 to deal|_|01 with her for some reason|_|06 or they were on a small|_|01 budget|_|02 and could not afford|_|01 to treat|_|05 her so they turned|_|20 her away|_|10 . very sad|_|02 and very messed|_|02 up that you turn|_|20 away|_|10 someone|_|01 whop|_|01 wants|_|03 helps|_|01 db|_|01 they then kill|_|09 themselves . the system|_|08 needs|_|02 to be fixed|_|02 .

the eldest|_|01 generation|_|01 of russians|_|02 are n't being treated|_|03 properly|_|01 and should have some sort|_|04 of financial|_|01 compensation|_|02 . they are living|_|01 off very little|_|01 per day|_|07 financially|_|01 and live|_|01 in poor|_|06 conditions|_|05 . after paying|_|10 utilities|_|04 , they barely|_|01 have enough|_|01 for food|_|03 . health|_|02 care|_|06 has also|_|02 taken|_|01 a turn|_|12 for the worse|_|09 because they ca|_|01 n't afford|_|03 to get|_|01 proper|_|04 health|_|02 treatment|_|01 due|_|03 to the costs|_|01 involved|_|01
so , i just read|_|06 an article|_|04 that i have absolutely|_|01 no interest|_|01 in . it was a bunch|_|03 of gossip|_|02 about val wilmer 's health|_|02 , as if that is newsworthy|_|01 . i 'm not even|_|03 sure|_|06 why i read|_|06 the whole|_|01 thing|_|05 . i gained|_|08 nothing|_|01 in the way|_|11 of knowledge|_|01 by reading|_|06 this article|_|04 . what a waste|_|02 of time|_|06 ! people|_|01 really|_|01 should learn|_|01 how to mind|_|02 their own business|_|05 .
i can not believe|_|01 that their is still|_|04 such hate|_|01 in the world|_|01 . when i read|_|03 stories|_|03 like|_|02 this i think|_|03 about how we really|_|01 need|_|02 to come|_|04 together|_|04 and rid|_|01 the world|_|01 of such hate|_|01 . all those times|_|06 we talked|_|02 about things|_|08 like|_|02 this happening|_|04 all over the world|_|01 really|_|01 make|_|18 you think|_|03 about your own life|_|01 and what we are doing to make|_|18 a change|_|01 / positive|_|01 impact|_|02 on the world|_|01 . i think|_|03 it is very sad|_|02 to see|_|05 lives|_|01 wasted|_|03 in this manner|_|01 such as careless|_|03 deaths|_|01 that will get|_|01 no one|_|02 anywhere|_|01 . i know|_|01 that you have told|_|03 me a lot|_|02 of the same things|_|08 , so i wanted|_|02 to see|_|05 how you felt|_|01 about this too .
i feel|_|05 bad|_|09 for the teachers|_|02 but there are so many|_|01 teachers|_|02 in this country|_|04 that i would like|_|04 to see|_|01 expelled|_|01 . it is amazing|_|01 how much|_|01 power|_|01 turkey|_|02 has . i do not really|_|01 understand|_|02 this power|_|01 but it must|_|01 be difficult|_|02 to pack|_|02 up your life|_|01 so quickly|_|01 . i ca|_|01 n't imagine|_|02 having to do that . how does anyone start|_|09 fresh|_|12 when they were expelled|_|01 . you would always|_|04 feel|_|05 like|_|02 it is going|_|03 to happen|_|04 again .
how terrible|_|01 it would be to live|_|05 your life|_|08 knowing|_|05 you murdered|_|01 someone|_|01 . it would be interesting|_|01 to speak|_|02 to somebody|_|01 , who was maybe|_|01 sixty|_|01 or seventy|_|01 , and had murdered|_|01 someone|_|01 as a young|_|01 person|_|01 , what they would have to say|_|01 about it , how they feel|_|05 about it and what they 've learned|_|02 , having killed|_|09 someone|_|01 , about themselves and society|_|03 .
the article|_|04 about sleep|_|02 disorders|_|01 really|_|01 hits|_|04 home|_|01 , because i know|_|01 more than one|_|03 person|_|01 who would be diagnosed|_|02 with a sleep|_|02 disorder|_|01 . all of these people|_|01 just happen|_|04 to be overnight|_|01 workers|_|01 , too . the fact|_|03 that the lack|_|01 of sleep|_|03 and quality|_|05 sleep|_|02 can lead|_|23 to a higher|_|01 risk|_|02 of stroke|_|03 is very alarming|_|02 . so many|_|01 people|_|01 need|_|02 to seek|_|01 help|_|01 for sleep|_|03 disorders|_|01 , because where the disorder|_|01 itself may|_|01 not cause|_|02 major|_|04 health|_|02 issues|_|01 , it can lead|_|23 to major|_|04 health|_|02 issues|_|01 .
i just read|_|06 an article|_|04 about cave|_|01 divers|_|02 in florida|_|01 who died|_|05 trying|_|01 to explore|_|02 the cave|_|01 system|_|02 . it seems|_|02 like|_|02 an incredibly|_|01 dangerous|_|01 thing|_|11 to do . i 'm not so sure|_|02 i see|_|01 the benefit|_|02 in doing this kind|_|01 of activity|_|01 . i feel|_|05 like|_|02 they people|_|03 knew|_|05 the risks|_|02 and what could happen|_|01 if things|_|11 go|_|02 wrong|_|02 . this is not something i 'd do myself .

reading|_|06 an article|_|04 that is basically|_|01 on the fear|_|03 and risk|_|03 of the erika virus|_|03 and how it is currently|_|02 an issue|_|01 . it does n't affect|_|01 my felling|_|03 at all . it is clearly|_|01 and issue|_|02 but they 'll make|_|02 a vaccine|_|01 for those who do n't become|_|04 immune|_|03 by way|_|01 of their own system|_|05 , then the virus|_|03 will become|_|04 resistant|_|03 to the vaccinations|_|02 and it will be a never|_|01 ending|_|04 up and down cycle|_|01 that we see|_|01 all the time|_|02 . i simply|_|04 just ca|_|01 n't let|_|01 something like|_|02 this , despite|_|02 the risk|_|03 , affect|_|01 my feelings|_|01 and emotions|_|01 .

i 'm not sure|_|07 what can be done but global|_|01 warming|_|01 is affecting|_|01 us|_|01 in many|_|01 other areas|_|01 then the ones|_|01 we have seen|_|02 and heard|_|02 . did you know|_|10 our coffee|_|01 crops|_|01 are in danger|_|02 of being wiped|_|01 out ? that 's right|_|12 , i just read|_|06 this article|_|02 detailing|_|02 the struggles|_|03 currently|_|02 going|_|01 on with coffee|_|01 crop|_|01 farmers|_|03 . there is an intense|_|03 struggle|_|03 at the moment|_|06 for them to maintain|_|04 their crops|_|01 and to keep|_|02 them going|_|01 . the warm|_|10 temperatures|_|02 have really|_|01 threw|_|06 a wrench|_|03 into their day|_|01 to day|_|01 operations|_|03 and maintaining|_|04 the coffee|_|01 crops|_|01 has become|_|01 quite|_|04 a challenge|_|05 . we are in danger|_|02 of either|_|01 paying|_|07 really|_|01 high|_|01 prices|_|04 on coffee|_|01 or worse|_|09 case|_|05 scenario|_|03 being without coffee|_|01 period|_|01 . this is very distressing|_|01 for me . can you imagine|_|01 not having our cup|_|08 of coffee|_|01 daily|_|01 to get|_|01 us|_|01 through the days|_|01 ? this is truly|_|01 tragic|_|01 .
this was an interesting|_|04 article|_|04 . i am a supporter|_|01 of capital|_|02 punishment|_|01 , yet|_|04 i find|_|02 lethal|_|02 injection|_|03 to be absolutely|_|02 ridiculous|_|03 . it costs|_|02 an insane|_|01 amount|_|01 of money|_|03 just to execute|_|01 somebody|_|01 with this method|_|01 , when a few bullets|_|01 for less|_|03 than a couple|_|01 dollars|_|02 would do the job|_|02 just as well|_|09 if not better|_|09 .
its inspiration|_|05 and these people|_|03 are still|_|01 finding|_|01 hard|_|12 to donate|_|01 blood|_|05 to the victims|_|02 despite|_|02 the archaic|_|02 rules|_|09 regarding|_|05 blood|_|05 donations|_|03 . the odds|_|02 of hiv|_|01 infection|_|07 are so low|_|01 that these blood|_|05 donation|_|03 laws|_|04 need|_|01 to be rolled|_|03 back|_|06 , like|_|02 in argentina|_|02 . in the short|_|03 term|_|03 though|_|01 , a way|_|12 to help|_|05 would be organizing|_|04 a blood|_|05 drive|_|12 so those victims|_|02 will get|_|02 all the blood|_|05 they need|_|01 .
i like|_|05 lena|_|01 heady|_|01 , and , even|_|03 though|_|01 she plays|_|02 one|_|02 of the worst|_|01 mother|_|05 's on television|_|01 , i can imagine|_|02 that she must|_|01 be a ball|_|07 of nerves|_|03 over this custody|_|01 dispute|_|02 . i can;t imagine|_|02 having to go|_|02 through this , especially|_|01 since the custody|_|01 seemed|_|04 to be agreed|_|01 upon . her ex|_|02 husband|_|01 does n't seem|_|04 to be thinking|_|05 about wylie|_|01 's best|_|03 interest|_|01 - only his|_|01 own . if it were me , i 'd fight|_|02 tooth|_|05 and nail|_|03 to keep|_|02 my son|_|02 in the same country|_|04 as me .
it is sad|_|01 that people|_|01 have nothing|_|01 better|_|09 to do than to get|_|02 into other people|_|01 's business|_|01 . it seems|_|02 that we are at an all time|_|06 low|_|01 as a society|_|02 and that there is no respect|_|02 for other people|_|01 's privacy|_|01 . this is what i see|_|22 as the darker|_|02 side|_|06 of the internet|_|01 . it opens|_|03 the the door|_|04 for behavior|_|01 that should not be encouraged|_|03 in for a safe|_|02 and productive|_|03 society|_|02 .
i had no idea|_|03 that caffeine|_|01 powder|_|03 could cause|_|02 problems|_|01 like|_|04 that ! other than the obviousness|_|01 of it being caffeine|_|01 , i wonder|_|01 if it 's any worse|_|01 than coffee|_|01 in that way|_|11 , or if it 's just because its usually|_|01 a hidden|_|03 product|_|04 . also|_|02 comforter|_|01 , i have definitely|_|01 taken|_|06 in things|_|08 before , it 's been in menstrual|_|01 supplements|_|01 , i did n't know|_|05 that . i feel|_|05 like|_|04 i 've seen|_|02 green|_|04 tea|_|01 powder|_|03 in something as well|_|13 .
knowing|_|01 how you love|_|01 animals|_|01 , i thought|_|01 you would like|_|02 to read|_|03 about the four|_|01 paws|_|01 removal|_|01 of the surviving|_|02 animals|_|01 in a gaza|_|01 strip|_|06 zoo|_|02 . first|_|01 of all , the zoo|_|02 was horrid|_|01 . less|_|03 than 20|_|01 animals|_|01 remained|_|04 of the hundreds|_|01 that had been previously|_|01 housed|_|02 here . the rescue|_|01 of the animals|_|01 occurred|_|03 under rather|_|02 harrowing|_|01 conditions|_|08 with haas and israeli|_|01 forces|_|01 launching|_|05 misses|_|03 during the evacuation|_|01 process|_|05 . it sounds|_|02 as though|_|01 the surviving|_|02 animals|_|01 will end|_|04 up in different|_|03 locations|_|04 that deal|_|02 with their specific|_|04 species|_|01 . they will be rehabilitated|_|03 and may|_|01 eventually|_|01 be released|_|08 back|_|01 into the wild|_|03 . let|_|02 me know|_|01 what you think|_|01 .
wow|_|02 , this is terrible|_|02 ! i know|_|11 a lot|_|05 of you use|_|01 l'oreal products|_|05 . you should read|_|03 this . it has to do with a woman|_|02 getting|_|01 awful|_|02 burns|_|01 from using|_|01 their products|_|05 . she 's going|_|04 to sue|_|01 the company|_|03 . i think|_|03 we should support|_|04 her . no company|_|03 should get|_|01 away|_|01 with this . it 's a horrible|_|03 reaction|_|07 and it 's just plain|_|01 terrible|_|02 what she has to go|_|04 through .
i read|_|05 an article|_|04 about the gender|_|04 gap|_|01 in the world|_|08 today|_|01 . sadly|_|02 the us|_|01 has moved|_|03 down in the list|_|04 behind|_|01 all of the major|_|08 european|_|01 countries|_|02 . i guess|_|04 the number|_|02 of women|_|02 working|_|21 in senior|_|01 positions|_|15 is shrinking|_|01 . there is also|_|02 a decline|_|05 of women|_|02 in the labor|_|01 force|_|01 . but there is evidence|_|03 that the education|_|05 gender|_|04 gap|_|01 is shrinking|_|01 , so there are more women|_|02 educated|_|01 . it just seems|_|04 that more women|_|02 are choosing|_|01 not to work|_|21 .
i think|_|03 it 's unfortunate|_|01 that people|_|01 are targeting|_|01 children|_|03 to join|_|02 their terrorist|_|01 communities|_|01 . it 's sad|_|01 because all these kids|_|02 have a future|_|03 but they get|_|02 wrapped|_|03 up in this brainwashing|_|01 stuff|_|07 . and then people|_|01 are perfectly|_|02 fine|_|06 pinning|_|04 it on an entire|_|02 community|_|01 and that 's not fair|_|07 because it really|_|01 had nothing|_|01 to do with the community|_|01 itself and was more of an individuals|_|01 decision|_|01
the fact|_|04 that human|_|03 beings are abusing|_|01 the planet|_|02 and each other is evident|_|03 in this article|_|04 . it is enough|_|02 to get|_|03 you depressed|_|02 , read|_|05 this so you can get|_|03 an idea|_|03 of how pollution|_|01 affects|_|01 third|_|01 world|_|08 countries|_|04 . instead|_|01 of going|_|03 after industries|_|02 ( probably|_|01 all american|_|03 ) with fines|_|01 , they rather|_|01 close|_|01 schools|_|07 because of the pollution|_|01 and smog|_|01 . their health|_|02 is being affected|_|01 and not only that , the environment|_|02 is being completely|_|01 abused|_|01 .
hey my bf joan , how have you been i read|_|03 this interesting|_|01 article|_|04 and man|_|08 i feel|_|05 weird|_|02 living|_|02 in a country|_|04 like|_|04 i do now . all these issues|_|02 and money|_|03 being wasted|_|10 for what ? i really|_|01 feel|_|05 like|_|04 we as people|_|01 and a nation|_|04 can do much|_|01 better|_|07 then this . i hope|_|03 we can evolve|_|02 to become|_|04 better|_|07 people|_|01 in this world|_|08 .
i just read|_|06 the most disturbing|_|11 article|_|01 about terry|_|02 jones|_|06 -- that actor|_|02 who used|_|01 to be on monty python|_|03 . apparently|_|01 he has a relatively|_|01 serious|_|01 form|_|01 of dementia|_|01 known|_|01 as primary|_|03 progressive|_|01 aphasia|_|01 which affects|_|01 the ability|_|01 to speak|_|03 , recall|_|01 words|_|07 , and generally|_|01 be able|_|03 to communicate|_|05 with people|_|03 . so terribly|_|02 sad|_|02 . i ca|_|01 n't even|_|01 imagine|_|02 how his|_|01 family|_|08 must|_|01 feel|_|05 . it would be terrible|_|01 to watch|_|06 someone|_|01 you love|_|01 slowly|_|01 deteriorate|_|03 like|_|02 that , .
" that idiot|_|01 deserves|_|01 a lot|_|04 worse|_|01 but hopefully|_|02 we can erase|_|01 all symbols|_|02 of his|_|01 existence|_|01 soon|_|01 . starting|_|07 with everything he did as president|_|02 , but then get|_|07 rid|_|01 of all his|_|01 buildings|_|07 and everything else|_|03 with his|_|01 name|_|04 on it . maybe|_|01 when he pays|_|10 for his|_|01 crimes|_|01 he will have to sell|_|03 all those buildings|_|07 off . it would be great|_|03 to get|_|07 a full|_|06 accounting|_|04 of everything he actually|_|02 owns so that he can repay|_|01 everyone he has ever|_|03 ripped|_|04 off over his|_|01 lifetime|_|05 of scamming|_|03 people|_|01 . the name|_|04 " " trump|_|02 " " should forever|_|01 be associated|_|01 with crime|_|01 , gifting|_|08 , treason|_|01 , lying|_|06 , cheating|_|01 and just generally|_|02 being a piece|_|01 of human|_|03 garbage|_|03 . let|_|02 his|_|01 stupid|_|01 kids|_|02 live|_|01 with that brand|_|01 . "
the indonesian|_|01 government|_|03 is not doing enough|_|01 to protect|_|02 some forest|_|02 land|_|04 . the orangutans|_|01 who number|_|01 seven|_|01 fifty|_|01 to seventeen|_|01 fifty|_|01 will be completely|_|01 wiped|_|01 out if the company|_|06 that is clearing|_|01 this land|_|04 is allowed|_|06 to continue|_|02 . what can we do to form|_|02 a protest|_|02 or let|_|02 the government|_|03 know|_|11 that this is not right|_|04 . can you help|_|05 me with some ideas|_|01 ? maybe|_|01 we email|_|01 the indonesian|_|01 government|_|03 first|_|01 or attempt|_|01 to call|_|09 them . after that maybe|_|01 we can plan|_|02 to picket|_|01 or have a demonstration|_|02 at the capitol|_|02 building|_|01 voicing|_|01 our concerns|_|03 . do you feel|_|08 the same about this that i do ? if you font|_|01 i will get|_|02 someone|_|01 else|_|03 to help|_|05 me or i will go|_|01 it alone|_|02 . i just feel|_|08 so strongly|_|01 that something productive|_|05 needs|_|02 to be done and fast|_|01 . if we drag|_|01 our feet|_|01 they will have this land|_|04 cleared|_|01 before we can blink|_|04 an eye|_|05 .
it seem|_|02 like|_|02 we have enters|_|02 the day|_|05 where people|_|01 are more sensitive|_|02 to political|_|03 issues|_|01 that ever|_|03 before . although people|_|01 may|_|01 not agree|_|01 with the current|_|01 administration|_|01 under trump|_|02 they can not flat|_|04 or blame|_|03 other for their personal|_|04 beliefs|_|01 . it is especially|_|01 a shame|_|02 when a mom|_|01 will kick|_|01 out their own child|_|02 for mock|_|01 voting|_|01 is a manner|_|03 that she find|_|05 unfitting|_|02 .
i think|_|09 that these types|_|06 of tragic|_|01 accidents|_|02 are far|_|05 and few . i might|_|01 be wrong|_|05 , though|_|01 i do n't hear|_|02 of too many|_|01 of them . i think|_|09 that they may|_|01 need|_|03 to reevaluate|_|01 some of their maintenance|_|03 techniques|_|01 to try|_|01 and make|_|07 this even|_|03 more uncommon|_|01 . it must|_|01 of really|_|01 devastated|_|01 the family|_|01 and friends|_|03 of those who lost|_|11 their lives|_|02 .
just read|_|06 an article|_|04 about a celebrity|_|01 's parents|_|02 divorcing|_|02 , which definitely|_|01 sucks|_|02 , since that 's always|_|04 been something i 've feared|_|03 would happen|_|03 with my parents|_|02 . i do n't think|_|11 the writer|_|02 of the article|_|04 understands|_|02 the emotional|_|06 weight|_|03 of the situation|_|03 , though|_|01 , since they only seem|_|04 to care|_|02 about the fact|_|03 that the dad|_|01 that filed|_|01 for divorce|_|01 is good|_|15 looking|_|09 .
i really|_|01 did n't know|_|01 leonard|_|01 cohen that much|_|05 growing|_|03 up , only listen|_|01 to a couple|_|05 of his|_|01 songs|_|01 , was n't a big|_|01 fan|_|01 but it 's tragic|_|01 that he died|_|01 , to be fair|_|03 its a good|_|13 way|_|11 to die|_|01 at an old|_|07 age|_|01 and died|_|01 while asleep|_|03 , painless|_|01 and nothing|_|01 that hurts|_|05 him . he also|_|02 said|_|01 that he was ready|_|04 to die|_|01 , so lets|_|02 take|_|29 that in for an account|_|10 , that he was prepared|_|02 to go|_|01 . so he died|_|01 peaceful|_|01 .
you should read|_|05 this article|_|04 on climate|_|02 change|_|01 . it 's incredibly|_|01 fascinating|_|01 . climate|_|02 change|_|01 is happening|_|04 and it 's really|_|01 scary|_|01 . humans|_|02 are causing|_|01 it . it will soon|_|01 be a major|_|08 problem|_|01 for us|_|01 all . it affects|_|02 all life|_|02 on earth|_|01 , not just people|_|01 . biodiversity|_|01 has been affected|_|02 and has gone|_|01 down . temperatures|_|02 are changing|_|01 for the worse|_|12 . it 's simply|_|03 awful|_|02 .
" i feel|_|05 like|_|04 the syrian|_|01 war|_|02 situation|_|06 is just completely|_|01 out of control|_|02 at this point|_|02 , but what often|_|03 bothers|_|04 me more is that people|_|01 who supported|_|09 obama for both terms|_|06 had a sort|_|01 of blind|_|01 spot|_|01 on this issue|_|02 . when the arab|_|01 spring|_|04 happened|_|04 and then the libyan|_|01 war|_|02 and now the syrian|_|01 war|_|02 ( et terrace|_|03 ) there was very little|_|08 meaningful|_|01 opposition|_|01 to it from the democrat|_|02 - voting|_|01 side|_|10 of the aisle|_|03 . republican|_|02 lawmakers|_|01 just pretended|_|42 to be opposed|_|02 to thwart|_|01 obama , if they even|_|01 did that . in reality|_|02 , the whole|_|02 government|_|02 supported|_|09 " " removing|_|01 assad " " and because that objective|_|02 was considered|_|01 so important|_|01 , now we have the current|_|01 situation|_|06 of extreme|_|04 tragedy|_|01 . i feel|_|05 like|_|04 it is hard|_|07 to convey|_|01 how important|_|01 this is .

i just read|_|03 an article|_|04 about a very strong|_|09 category|_|01 5|_|01 typhoon|_|01 , ‘ typhoon|_|01 meantime|_|01 ’ , which grew|_|01 stronger|_|09 as it swept|_|05 close|_|01 to taiwan|_|02 on wednesday|_|01 . a category|_|01 5|_|01 has intense|_|01 maximum|_|01 winds|_|01 of 230 miles|_|02 per hour|_|04 , and is being called|_|01 the strongest|_|09 storm|_|03 of the year|_|03 . there were no deaths|_|06 reported|_|04 but a handful|_|01 of injuries|_|02 and of course|_|09 electricity|_|02 is out for large|_|01 numbers|_|01 of residents|_|01 . the storm|_|03 may|_|01 intensify|_|02 as it heads|_|01 toward china|_|01 and is being monitored|_|02 . what a tragedy|_|02 could unfold|_|04 if it makes|_|03 a direct|_|07 hit|_|02 on some of the highly|_|03 populated|_|01 areas|_|01 in china|_|01 . could end|_|03 up being one|_|06 of the strongest|_|09 storms|_|03 of the century|_|01 .
i just read|_|06 the most terrible|_|02 article|_|04 about war|_|03 and terrorism|_|01 , i could n't even|_|04 imagine|_|02 the fear|_|03 these people|_|03 are living|_|02 . they are being forced|_|02 from their homes|_|01 by threats|_|02 of death|_|01 . the conditions|_|01 in this area|_|01 are terrible|_|02 . they 're low|_|01 on most supplies|_|02 including|_|01 food|_|03 . so prices|_|01 for everything are inflated|_|03 to prices|_|01 they ca|_|01 n't even|_|04 afford|_|03 . i literally|_|02 can not imagine|_|02 at all living|_|01 in a place|_|01 like|_|02 this . there are so many|_|01 others senseless|_|01 killings|_|02 in that area|_|01 already|_|01 , i would fear|_|03 for the life|_|03 of my family|_|01 and myself !
there are several|_|01 strange|_|02 factors|_|01 surrounding|_|01 the tragic|_|01 and fatal|_|06 event|_|02 . first|_|01 , why was there not a sign|_|01 or caution|_|02 tape|_|01 to block|_|03 off the broken|_|28 elevator|_|01 ? how was the mother|_|01 able|_|03 to walk|_|10 into it without knowing|_|10 that it was broken|_|28 ? the other tenant|_|01 's reports|_|01 about the condition|_|06 of the elevators|_|01 in the past|_|03 are also|_|02 alarming|_|02 . why was this problem|_|01 not addressed|_|09 long|_|02 ago|_|01 by the landlord|_|01 ? it should not take|_|06 such a horrible|_|03 event|_|02 to occur|_|01 for people|_|03 to recognize|_|02 that there is a problem|_|01 with the building|_|01 and the way|_|09 technicians|_|02 are doing inspections|_|01 .
these days|_|07 , women|_|01 are winning|_|01 in sports|_|05 . there has been so many|_|01 instances|_|01 of men|_|01 prevailing|_|04 in their sport|_|05 that it is now time|_|03 that women|_|01 do the same . sports|_|05 have been men|_|01 's things|_|12 for so long|_|02 and i am happy|_|01 to see|_|01 that there are women|_|01 joining|_|04 the ranks|_|01 of these top|_|01 athletes|_|01 . i am so proud|_|01 of my species|_|01 and how we have come|_|01 so far|_|04 in equality|_|02 . i love|_|01 that there are more even|_|04 playing|_|05 grounds|_|02 now .
we should protect|_|01 our environment|_|01 from now on . i think|_|11 a lot|_|05 of wild|_|01 animals|_|01 have been put|_|04 into danger|_|02 because of human|_|03 beings . people|_|01 have put|_|04 too much|_|01 plastics|_|01 into the oceans|_|02 and pollute|_|01 the living|_|02 society|_|02 of wild|_|01 animals|_|01 . it was danger|_|02 to them if there is plastic|_|02 around|_|01 . i wish|_|04 people|_|01 will do a better|_|01 jobs|_|02 .
hello|_|01 there , i think|_|09 this situation|_|01 in haiti|_|01 needs|_|02 our attention|_|01 . it 's clear|_|08 that these people|_|01 are suffering|_|03 after such a catastrophe|_|03 befell|_|01 them . i urge|_|05 you to donate|_|01 and make|_|43 a difference|_|04 in these people|_|01 's lives|_|13 especially|_|01 the children|_|04 who are suffering|_|03 and do n't have anything to eat|_|06 . every|_|01 dollar|_|04 will count|_|06 i think|_|09
there was this little|_|03 boy|_|04 found|_|01 dead|_|01 down a well|_|05 somewhere|_|01 in china|_|01 . he fell|_|08 down there well|_|12 helping|_|01 his|_|01 father|_|01 harvest|_|04 , i guess|_|02 on a farm|_|01 they own . what kind|_|01 of weird|_|01 is that they were n't able|_|02 to get|_|01 him out till|_|01 four|_|01 days|_|01 later|_|01 ; not really|_|01 sure|_|07 why they could n't get|_|01 him out sooner|_|01 ... could have saved|_|08 his|_|01 life|_|01 . maybe|_|01 they just did n't have enough|_|02 resources|_|02 ... sad|_|02 ... very sad|_|02 ...
it is really|_|01 sad|_|02 the way|_|11 that people|_|01 only see|_|05 one|_|01 side|_|02 of the story|_|02 of the afghan|_|01 war|_|01 . we only see|_|05 things|_|08 from our side|_|02 of the pond|_|01 , and we see|_|05 the good|_|13 , but not all of the bad|_|01 that we do , as a country|_|02 . we tend|_|02 to think|_|10 of things|_|08 , in generalities|_|02 , and lump|_|02 groups|_|01 of people|_|01 who live|_|02 in a common|_|01 area|_|01 , into one|_|01 pile|_|02 of terrorists|_|01 . there are plenty|_|02 of people|_|01 in afghanistan|_|01 who are against eh taliban|_|01 , and we font|_|01 see|_|05 the damage|_|02 that we are doing by hitting|_|05 them with drone|_|01 strikes|_|05 . most casualties|_|04 in wars|_|01 are civilians|_|01 , who had nothing|_|01 to do with the conflict|_|01 itself . there are always|_|04 conflicting|_|02 stories|_|02 about the death|_|06 tolls|_|03 . i believe|_|01 it is used|_|04 to de|_|04 - escalate|_|01 our fears|_|03 that , we , as a country|_|02 , are doing something that could actually|_|02 turn|_|20 out to be very harmful|_|01 instead|_|01 of helpful|_|01
so i think|_|02 i just read|_|06 the most interesting|_|01 article|_|04 to date|_|08 ever|_|03 published|_|03 . a girl|_|02 ran|_|01 into a police|_|01 officer|_|01 with her car|_|01 , while taking|_|29 a nude|_|01 topless|_|01 selfish|_|01 to send|_|02 to her boyfriend|_|01 . feel|_|05 a little|_|01 bad|_|01 for her , even|_|01 though|_|01 she should not be doing this , especially|_|01 with a glass|_|01 of wine|_|01 in her cup|_|08 holder|_|03 aha . guessing|_|02 she was drunk|_|01 , which is the main|_|01 crime|_|02 here . she had a bond|_|01 of 2000 dollars|_|04 i believe|_|01 . i kind|_|01 of want|_|01 her to be freed|_|01 aha .
just read|_|06 an article|_|04 that explored|_|02 trump|_|02 's appeal|_|02 and why he won|_|05 the election|_|04 . it indicated|_|03 that trump|_|02 had a simple|_|01 appeal|_|02 to the darker|_|02 side|_|09 of people|_|01 , the look|_|02 out for myself and not others side|_|09 , it explored|_|02 trump|_|02 's ability|_|02 to partner|_|01 with those that are hurting|_|06 and feel|_|12 left|_|08 out of society|_|02 through lack|_|01 of jobs|_|12 , etc . he used|_|01 this association|_|01 to promote|_|01 his|_|01 agenda|_|02 , with simple|_|01 phrases|_|04 that were easy|_|04 to remember|_|07 , and tailored|_|01 it to the good|_|18 old|_|03 boy|_|01 network|_|02 . the article|_|04 did n't really|_|01 explore|_|02 russia|_|01 's influence|_|01 on the election|_|04 , only addressed|_|05 trump|_|02 's appeal|_|02 to certain|_|01 groups|_|01 .
i do n't understand|_|01 why we continue|_|02 to fight|_|02 this battle|_|01 . people|_|03 in our military|_|03 are getting|_|14 killed|_|01 . it is not a good|_|13 sign|_|02 that anything positive|_|02 is happening|_|01 over there . i hate|_|01 reading|_|05 about military|_|03 deaths|_|01 . it is so sad|_|02 that people|_|03 have to go|_|16 out there and fight|_|02 . it seems|_|04 unfair|_|01 to me that their families|_|01 at home|_|01 get|_|01 to get|_|14 the phone|_|01 calls|_|03 that their love|_|02 ones|_|01 have died|_|04 regardless|_|01 of the circumstances|_|02 . we need|_|01 to do a better|_|13 job|_|01 at fighting|_|02 batters|_|02 we actually|_|02 need|_|01 to fight|_|02 , vs|_|01 fighting|_|02 the battles|_|01 of others .
" so i just read|_|08 another|_|01 article|_|04 where a teacher|_|02 compared|_|04 president|_|02 trump|_|02 to adolph hitler|_|01 . and the teacher|_|02 had the nerve|_|01 to say|_|01 that his|_|01 lesson|_|04 plans|_|03 are always|_|01 " " factually|_|01 based|_|01 " " . the last|_|05 time|_|06 i checked|_|01 , donald trump|_|02 has not interred|_|02 15|_|01 million|_|02 jews|_|01 to concentration|_|06 camps|_|01 where he has killed|_|12 them . typical|_|03 liberal|_|08 democrat|_|02 with so much|_|01 hyperbole|_|01 . teachers|_|02 need|_|03 to stick|_|03 to teaching|_|02 the facts|_|03 and not interjecting|_|01 their opinions|_|01 into their lessons|_|04 . "
the somali|_|01 pope|_|02 are suffering|_|10 greatly|_|01 . i feel|_|11 so bad|_|01 for what they have had to go|_|03 through over the past|_|01 while . donald trump|_|02 does n't have enough|_|02 mercy|_|01 or understanding|_|02 for what they are going|_|03 through . the united|_|01 states|_|02 may|_|01 offer|_|02 some help|_|02 , but not nearly|_|07 enough|_|01 . they will be in poverty|_|01 likely|_|01 their entire|_|02 lives|_|06 , and it is just not fair|_|03 . there must|_|01 be a way|_|05 to test|_|07 to see|_|01 if they are dangerous|_|02 , and if not they should be welcomed|_|03 into our country|_|04 .
now a days|_|01 for money|_|03 people|_|01 are doing anything , school|_|05 children|_|01 to make|_|02 addict|_|02 of porn|_|01 websites|_|01 and make|_|02 porn|_|01 video|_|01 from them , i will tell|_|01 one|_|06 incident|_|02 . the former|_|01 elementary|_|01 school|_|05 volunteer|_|02 accused|_|02 of producing|_|02 child|_|01 pornography|_|01 involving|_|07 students|_|01 as young|_|04 as 9|_|01 has been indicted|_|01 on two|_|01 additional|_|03 sex|_|01 . the guy|_|02 denote|_|01 carr away|_|06 , 23|_|01 , of lenard|_|01 , now faces|_|04 a total|_|05 of 15|_|01 federal|_|04 counts|_|01 of sexual|_|02 exploitation|_|02 of a minor|_|08 to produce|_|02 child|_|01 pornography|_|01 . the federal|_|04 charges|_|06 are separate|_|03 from local|_|02 charges|_|06 that carr away|_|06 faces|_|04 in prince|_|01 george|_|07 ’s county|_|01 , where a local|_|02 grand|_|07 jury|_|02 indicted|_|01 him on 270 counts|_|01 of sex|_|01 crimes|_|02 and child|_|01 pornography|_|01 involving|_|07 23|_|01 children|_|01 as young|_|04 as 9|_|01 years|_|03 old|_|02 .
i just read|_|03 about arnold|_|02 palmer|_|01 dying|_|03 . he was a fixture|_|01 on sunday|_|02 afternoons|_|01 watching|_|06 golf|_|01 . i really|_|01 wish|_|06 that he was still|_|04 around|_|04 , i will miss|_|06 him out on the course|_|02 . he has always|_|02 been around|_|04 since i was a kid|_|01 , even|_|03 when he quit|_|01 playing|_|01 he would be out there for the major|_|08 championships|_|02 . i think|_|12 it will be different|_|03 watching|_|06 them without him around|_|04 . he was a genuinely|_|01 nice|_|04 man|_|08 .
i feel|_|05 bad|_|01 for the kid|_|01 that fell|_|08 into the gorilla|_|01 enclosure|_|04 and chamber|_|01 , the meme|_|01 king|_|10 of 2016 . it sucks|_|02 that they had to shoot|_|11 the gorilla|_|01 , but it did n't know|_|05 what it was doing to hurt|_|06 the kid|_|01 and it seemed|_|02 like|_|02 there was no choice|_|02 but to kill|_|05 him . it must|_|01 have been an awful|_|01 downer|_|01 for the zoo|_|02 visitors|_|01 who expected|_|03 to have a relaxing|_|01 and fun|_|03 day|_|10 of leisure|_|02 . in my opinion|_|02 the zoo|_|02 should have given|_|03 the visitors|_|01 present|_|01 at the shooting|_|11 a coupon|_|02 for a future|_|03 visit|_|02 or something like|_|02 that to ease|_|03 the downer|_|01 .
what i have learned|_|01 from afghanistan|_|01 is that they are really|_|01 the source|_|03 of corruption|_|01 in the middle|_|04 east|_|05 . afghanistan|_|01 went|_|01 through bad|_|14 conditions|_|03 in the last|_|09 three|_|02 decades|_|01 but in the new|_|05 government|_|02 of amid kari from 2000 it 's started|_|10 developing|_|01 again many|_|01 reconstruction|_|04 and other works|_|02 can be seen|_|01 . it 's going|_|01 to take|_|09 a lot|_|05 of work|_|02 though|_|01 .
more trouble|_|04 at the north|_|04 dakota|_|02 pipeline|_|02 protests|_|03 ! they have brought|_|01 in riot|_|01 police|_|01 who are trying|_|01 to break|_|02 up the protesters|_|01 . it looks|_|02 like|_|02 they are using|_|06 rubber|_|01 bullets|_|01 and arresting|_|01 a lot|_|07 of people|_|01 . it is scary|_|01 that we can not peacefully|_|01 protest|_|02 in this country|_|04 without fear|_|03 of injury|_|01 or arrest|_|02 . i hope|_|03 everyone is okay|_|01 .
what do you think|_|03 about guantanamo|_|01 bay|_|01 ? should they shut|_|02 it down or continue|_|04 to use|_|04 it for interrogating|_|02 supposed|_|02 terrorist|_|01 . i do have sympathy|_|03 for some of the prisoners|_|01 who may|_|01 not particularly|_|02 be terrorist|_|01 . from an article|_|04 i read|_|04 some of these prisoners|_|01 or most of them are mentally|_|01 ill|_|05 . one|_|01 thing|_|12 i learned|_|04 from this article|_|04 i read|_|04 is that some of the psychologists|_|01 may|_|01 be assisting|_|10 with torturing|_|01 the prisoners|_|01 . some believe|_|01 that some of these physicians|_|01 and psychiatrist|_|01 should bear|_|02 the brunt|_|01 of the blame|_|01 for torture|_|05 at guantanamo|_|01 bay|_|01 .
this article|_|04 is very tiring|_|02 . i am tired|_|02 of hearing|_|02 about the corruption|_|05 of politicians|_|03 . there does not seem|_|02 to be a single|_|01 good|_|07 moral|_|02 politician|_|03 . it would be impossible|_|03 to win|_|01 and position|_|01 of public|_|01 office|_|06 without corruption|_|05 . this is just another|_|01 example|_|04 of more corruption|_|05 . why do the biggest|_|05 low|_|01 files|_|03 decide|_|04 to be politicians|_|03 ? maybe|_|01 because they are the type|_|06 of people|_|01 that like|_|02 to lie|_|01 and cheat|_|01 there way|_|06 to money|_|03 and power|_|04 .
wow|_|02 .. di you see|_|10 this ? felicia|_|01 taylor|_|03 is suing|_|01 the makers|_|01 of this product|_|02 .. soft|_|01 sheen|_|01 carson|_|01 optimum|_|01 amy legend|_|01 no mix|_|03 , no lye|_|01 relaxer|_|01 . she has bald|_|01 spots|_|01 , burns|_|05 , blisters|_|03 and pain|_|04 from using|_|01 this . do you know|_|11 anyone who uses|_|01 this ? if you do have them check|_|10 out this link|_|01 . the law|_|01 suit|_|05 is for 5|_|01 million|_|01 dollars|_|02 .. maybe|_|01 they can get|_|02 some money|_|03 .. i think|_|03 it 's terrible|_|02 that this product|_|02 was allowed|_|01 to be sold|_|07 . it is awful|_|02 when someone|_|01 thinks|_|03 something would make|_|02 them look|_|02 nice|_|03 but instead|_|01 ends|_|04 up damaging|_|01 them for life|_|01 . be sure|_|04 to check|_|10 the article|_|04 out .. i think|_|03 there are some pictures|_|01 out there too . brace|_|09 yourself before you look|_|02 at them .
trump|_|02 's handling|_|01 of mexico|_|01 has been atrocious|_|03 . while illegal|_|01 immigration|_|02 may|_|01 have fallen|_|26 , it 's no reason|_|01 to treat|_|05 such a big|_|01 trading|_|01 partner|_|01 like|_|02 a second|_|01 class|_|03 world|_|02 citizen|_|01 by telling|_|07 them they have to pay|_|10 for a wall|_|07 . a wall|_|07 which would be completely|_|01 useless|_|01 as far|_|01 as keeping|_|02 people|_|01 out , because there are such things|_|09 as shovels|_|03 and boats|_|01 . it 's just completely|_|01 absurd|_|01 .
the previous|_|03 article|_|02 says|_|02 that- countless|_|01 acts|_|04 of hate|_|01 have been carried|_|23 out since trump|_|02 ’s win|_|01 — day|_|01 one|_|05 of donald trump|_|02 ’s america|_|01 came|_|02 with countless|_|01 acts|_|04 of hate|_|01 that were carried|_|23 out by his|_|01 supporters|_|01 against several|_|01 of the country|_|01 ’s most marginalized|_|01 groups|_|01 . day|_|01 two|_|01 was no different|_|01 , nor the days|_|01 following|_|19 . since election|_|02 day|_|01 , there have been more than 200|_|01 acts|_|04 of election|_|02 - related|_|04 intimidation|_|03 and harassment|_|02 across|_|02 the u.s.|_|01 , according|_|01 to a survey|_|03 by the southern|_|03 poverty|_|01 law|_|01 center|_|07 . people|_|01 from all types|_|06 of communities|_|01 ― black|_|02 , latino|_|01 , muslim|_|01 , jewish|_|01 , asian|_|01 , queer|_|01 people|_|01 , women|_|01 ― have been physically|_|01 harmed|_|01 , slandered|_|01 with hate|_|01 speech|_|02 or been the targets|_|04 of racist|_|01 graffiti|_|01 . while we should’t have to live|_|01 in fear|_|03 for our safety|_|02 , trump|_|02 supporters|_|01 feel|_|05 more emboldened|_|01 than ever|_|03 to express|_|02

i really|_|01 do n't fully|_|01 understand|_|01 what 's happening|_|04 in this article|_|04 . i get|_|01 that the players|_|05 need|_|02 sleep|_|03 and that 's about it . do you know|_|01 much|_|05 about what they 're trying|_|01 to say|_|01 here ? i have such little|_|02 knowledge|_|01 of sports|_|04 that i struggle|_|02 understanding|_|01 the lingo|_|02 associated|_|01 with the sport|_|04 . i can understand|_|01 sleep|_|03 though|_|01 !
well|_|06 well|_|06 well|_|06 , look|_|02 at what we have well|_|06 , the arrogant|_|01 kim guardianship|_|02 finally|_|01 got|_|02 what she deserves|_|01 : being robbed|_|01 for millions|_|02 , the thought|_|01 of it is bitter|_|06 , considering|_|01 it 's a robbery|_|01 after all , but think|_|01 the other way|_|06 , a rich|_|11 superfluous|_|01 gal|_|01 as kim , broadcasting|_|02 her belongings|_|01 on social|_|06 media|_|02 , i guess|_|02 she brought|_|11 this upon herself
this is a nice|_|04 little|_|08 distillation|_|01 of american|_|01 culture|_|02 . i ca|_|01 nt|_|01 criticize|_|06 the entire|_|02 thing|_|12 enough|_|01 . the shallowness|_|02 of the need|_|02 for fake|_|02 aesthetics|_|01 , the absurdity|_|02 of the legal|_|05 system|_|05 , the shoddy|_|01 products|_|04 of huge|_|01 corporations|_|07 playing|_|22 to the solipsism|_|01 of american|_|01 sheep|_|03 . it 's just another|_|01 sad|_|02 piece|_|01 of shit|_|04 . caloocan|_|01 , take|_|06 me away|_|01 .
after reading|_|08 the article|_|04 about azania banks|_|06 and russell|_|07 crow|_|01 , i must|_|01 say|_|01 it was rather|_|01 humiliating|_|01 . they treated|_|03 her really|_|01 bad|_|01 . i felt|_|03 compassion|_|02 for her . i tried|_|01 to put|_|04 myself into her shoe|_|01 and i know|_|07 i would have broken|_|02 down and cried|_|02 . she should have controlled|_|03 her tongue|_|07 as well|_|09 , violence|_|03 begot|_|01 violence|_|03 and a soft|_|09 answer|_|02 turns|_|11 away|_|10 wrath|_|02 . russell|_|07 is not much|_|01 of a lady|_|03 's gentleman|_|01 he could have dealt|_|02 with the issue|_|01 in an amicable|_|01 manner|_|03 . maybe|_|01 they could just let|_|02 bygones|_|01 be bygones|_|01 and put|_|04 it behind|_|02 them . it was rather|_|01 unfortunate|_|01 .
these people|_|03 argue|_|03 about who 's fault|_|01 it is , but in the end|_|10 , we 're just moving|_|01 down a highway|_|01 together|_|05 , that we build|_|01 together|_|05 , and all these dangerous|_|02 curves|_|03 are our own fault|_|01 . the truth|_|03 to me is , all the republican|_|01 party|_|02 did to win|_|01 was take|_|41 advantage|_|03 of disenfranchised|_|01 people|_|03 who are tired|_|02 of things|_|05 that happened|_|02 ten|_|01 years|_|03 ago|_|01 and beyond|_|03 , so they looked|_|02 to the only people|_|03 who would listen|_|02 to them , even|_|03 if they were wrong|_|02 .
it is very sad|_|02 to know|_|05 robert|_|01 died|_|01 . he was a great|_|01 actor|_|02 . you never|_|01 now when your time|_|03 is going|_|03 to come|_|04 . i get|_|01 very worried|_|01 of my own health|_|01 . there are so many|_|01 sicknesses|_|02 and diseases|_|01 . i tried|_|01 to get|_|01 checked|_|08 annually|_|01 at the doctors|_|01 . i hope|_|02 they come|_|04 out with a cure|_|02 for these diseases|_|01 and sicknesses|_|02 . i feel|_|04 like|_|02 robert|_|01 did live|_|01 kind|_|01 of a long|_|01 life|_|01 . robert|_|01 has made|_|08 good|_|01 memories|_|03 and i think|_|03 that is very important|_|05 when living|_|01 . i want|_|01 to make|_|08 a lot|_|05 of good|_|01 memories|_|03 now that i 'm alive|_|01 . everyone life|_|01 should have meaning|_|04 just like|_|02 robert|_|01 's .
i think|_|01 it 's hard|_|01 to determine|_|08 things|_|09 like|_|02 this unless the entire|_|02 program|_|07 in each community|_|01 is being monitored|_|02 . if not , the money|_|03 spent|_|03 versus the number|_|01 of children|_|01 being taught|_|02 or learning|_|08 from this process|_|06 is hard|_|01 to determine|_|08 . i do think|_|01 that connecting|_|01 the schools|_|05 is important|_|01 though|_|01 and that children|_|01 should be learning|_|08 computers|_|01 , but by the time|_|06 they 're in the workplace|_|01 , the jobs|_|11 may|_|01 have changed|_|01 .
we live|_|01 in a different|_|05 age|_|01 where millennial|_|01 are going|_|01 to be taking|_|01 over the community|_|01 shortly|_|01 within|_|02 this decade|_|01 . first|_|02 we elected|_|02 the first|_|01 african|_|01 - american|_|02 president|_|02 . now we have trump|_|02 , the most controversial|_|01 president|_|02 of all . he may|_|01 change|_|01 things|_|08 for better|_|12 or for worse|_|01 time|_|06 will tell|_|01 . hopefully|_|01 he can bring|_|05 innovation|_|02 .
i can not believe|_|01 that this happened|_|01 . i feel|_|04 so bad|_|01 for her ! can you believe|_|01 she received|_|03 threats|_|03 on twitter|_|01 ? it is cuber bullying|_|02 for sure|_|02 . i canny|_|01 imagine|_|02 this happening|_|01 to me , how scary|_|01 ! i am so sad|_|02 that she had to cancel|_|01 her account|_|05 because of crazy|_|03 people|_|03 . ugh ! i hope|_|03 that these bullies|_|02 are caught|_|19 and she can go|_|01 back|_|03 to her account|_|05 .
it 's a shame|_|01 how the government|_|03 ca|_|01 n't get|_|01 this under control|_|02 . as i 've always|_|04 said|_|01 , flint|_|03 is n't the only city|_|01 with these problems|_|01 . the worst|_|09 part|_|03 about the localities|_|01 that disregard|_|04 the lead|_|03 levels|_|07 is that either|_|01 they are fabricating|_|01 the test|_|02 results|_|02 or not being fined|_|03 at all . i just do n't see|_|01 that things|_|12 are going|_|01 to get|_|01 any better|_|13 under pruitt ( he really|_|01 needs|_|03 to resign|_|01 ) . i just ca|_|01 n't see|_|01 the epa|_|01 fining|_|02 or shutting|_|02 down water|_|01 systems|_|05 that are non|_|01 compliant|_|01 . i am terribly|_|02 worried|_|06 , not only for the children|_|01 of flint|_|03 , but for all the children|_|01 who are still|_|03 drinking|_|01 water|_|01 with high|_|07 lead|_|03 levels|_|07 .
it sounds|_|02 like|_|02 she was n't cut|_|17 out to be a cop|_|05 . the way|_|01 i see|_|05 it , it was obvious|_|01 that the guy|_|03 was compensating|_|01 in some way|_|01 , but he did n't display|_|03 anything that indicated|_|05 he was violent|_|03 - that had to all be in her head|_|01 . yes|_|01 , when the cops|_|05 order|_|13 you to do something , it 's probably|_|01 better|_|07 to comply|_|01 , especially|_|01 if they have draw|_|05 weapons|_|01 including|_|02 teasers|_|03 . no one|_|02 disputes|_|01 that his|_|01 hands|_|06 were up , and the other officer|_|01 assessed|_|01 the situation|_|03 to require|_|02 a tares|_|01 , not a gun|_|01 , and apparently|_|01 , this scenario|_|03 goes|_|02 against training|_|05 , so the problem|_|02 was in the officer|_|01 , not the victim|_|02 . people|_|03 wonder|_|01 why the police|_|01 are n't trusted|_|01 , and this is it . they 're human|_|03 too , and they make|_|43 mistakes|_|02 , but their mistakes|_|02 kill|_|01 people|_|03 unjustly|_|01 . i feel|_|05 bad|_|01 for the family|_|06 of the victim|_|02 and i hope|_|01 they see|_|05 justice|_|01 done .
wow|_|02 that dude|_|06 has a lot|_|04 of money|_|03 ! more power|_|02 to him , that 's awesome|_|02 . that guy|_|03 has worked|_|02 hard|_|01 his|_|01 whole|_|02 life|_|01 and built|_|01 an amazing|_|01 career|_|02 and he 's unstoppable|_|01 in the wrong|_|05 . so yeah|_|01 what do you guys|_|01 think|_|03 ? do you agree|_|01 that he deserves|_|01 what he 's got|_|01 ? do you think|_|03 he really|_|01 refused|_|05 to pay|_|10 for the necklace|_|01 ? or do you think|_|03 it 's just fake|_|02 news|_|04 someone|_|01 made|_|08 up ?
i am really|_|01 touched|_|08 by this story|_|03 . the rescue|_|01 just restored|_|05 my faith|_|01 in humanity|_|08 . the success|_|01 of the rescue|_|01 operation|_|07 proves|_|15 that extraordinary|_|03 things|_|12 can be achieved|_|01 with passion|_|07 and determination|_|02 . human|_|03 conflict|_|04 causes|_|02 suffering|_|11 to both human|_|03 beings and animals|_|01 . suffering|_|11 animals|_|01 should not be forgotten|_|03 or overlooked|_|01 , even|_|04 in the midst|_|01 of human|_|03 conflicts|_|04 or natural|_|04 or man|_|08 - made|_|02 disasters|_|03 . i was very touched|_|09 and encouraged|_|03 by these acts|_|02 of bravery|_|01 and care|_|04 towards animals|_|01 .
there has been more fighting|_|06 from the saudis|_|01 in nearby|_|01 yemen|_|01 . the united|_|01 states|_|01 continues|_|04 to supply|_|02 the saudis|_|01 with weapons|_|01 and intelligence|_|01 , despite|_|02 the atrocious|_|03 use|_|03 they will be put|_|04 to . these war|_|02 crimes|_|02 seem|_|04 to be increasingly|_|01 commonplace|_|01 , yet|_|03 the us|_|01 continues|_|04 to pursue|_|01 the almighty|_|01 dollar|_|03 in supporting|_|03 saudi|_|01 arabia|_|01 .
with the ever|_|01 - growing|_|01 lack|_|01 of medical|_|02 clinics|_|01 and equipment|_|01 in 3rd|_|01 world|_|08 countries|_|04 , more outbreaks|_|01 will eventually|_|01 start|_|02 and can affect|_|01 millions|_|02 of people|_|01 . this article|_|04 for example|_|07 , showed|_|02 that cholera|_|01 outbreak|_|01 in haiti|_|01 , millions|_|02 has been affected|_|01 and people|_|01 are dying|_|05 but we do n't have the resources|_|02 to help|_|01 them .
this article|_|04 was so sad|_|02 . i guess|_|02 isis|_|01 had killed|_|01 many|_|01 people|_|01 recently|_|01 in israel|_|02 . they were very rude|_|01 about it and many|_|01 people|_|01 were at high|_|01 tension|_|04 worried|_|06 they had bombs|_|05 or traps|_|07 set|_|04 up as they were recovering|_|04 and looking|_|02 for more bodies|_|01 . they said|_|01 the people|_|01 of isis|_|01 just dumped|_|02 there bodies|_|01 as if they were trash|_|02 .
this is so sad|_|01 . many|_|01 of you know|_|01 i use|_|01 to have a lab|_|01 . they are often|_|03 the most sweetest|_|07 , loving|_|01 dogs|_|02 around|_|04 . i can not imagine|_|02 why someone|_|01 would take|_|35 out a gun|_|02 and shoot|_|02 one|_|04 . this is another|_|01 example|_|01 ( there seem|_|04 to be countless|_|01 that happen|_|01 everyday|_|03 ) of why people|_|01 should not own guns|_|02 . i know|_|01 some people|_|01 will say|_|01 it is not a person|_|01 , but this is still|_|03 another|_|01 needless|_|01 murder|_|01 that occurred|_|01 because of a gun|_|02 .
i just thought|_|09 you would want|_|01 to know|_|10 my opinion|_|01 on this . we 've never|_|02 really|_|01 talked|_|01 much|_|01 about it . i feel|_|05 like|_|02 refugees|_|01 from syria|_|01 should be given|_|01 a free|_|01 shot|_|01 here in america|_|01 . we have been over there messing|_|02 with their country|_|04 . we have engaged|_|01 in war|_|01 , both indirectly|_|01 and directly|_|04 . we have been wavering|_|01 in our responsibilities|_|01 there . to be able|_|04 to simply|_|03 sit|_|01 back|_|04 here on our haunches|_|02 in america|_|01 judging|_|04 people|_|01 who are fleeing|_|01 for their lives|_|02 .. definitely|_|01 partially|_|01 because of our actions|_|10 , is wrong|_|05 . they should be welcomed|_|03 here . they should n't be treated|_|05 as terrorists|_|01 . it is important|_|01 that poor|_|01 people|_|01 who are suffering|_|09 should be welcomed|_|03 here . these are people|_|01 who would be glad|_|03 to be given|_|01 a shot|_|01 , they would work|_|03 hard|_|01 . they are family|_|08 people|_|01 , hard|_|01 workers|_|01 , many|_|01 of them are talented|_|01 a
new|_|01 data|_|01 shows|_|03 airline|_|02 discrimination|_|02 complaints|_|04 jumped|_|11 37|_|01 percent|_|01 — the transportation|_|02 department|_|03 is making|_|35 more data|_|01 available|_|03 about complaints|_|04 of racial|_|02 , ethnic|_|01 and religious|_|02 discrimination|_|02 filed|_|01 against the airlines|_|02 , the agency|_|01 said|_|11 tuesday|_|01 . the department|_|03 said|_|11 it was releasing|_|03 the data|_|01 to the public|_|02 in an attempt|_|01 to be more transparent|_|04 about such complaints|_|04 and how they are handled|_|06 .
this really|_|01 sucks|_|04 for the children|_|02 and the families|_|02 affected|_|05 . they could sue|_|01 the developers|_|01 , but no amount|_|01 of money|_|03 is going|_|01 to compensate|_|15 them for the health|_|02 issues|_|01 these kids|_|02 are going|_|01 to experience|_|01 due|_|03 to lead|_|03 poisoning|_|02 . the worst|_|12 thing|_|08 about this is , if it were a wealthy|_|01 white|_|05 neighborhood|_|04 adjacent|_|03 to the industrial|_|04 site|_|01 they wanted|_|05 to demolish|_|03 , you know|_|05 they would have taken|_|15 every|_|01 precaution|_|02 to test|_|07 to see|_|01 if there was any chance|_|01 of releasing|_|01 toxic|_|01 amounts|_|01 of lead|_|02 into the vicinity|_|01 . but it 's a poor|_|02 black|_|04 neighborhood|_|04 , so of course|_|04 they are n't as careful|_|05 .
they should really|_|01 figure|_|01 out if these earthquakes|_|02 are due|_|02 to racking|_|02 waste|_|05 water|_|02 , and if so stop|_|05 the practice|_|05 . politicians|_|03 earn’t concerned|_|02 about the plight|_|01 of the ordinary|_|02 people|_|03 though|_|01 . racking|_|02 companies|_|03 have lobbyists|_|01 and money|_|03 , while the victims|_|02 of the earthquakes|_|02 have neither|_|01 . ultimately|_|01 nothing|_|01 will get|_|02 addressed|_|05 unless something catastrophic|_|01 happens|_|04 .
i just read|_|03 an article|_|04 on the decision|_|01 this week|_|01 to dismiss|_|05 the kenyan|_|01 general|_|03 in charge|_|11 of the peacekeeping|_|01 force|_|01 there . i agree|_|05 that the restoration|_|07 of a peace|_|04 agreement|_|06 is important|_|01 and vital|_|04 in this situation|_|01 . i hope|_|03 they can figure|_|01 it out and the fighting|_|01 that is happening|_|01 all over the country|_|04 can finally|_|01 end|_|04 and they can have peace|_|04 .
there are many|_|01 red|_|03 squirrels|_|02 in great|_|03 britain|_|01 and are causing|_|02 leprosy|_|01 around|_|04 the city|_|03 a girl|_|01 who was near|_|07 the age|_|01 found|_|02 in squirrel|_|02 these have been in scotland|_|01 and great|_|03 britannia and even|_|03 in some cases|_|08 also|_|02 in but not eluding|_|01 them at all - russia|_|03 . this is a placement|_|03 and a serious|_|02 incident|_|02 as you can read|_|06 many|_|01 people|_|03 should be concerned|_|02 about this and might|_|01 turn|_|16 a line|_|03 eye|_|03 to it but something should be done about this and people|_|03 should try|_|05 to find|_|02 a cure|_|02 of some sort|_|04 for this
i can understand|_|02 being absent|_|02 minded|_|06 and concentrating|_|07 on other things|_|08 to the point|_|18 you 're so laser|_|01 focused|_|04 you forget|_|01 some small|_|01 things|_|08 around|_|01 you . but how in the hell|_|01 do you forget|_|01 your kid|_|01 is in the backseat|_|02 of the car|_|04 , much|_|04 less|_|02 come|_|01 back|_|05 to the car|_|04 hours|_|04 later|_|01 and still|_|04 not see|_|02 the kid|_|01 in there . it makes|_|43 no sense|_|02 , it 's hard|_|07 to believe|_|03 the guy|_|03 did it on purpose|_|01 , but it 's hard|_|07 to believe|_|03 he did n't remember|_|01 him twice|_|01 . really|_|01 sad|_|02 and tragic|_|01 .
just another|_|01 case|_|01 of police|_|01 brutality|_|01 , not surprising|_|01 at all this is a massive|_|04 problem|_|01 in our country|_|01 , usually|_|01 its the black|_|12 population|_|04 on the receiving|_|13 end|_|05 of it , but it does effect|_|05 other people|_|01 as well|_|01 . when is this going|_|01 to stop|_|01 ? seems|_|02 like|_|02 it never|_|02 is going|_|01 to end|_|01 , its been going|_|01 on since the beginning|_|01 of law|_|01 enforcement|_|01 , and will continue|_|01 . its shameful|_|12
did you hear|_|02 about what happened|_|01 in afghanistan|_|01 ? there were civilian|_|01 and military|_|03 deaths|_|01 during battles|_|01 with the taliban|_|01 . i can not imagine|_|02 what the afghan|_|01 family|_|08 members|_|01 are going|_|04 through or what the families|_|08 of the americans|_|01 here are going|_|04 through . it is such a great|_|03 loss|_|01 . this war|_|04 has got|_|04 to end|_|01 soon|_|01 . i know|_|01 that the us|_|01 troops|_|04 are just trying|_|05 to help|_|05 the afghans|_|01 but there are so many|_|01 things|_|01 that go|_|04 on during these battles|_|01 . i pray|_|01 an end|_|06 comes|_|04 soon|_|01 .
there is a lot|_|02 going|_|03 on in this one|_|05 and i had lots|_|02 of different|_|01 emotions|_|01 throughout|_|01 the whole|_|01 thing|_|01 . numerous|_|01 issues|_|02 with the article|_|02 i read|_|06 , cops|_|01 shooting|_|01 people|_|01 , people|_|01 being sent|_|02 to prison|_|02 for far|_|04 too long|_|01 of a period|_|01 of time|_|01 , as well|_|02 as militias|_|02 being formed|_|03 to protect|_|02 land|_|04 . i feel|_|05 our land|_|04 is important|_|05 , i feel|_|05 as though|_|01 cattle|_|01 should be able|_|02 to graze|_|04 and that we have a huge|_|01 problem|_|01 when it comes|_|04 to economic|_|04 issues|_|02 , due|_|03 to the way|_|09 that livestock|_|01 is taken|_|06 care|_|02 of , to produce|_|04 food|_|02 for people|_|01 . it is heartbreaking|_|02 to see|_|01 people|_|01 fight|_|03 for land|_|04 they love|_|01 it , and it ’s heartbreaking|_|02 for the police|_|01 to have to shoot|_|01 people|_|01 over it . people|_|01 lose|_|07 years|_|03 of their lives|_|01 in prison|_|02 over land|_|04 and cattle|_|01 and thousands|_|01 upon thousands|_|01 of dollars|_|03 wasted|_|10 in court|_|08 cases|_|06 . the whole|_|01 article|_|02 was a mess|_|02 !
as it turns|_|20 out , male|_|03 models|_|01 do not make|_|08 as much|_|01 as their female|_|02 counterparts|_|02 . i was not aware|_|01 this was the case|_|09 . the reasoning|_|03 seems|_|03 to be that male|_|03 models|_|01 have a longer|_|01 career|_|02 , whereas women|_|02 are considered|_|05 going|_|01 downward|_|01 after thirty|_|01 . the gap|_|01 in pay|_|01 between them is quite|_|02 high|_|01 . some people|_|01 are doing their best|_|03 to split|_|09 the wages|_|01 more fairly|_|03 , but it appears|_|02 to be the default|_|02 to pay|_|10 women|_|02 more in this industry|_|02 . i think|_|03 more men|_|01 are paying|_|10 attention|_|03 to their grooming|_|01 habits|_|05 . i hope|_|02 that men|_|01 will earn|_|08 more fair|_|07 wages|_|01 in the future|_|03 .
it is very upsetting|_|01 to hear|_|02 about a family|_|02 losing|_|03 their children|_|02 in such a freak|_|01 accident|_|01 way|_|10 . as a parent|_|01 myself i can only imagine|_|02 the horrible|_|03 feelings|_|04 that this family|_|02 is going|_|01 through and how everyone must|_|01 be feeling|_|13 right|_|07 now to lose|_|03 these little|_|08 girls|_|02 as such a young|_|01 age|_|01 . no one|_|01 should have to bury|_|03 their own children|_|02 , it is just terrible|_|01 .
it is really|_|01 sad|_|02 how many|_|01 millions|_|01 of people|_|01 are led|_|03 astray|_|03 from the truth|_|05 of the bible|_|01 . when people|_|01 are exposed|_|02 to hatred|_|01 all their lives|_|05 , it 's very easy|_|12 for them to become|_|01 extremists|_|01 . this suicide|_|02 bomber|_|03 in pakistan|_|01 is one|_|01 of the sickest|_|01 out there . people|_|01 with no fear|_|03 of death|_|01 and who think|_|10 they 're actually|_|02 going|_|03 to be rewarded|_|03 in the afterlife|_|01 for killing|_|01 innocent|_|01 people|_|01 ? how stupid|_|01 !
reading|_|06 stuff|_|05 like|_|02 this puts|_|07 the refugee|_|01 in perspective|_|03 . there has to be something the international|_|01 community|_|01 can do that is n't taking|_|06 in refugees|_|01 permanently|_|01 . the vast|_|01 majority|_|03 of these people|_|03 just want|_|01 to live|_|01 and build|_|03 something for themselves . it is of no fault|_|05 of their own that they were unfortunate|_|03 enough|_|01 to be born|_|03 within|_|02 the fist|_|01 of a crazed|_|01 dictator|_|02 .
" hey , man|_|08 , do n't know|_|01 if you saw|_|01 this report|_|03 on the news|_|02 , but this article|_|04 is pretty|_|01 messed|_|02 up . those poor|_|06 people|_|01 were just trying|_|01 to have a good|_|13 time|_|02 and then all hell|_|04 broke|_|02 lose|_|06 . i remember|_|07 seeing|_|01 the news|_|02 reports|_|03 and the images|_|01 were pretty|_|01 shocking|_|03 , but the story|_|03 in this article|_|04 takes|_|06 it to another|_|01 level|_|07 . you should read|_|06 it . these poor|_|06 people|_|01 are going|_|01 to get|_|01 paid|_|07 for sure|_|07 . it is funny|_|02 how the owner|_|02 had to invoke|_|02 " " god|_|03 " " trying|_|01 to protect|_|02 his|_|01 own ass . "
seems|_|02 like|_|02 so many|_|01 tragic|_|01 accidents|_|02 have been happening|_|01 lately|_|01 . i just read|_|03 another|_|01 article|_|04 about the tragic|_|01 death|_|04 of a father|_|01 son|_|02 that took|_|27 place|_|01 during a hike|_|09 . the both of them fell|_|08 off a cliff|_|01 and died|_|03 recently|_|01 while exploring|_|02 the outdoors|_|01 . there was an attempt|_|01 made|_|01 to recover|_|04 their bodies|_|01 but the exact|_|01 cause|_|01 was not specified|_|01 . poor|_|01 souls|_|01 . i pray|_|01 that their family|_|01 may|_|01 be given|_|09 strength|_|01 as they discover|_|02 the tragedy|_|02 .
this article|_|02 about people|_|01 targeting|_|01 muslims|_|01 is sickening|_|04 . one|_|06 lady|_|03 's clothes|_|01 were set|_|12 on fire|_|08 ! who does that ? ! another|_|01 lady|_|03 was with her 15|_|01 month|_|02 old|_|01 child|_|04 and was punched|_|03 in the face|_|01 :( it makes|_|18 me so sick|_|01 that hate|_|01 going|_|01 on in today|_|01 world|_|08 . i understand|_|03 that there are terrorists|_|01 and some are muslims|_|01 . but that does not mean|_|04 we should say|_|01 that every|_|02 muslim|_|01 should pay|_|10 the price|_|06 .
the first|_|01 article|_|04 never|_|02 appeared|_|02 , there was only a generic|_|03 place|_|07 holders|_|03 and nothing|_|01 to write|_|10 about . i answered|_|01 questions|_|06 about my emotions|_|01 based|_|01 on how i feel|_|05 right|_|01 now and i 'm writing|_|10 this to explain|_|02 that the article|_|04 was n't there . i hope|_|03 that the following|_|10 articles|_|04 will appear|_|02 and i 'll be able|_|04 to finish|_|01 this survey|_|03 as intended|_|01 .
hey , i saw|_|01 your post|_|09 about people|_|03 harming|_|01 the environment|_|02 and i definitely|_|01 agree|_|01 with you . just take|_|35 a look|_|02 at this article|_|04 - it talks|_|02 about how foods|_|03 are being wasted|_|10 and it can potentially|_|01 harm|_|01 the environment|_|02 . since so many|_|01 people|_|03 do not care|_|02 about the environment|_|02 or do not know|_|01 the effects|_|02 of harming|_|01 the environment|_|02 , how about you and see|_|01 set|_|02 up some program|_|02 that would help|_|05 improve|_|02 the environment|_|02 ?
how can they do this to these people|_|01 ? did you see|_|01 this ? how can you move|_|07 people|_|01 who were fleeing|_|01 war|_|01 and violence|_|03 to another|_|01 place|_|01 after they had already|_|01 settled|_|01 there ? it 's unbelievable|_|01 , i feel|_|06 so sorry|_|01 for these people|_|01 , and someone|_|01 needs|_|02 to step|_|02 in and help|_|05 them stay|_|04 where they are currently|_|02 comfortable|_|02 .
hey , here 's another|_|01 article|_|04 that i 'm sending|_|02 to you for no good|_|20 reason|_|03 , since neither|_|01 of us|_|01 are interested|_|01 in this kind|_|01 of thing|_|09 . it looks|_|02 like|_|02 more people|_|03 died|_|06 for shitty|_|01 reasons|_|03 , but maybe|_|01 some are still|_|01 alive|_|01 . and , if there 's anything that people|_|03 love|_|02 , it 's the idea|_|01 that things|_|09 can be ok|_|01 and / or get|_|02 better|_|20 . people|_|03 fucking|_|01 love|_|02 this stuff|_|06 . but , i did think|_|03 that the bit|_|05 about a hen|_|04 being rescued|_|02 was out of place|_|01 . aha . so , what do you think|_|03 ?
the author|_|01 of this article|_|02 i read|_|05 examined|_|01 several|_|01 cases|_|06 in which youth|_|06 were killed|_|01 in gun|_|02 violence|_|01 on the same day|_|05 . they used|_|04 the personal|_|01 stories|_|01 of a couple|_|01 of people|_|01 to show|_|12 how the ready|_|01 availability|_|02 of guns|_|02 contributes|_|03 to sad|_|02 situations|_|02 in which kids|_|01 are shot|_|04 and killed|_|01 . it was n't as well|_|01 written|_|01 as a lot|_|05 of journalism|_|02 in this area|_|01 , but it was pretty|_|01 interesting|_|01 to hear|_|02 the stories|_|01 of the two|_|01 cases|_|06 that were detailed|_|02 . one|_|05 involved|_|01 a violent|_|02 adult|_|01 who went|_|01 on a rampage|_|01 and shot|_|05 an ex|_|02 - girlfriend|_|02 's child|_|01 and another|_|01 person|_|01 . the other story|_|01 involved|_|01 two|_|01 kids|_|01 who were left|_|12 alone|_|02 in a home|_|01 that had a lot|_|05 of guns|_|02 and one|_|05 of them ended|_|03 up shooting|_|07 and killing|_|01 the other , claiming|_|05 it was an accident|_|01 . the author|_|01 concludes|_|04 by calling|_|02 for more active|_|04 challenges|_|04 to the nra|_|01 and the second|_|01 amendment|_|02
it 's so sad|_|02 to see|_|01 that world|_|08 hunger|_|01 is still|_|01 such a large|_|01 issue|_|01 in other countries|_|04 , especially|_|01 when it seems|_|04 like|_|02 so much|_|01 of our food|_|03 goes|_|01 to waste|_|10 . children|_|02 passing|_|01 out in the streets|_|03 simply|_|04 because they have no food|_|03 to eat|_|06 is heartbreaking|_|02 . no one|_|01 should have to suffer|_|10 simply|_|04 because they ca|_|01 n't afford|_|03 food|_|03 . there needs|_|02 to be another|_|01 option|_|02 .
" once again , another|_|01 group|_|01 of innocent|_|07 people|_|01 negatively|_|02 impacted|_|01 by this buffoon|_|02 and his|_|01 horrific|_|01 policies|_|02 and his|_|01 agenda|_|02 . it still|_|03 floors|_|01 me that this immoral|_|01 idiot|_|01 is now the president|_|01 of the united|_|05 states|_|04 . i 've lost|_|05 all respect|_|03 for our government|_|02 and the government|_|02 " " officials|_|02 " " who run|_|14 our country|_|04 . "
it is sad|_|02 that they can not stop|_|05 poaching|_|01 . all wildlife|_|01 deserves|_|01 an equal|_|01 chance|_|01 to live|_|05 freely|_|01 on this earth|_|01 . they should not be hunted|_|01 down as trophies|_|01 . i feel|_|04 pleased|_|02 that the security|_|02 forces|_|04 are trying|_|01 to protect|_|02 wildlife|_|01 . i am also|_|02 happy|_|02 that rhino|_|01 poaching|_|01 is a crime|_|02 that will help|_|01 to protect|_|02 the noncancerous . it hurts|_|06 to know|_|05 they hunt|_|01 the animals|_|01 just for their horns|_|09 . that is sheer|_|04 cruelty|_|02 , not because they can not talk|_|02 but they do have feelings|_|04 and should be allowed|_|01 to live|_|05 wild|_|01 and free|_|01 .
you ca|_|01 n't sleep|_|02 too much|_|01 or too little|_|02 . what else|_|03 is new|_|05 . i 'm sure|_|07 there will be a high|_|07 priced|_|01 drug|_|01 that can solve|_|01 this issue|_|05 . the scientists|_|01 and government|_|01 of america|_|01 could n't care|_|02 less|_|02 about the average|_|01 citizen|_|01 . look|_|02 at the food|_|03 supply|_|02 , look|_|03 at all of the drugs|_|01 they want|_|05 us|_|01 to take|_|06 . it 's all about money|_|03 and has nothing|_|01 to do with concern|_|04 for our well|_|05 - being .
i think|_|03 that global|_|01 warming|_|09 is definitely|_|01 a very real|_|03 thing|_|11 that is occurring|_|03 today|_|01 and i feel|_|04 like|_|02 it is sad|_|02 that there are still|_|04 people|_|03 who try|_|01 to deny|_|03 the fact|_|01 that it is a very real|_|03 thing|_|11 . sometimes|_|01 i feel|_|04 like|_|02 the people|_|03 that disagree|_|01 with scientists|_|01 and real|_|03 evidence|_|03 that global|_|01 warming|_|09 is very obvious|_|01 today|_|01 is just very ignorant|_|03 and live|_|09 in a bubble|_|01 where they think|_|03 that everything is fine|_|01 in the world|_|03 and everyone is at peace|_|02 . there are so many|_|01 reasons|_|06 why we should be using|_|01 fewer resources|_|03 as it is constantly|_|02 destroying|_|04 our environment|_|02 and it is unfortunate|_|03 that there are people|_|03 who just continue|_|02 to deplete|_|05 our resources|_|03 without a care|_|02 in the world|_|03 . maybe|_|01 the effects|_|05 wo n't be felt|_|03 as much|_|04 in our generation|_|01 but i am sure|_|02 that the effects|_|05 will be felt|_|03 by those others after us|_|01 sadly|_|02 .

those poor|_|02 little|_|08 babies|_|03 . this is just going|_|03 to keep|_|04 happening|_|01 more and more . the rate|_|04 of human|_|02 caused|_|01 extinctions|_|06 is going|_|03 up at a scary|_|01 rate|_|04 . i know|_|05 pandas|_|01 and polar|_|01 bears|_|02 are kind|_|01 of the face|_|07 of conservation|_|03 , but they 're not the only cute|_|01 animals|_|01 out there . and even|_|01 the ones|_|01 that are n't cuties matter|_|01 ! extinction|_|06 is such a huge|_|01 , huge|_|01 deal|_|06 .
another|_|01 article|_|04 i read|_|06 showing|_|10 a death|_|08 of african|_|01 american|_|01 driver|_|05 by a police|_|01 . i really|_|01 upset|_|01 me reading|_|06 this article|_|04 . that unnecessary|_|01 force|_|04 was used|_|06 to handle|_|02 the situation|_|01 . its crazy|_|01 that the first|_|06 thing|_|11 on the police|_|01 mind|_|07 is to shoot|_|18 to kill|_|01 . i feel|_|06 uneasy|_|02 every|_|01 time|_|01 seeing|_|08 and reading|_|06 about situation|_|01 like|_|04 this where a situation|_|01 could of been handled|_|02 in a different|_|03 way|_|11 . understandable|_|01 that they work|_|14 in a high|_|02 intense|_|03 environment|_|01 but that why they train|_|09 and follow|_|01 protocol|_|03 .
it 's interesting|_|01 that hughes|_|04 was denied|_|03 entrance|_|03 at first|_|02 - he had claimed|_|05 that muslim|_|01 guards|_|01 worked|_|19 with the terrorists|_|01 , but later|_|01 retracted|_|01 that and apologized|_|02 . might|_|01 have been a bigoted|_|01 knee|_|01 jerk|_|01 reaction|_|07 . it is nice|_|03 that these bands|_|05 came|_|03 back|_|05 to honor|_|02 those lost|_|07 in the attack|_|09 . i bet|_|02 it was very emotional|_|06 to be there .
hello|_|01 , i read|_|06 the article|_|04 , and i feel|_|05 like|_|04 they both have reasons|_|06 for feeling|_|05 the way|_|04 they do , if russel was offended|_|01 and felt|_|03 like|_|04 she was a threat|_|02 he could have called|_|09 for management|_|02 or someone|_|01 from the crew|_|03 to remove|_|01 her , he should not have attempted|_|01 a hostile|_|05 removal|_|01 . she had to have been upset|_|01 by russell|_|01 's rude|_|01 comment|_|01 , and i think|_|01 that was a hurtful|_|01 comment|_|01 regarding|_|05 her career|_|01 . i do feel|_|05 bad|_|01 for her regarding|_|05 how she was treated|_|08 .
tigers|_|02 are truly|_|01 majestic|_|01 creatures|_|03 , and it 's a shame|_|01 that their numbers|_|01 are decreasing|_|02 . india|_|01 can not fight|_|06 this battle|_|01 on its own . the poachers|_|03 sell|_|07 to international|_|03 buyers|_|01 , so the governments|_|02 of other countries|_|04 should step|_|01 in and help|_|01 the indian|_|01 people|_|01 combat|_|01 these poachers|_|03 . there should be a negative|_|06 stigma|_|04 on using|_|01 any products|_|01 made|_|02 with tiger|_|02 parts|_|01 so that people|_|01 would feel|_|01 ashamed|_|01 to contribute|_|03 to this sordid|_|02 smuggling|_|01 trade|_|01 .
hey just wanted|_|01 to share|_|01 this article|_|01 with you and let|_|02 you know|_|01 some thoughts|_|01 / feelings|_|01 about it . i know|_|01 that we have talked|_|01 before about the importance|_|02 of vaccinations|_|01 , and if it is safe|_|02 for kids|_|01 to get|_|01 them . i think|_|13 this story|_|03 really|_|01 made|_|02 me think|_|13 about that and brought|_|11 fourth|_|01 some really|_|01 interesting|_|05 facts|_|03 and data|_|01 that make|_|02 you see|_|05 how it is changing|_|02 and hurting|_|02 different|_|01 parts|_|01 of the world|_|03 . i feel|_|05 that kids|_|01 should receive|_|02 these vaccinations|_|01 as they are a easy|_|01 way|_|12 to help|_|08 and protect|_|02 people|_|01 all over the world|_|03 rather|_|02 than taking|_|15 a risk|_|04 .
these actresses|_|01 and actors|_|02 have tons|_|01 of money|_|01 . if they really|_|01 wanted|_|01 to do the right|_|08 thing|_|11 , they certainly|_|01 could , for their only son|_|02 . they are just selfish|_|01 people|_|01 , wanting|_|01 what they want|_|01 and unwilling|_|02 to compromise|_|01 with each other . most actors|_|02 and actresses|_|01 are like|_|02 that . they are so self|_|01 - centered|_|01 . i ca|_|01 n’t stand|_|12 people|_|01 like|_|02 that . i feel|_|05 sorry|_|01 for the poor|_|02 kid|_|02 . although he will probably|_|01 grow|_|01 up to be a self|_|01 - absorbed|_|01 , selfish|_|01 brat|_|03 , just like|_|02 his|_|01 parents|_|01 . i swear|_|01 that i think|_|05 the less|_|03 people|_|01 have , the better|_|20 off they treat|_|05 their children|_|02 and their families|_|02 . i have no sympathy|_|02 for people|_|01 like|_|02 these rich|_|11 snobby|_|02 people|_|01 . they probably|_|01 have their own jets|_|07 , tons|_|01 of money|_|01 . yet|_|01 , they still|_|01 ca|_|01 n’t compromise|_|01 . i wish|_|02 people|_|01 like|_|02 this would get|_|24 a grip|_|01 and i wish|_|02 the media|_|02 would stop|_|01 reporting|_|03
so many|_|01 politicians|_|03 do n't see|_|01 how serious|_|01 global|_|01 warming|_|02 is and refuse|_|01 to do anything about it . i 'm not the biggest|_|01 environmentalist|_|01 and sometimes|_|01 i ignore|_|04 the whole|_|01 climate|_|02 change|_|03 thing|_|08 , but i do believe|_|01 it is happening|_|03 and know|_|03 that our government|_|02 needs|_|02 to do something about it . i have no faith|_|02 in our current|_|01 government|_|02 to do anything , but i hope|_|03 others around|_|04 the world|_|03 will and we as individuals|_|01 can do something , even|_|01 little|_|08 things|_|08 . maybe|_|01 doing things|_|08 collaboratively can help|_|01 change|_|01 things|_|08 for the better|_|13 .
can you believe|_|05 that these women|_|01 have to endure|_|03 this ? ? i am so thankful|_|01 that they are standing|_|03 up for themselves and trying|_|01 to regain|_|01 some of their rights|_|04 . it is crazy|_|03 that things|_|09 like|_|02 this still|_|01 go|_|01 on in this world|_|08 . i stand|_|03 in support|_|10 of these brave|_|03 ladies|_|03 and i hope|_|02 that no undue|_|03 harm|_|01 is caused|_|02 to them .
i felt|_|03 sad|_|02 that the turtles|_|01 are fading|_|03 because of the habitat|_|01 temperature|_|02 rising|_|02 annually|_|01 . we , as humans|_|02 can help|_|01 i think|_|01 by trying|_|01 to not contribute|_|08 to the increase|_|05 of carbon|_|01 dioxide|_|01 consumption|_|03 , we can stop|_|01 global|_|01 warming|_|01 and try|_|01 to help|_|01 t he sea|_|03 turtles|_|01 from going|_|01 extinct|_|03 and so our children|_|03 and grandchildren|_|01 can see|_|01 them in the future|_|03 .
it is very difficult|_|02 for me to imagine|_|02 how any person|_|01 could leave|_|04 a baby|_|03 in a shoe|_|02 box|_|10 . i just do n't understand|_|02 how you could even|_|01 leave|_|04 a baby|_|03 alone|_|02 . thank|_|01 god|_|03 the baby|_|03 was in good|_|13 health|_|02 , at least|_|01 whoever left|_|04 the poor|_|01 thing|_|08 seems|_|04 to have taken|_|05 good|_|13 care|_|06 of it other than leaving|_|04 it in a shoe|_|02 box|_|10 . maybe|_|01 in the end|_|08 this will turn|_|10 out to be a good|_|13 thing|_|08 for this baby|_|03 , one|_|02 can only hope|_|03 .
what a legend|_|01 , am i right|_|04 friend|_|05 . i have never|_|02 really|_|01 got|_|01 into leonard|_|01 cohan|_|01 much|_|01 but i realize|_|08 hard|_|01 work|_|02 when i see|_|01 it . this man|_|08 is a legend|_|01 in his|_|01 own rights|_|01 . books|_|05 , poetry|_|02 books|_|05 while still|_|01 an undergraduate|_|01 . this man|_|08 did it all . did you know|_|05 he was afraid|_|04 to sing|_|05 really|_|01 and hated|_|02 being in front|_|04 of all the people|_|03 at first|_|01 but obviously|_|01 he got|_|01 over it eventually|_|01 . that makes|_|03 him so repeatable|_|01 towards me . i feel|_|06 pretty|_|01 sympathetic|_|02 towards the family|_|04 , they lost|_|07 a great|_|02 man|_|08 . i am glad|_|01 he made|_|03 so much|_|01 music|_|03 cause|_|02 his|_|01 stuff|_|01 will live|_|05 on forever|_|01 . hats|_|02 why i wanted|_|01 to be a rock|_|02 star|_|01 , to live|_|05 on after i die|_|05 .
man|_|01 how sad|_|02 , that is terrible|_|01 to imagine|_|02 what the poor|_|06 dog|_|03 went|_|01 through . i do n't think|_|02 we should hate|_|01 the guy|_|01 too much|_|01 , even|_|01 though|_|01 he should definitely|_|01 face|_|02 consequences|_|01 . ultimately|_|01 i am sure|_|01 he 's really|_|01 heart|_|03 broken|_|59 about what happened|_|01 to the dog|_|03 , and it was just a mistake|_|02 not like|_|01 some neglectful|_|02 , hateful|_|02 act|_|02 .
hate|_|01 seems|_|04 to be increasing|_|01 in this country|_|04 . i just read|_|06 an article|_|04 that hate|_|01 crimes|_|01 are going|_|16 up . i do n't know|_|07 what 's going|_|16 on but people|_|01 ca|_|01 n't seem|_|04 to handle|_|02 themselves and use|_|01 restraint|_|06 . people|_|01 are becoming|_|01 too short|_|01 - fused|_|02 and trigger|_|03 happy|_|04 on attacking|_|05 others with hate|_|01 crimes|_|01 . i hope|_|02 things|_|01 get|_|01 better|_|01 but the article|_|04 did n't seem|_|04 too optimistic|_|01 . i guess|_|02 the more we talk|_|03 about this kind|_|01 of stuff|_|04 the better|_|13 so it does n't get|_|01 ignored|_|01 . it 's an important|_|01 issue|_|04 .
i think|_|02 the robbers|_|01 probably|_|01 knew|_|11 that jewelry|_|01 would be harder|_|11 to get|_|01 away|_|01 with because in order|_|13 to make|_|03 money|_|03 selling|_|01 it , they could be tracked|_|05 and found|_|01 out that they were her pieces|_|01 . it makes|_|03 more sense|_|01 to steal|_|02 money|_|03 and they probably|_|01 thought|_|02 she would have a lot|_|02 considering|_|05 she is a huge|_|01 celebrity|_|01 . they must|_|01 not have bothered|_|01 to think|_|02 that she probably|_|01 would n't have cash|_|01 . i feel|_|05 bad|_|01 that she went|_|01 through that .
isis|_|01 is a group|_|01 of deeply|_|01 mentally|_|01 ill|_|03 serial|_|03 killers|_|01 . i simply|_|01 do n't see|_|02 them the way|_|11 i see|_|02 al|_|01 - daedalus|_|01 . now , al|_|01 - daedalus|_|01 is also|_|02 a group|_|01 of mentally|_|01 ill|_|03 people|_|01 and they 're also|_|02 disgusting|_|02 but they 're damn|_|03 serious|_|01 in their mission|_|04 . isis|_|01 feels|_|02 like|_|02 a group|_|01 of guys|_|03 who kill|_|01 just for fun|_|03 . i agree|_|07 with obama on isis|_|01 being a jv|_|01 team|_|01 . i ca|_|01 n't help|_|01 but feel|_|05 terrible|_|01 for those who have to witness|_|02 the bodies|_|01 all over mosul|_|01 . what a horrible|_|03 sight|_|02 that must|_|01 be . can people|_|01 heal|_|02 once they see|_|02 that ? do those people|_|01 have any hope|_|02 or any way|_|11 to continue|_|10 after they witness|_|02 such atrocities|_|02 ? what about the children|_|01 ? i feel|_|05 so bad|_|09 for them . it 's so crazy|_|05 . i wish|_|04 they would wipe|_|01 out the middle|_|03 east|_|05 and just start|_|03 over . enough|_|02 with the political|_|03 correct|_|01 bullshit|_|01 . enough|_|02 with the religious|_|04 bullshit|_|01 .
can you believe|_|01 they 're doing this ? kicking|_|02 people|_|03 out of their homes|_|09 to expand|_|01 a stupid|_|01 airport|_|01 ? screw|_|04 these guys|_|03 . what do you think|_|01 ? personally|_|05 , i 'm upset|_|01 and i 'm starting|_|09 a petition|_|01 . please|_|02 sign|_|01 it if you 're against this issue|_|02 like|_|02 i am . it 's absolutely|_|01 ridiculous|_|03 and should never|_|02 happen|_|01 , so there you go|_|01
i ca|_|01 nt|_|01 believe|_|01 how some countries|_|04 treat|_|08 criminals|_|01 . i agree|_|01 that they should be punished|_|01 and face|_|01 consequences|_|02 but beating|_|01 them to death|_|06 is definitely|_|01 excessive|_|02 especially|_|01 when the crime|_|01 is not that bad|_|09 . i 'm not sure|_|04 how that helps|_|01 the crime|_|01 rates|_|04 and i definitely|_|01 font|_|01 think|_|10 we should consider|_|01 that method|_|01 where we come|_|04 from .
how to deal|_|02 with that burning|_|01 question|_|06 of what is murder|_|01 before birth|_|05 and what is n't ? is it murder|_|01 because it was against your will ? maybe|_|01 that is how it should be determined|_|02 if you walk|_|01 into an abortion|_|01 clinic|_|03 you 're willingly|_|01 killing|_|01 the fetus|_|01 versus someone|_|01 shooting|_|02 you and your fetus|_|01 is now unwillingly|_|01 dead|_|01 because it was n't your choice|_|02 ?
" it does seem|_|04 a little|_|01 disrespectful|_|01 when someone|_|01 starts|_|08 to deface|_|01 any public|_|01 property|_|01 . it is a disgrace|_|02 and a lack|_|01 of moral|_|01 character|_|03 when something like|_|02 this happens|_|01 . no one|_|01 in their right|_|04 mind|_|01 would think|_|03 of doing this could it could land|_|06 you in jail|_|01 for starters|_|07 . secondly|_|01 , you could get|_|02 sued|_|01 and in today|_|02 's litigious|_|01 society|_|03 you could go|_|02 broke|_|02 rather|_|01 quick|_|04 , even|_|02 with a good|_|17 lawyer|_|01 . i guess|_|02 that 's why we have laws|_|03 . not only to protect|_|02 the public|_|02 , whether it be people|_|01 or " " spaces|_|08 " " because everyone is supposed|_|02 to be allowed|_|01 to enjoy|_|02 the public|_|01 domain|_|02 . "
i have such tender|_|01 feelings|_|02 for all these poor|_|01 women|_|02 that are being raped|_|07 . american|_|01 women|_|02 are freaking|_|01 out left|_|01 and right|_|12 about such minor|_|10 things|_|05 when we have these poor|_|01 women|_|02 being raped|_|07 and tortured|_|02 for no reason|_|02 at all other than who they affiliate|_|01 with . this stuff|_|05 is so ridiculous|_|03 and it adds|_|02 such a mysterious|_|02 cloak|_|02 to it because western|_|03 journalists|_|01 are n't really|_|01 allowed|_|01 in myanmar|_|01 . it just seems|_|04 other wordy|_|01 that all this violence|_|01 and just chaos|_|04 is going|_|03 on . not really|_|01 even|_|03 that far|_|05 away|_|02 , sure|_|07 it 's the other side|_|10 of the planet|_|02 but these crimes|_|02 and disrespect|_|02 of human|_|03 rights|_|01 is happening|_|01 one|_|05 way|_|11 or another|_|01 . what would you do in the situation|_|03 if you were one|_|05 of the innocent|_|07 people|_|01 stuck|_|01 in the middle|_|03 of it ?
this is definitely|_|01 an upsetting|_|03 thing|_|01 that has happened|_|03 . we like|_|02 to think|_|03 that when we go|_|04 to a theme|_|01 park|_|02 , all the rides|_|02 are completely|_|01 safe|_|02 and maintained|_|04 well|_|01 . but there is always|_|04 a risk|_|02 , however|_|01 small|_|08 , that something tragic|_|01 could happen|_|03 . even|_|01 in a safe|_|02 environment|_|02 like|_|02 a well|_|01 - maintained|_|04 park|_|02 , we need|_|03 to keep|_|02 up our guard|_|01 and use|_|01 good|_|13 judgment|_|01 .
that kirk|_|01 guy|_|03 seems|_|02 like|_|02 a real|_|04 loser|_|04 . how can you lie|_|06 about your military|_|03 history|_|04 and still|_|04 get|_|14 to serve|_|01 as a politician|_|02 . than to attack|_|05 somebody|_|01 that you do n't even|_|01 know|_|01 the facts|_|03 about that person|_|01 especially|_|01 when they have made|_|03 sacrifices|_|04 for their country|_|01 . so what if somebody|_|01 was born|_|03 somewhere|_|01 else|_|03 . if they have put|_|11 their time|_|06 and heart|_|01 into a place|_|01 that place|_|01 is their home|_|07 .
we live|_|05 in a world|_|01 someone|_|01 can not only be arrested|_|01 for their thoughts|_|01 , but can be seen|_|01 as a target|_|01 for violence|_|03 from monsters|_|05 . from the shooter|_|02 , to the local|_|03 government|_|02 , these actions|_|01 should be condemned|_|04 on all fronts|_|04 . the government|_|02 was wrong|_|01 to arrest|_|01 the deceased|_|01 , and the murderer|_|01 was of course|_|02 wrong|_|01 for shooting|_|03 him to death|_|01 . i am saddened|_|02 that someone|_|01 lost|_|06 his|_|01 life|_|03 because of his|_|01 charge|_|02 of a charged|_|02 message|_|02 . while i do feel|_|06 glad|_|03 that apparent|_|01 justice|_|02 will be served|_|01 in this case|_|06 , this just goes|_|02 to show|_|01 you how violent|_|02 some people|_|01 can become|_|01 when you toss|_|01 religious|_|02 ideals|_|01 into the mix|_|03 .
there has been uprisings|_|02 in ethiopia|_|01 . looks|_|03 like|_|02 many|_|01 people|_|03 are n't happy|_|01 with the industrialization|_|01 and foreign|_|02 investments|_|03 taking|_|01 place|_|01 there . people|_|03 had axes|_|01 and sounded|_|01 like|_|02 a pretty|_|01 serious|_|01 event|_|02 that may|_|01 continue|_|02 . foreign|_|02 investors|_|01 are taking|_|01 notice|_|01 and may|_|01 rethink|_|01 their investments|_|03 there or in the future|_|03 . really|_|01 do n't think|_|01 of foreign|_|02 investments|_|03 in ethiopia|_|01 but i guess|_|02 there is .
this kind|_|01 of stuff|_|01 always|_|01 makes|_|08 me afraid|_|02 to even|_|03 go|_|01 outside|_|02 . if there is something to catch|_|26 someone|_|01 will just bring|_|11 it to others and it is just something that is horrible|_|03 and not what i would want|_|05 to put|_|07 onto others . it makes|_|08 me afraid|_|02 that it could spread|_|09 and would make|_|08 things|_|08 worse|_|01 for everyone and drive|_|10 others to panic|_|02 .
i just read|_|02 this article|_|04 about how isis|_|01 are doing dehumanizing|_|02 acts|_|04 upon former|_|03 law|_|03 officials|_|02 . it disgusts|_|02 me how they do what they do and are not being stopped|_|01 . i believe|_|01 that every|_|02 nation|_|04 in the world|_|01 should rise|_|01 up and stand|_|08 against isis|_|01 . they should no longer|_|01 be able|_|04 to continue|_|06 to do what they do on a daily|_|01 basis|_|02 .
this is messed|_|02 up . burma|_|01 ’s government|_|02 is a joke|_|01 . they are so corrupt|_|01 . they basically|_|01 slaughtered|_|01 their own citizens|_|01 . i feel|_|08 for those displaced|_|02 families|_|01 . it ’s definitely|_|01 a scary|_|01 situation|_|01 for all those involved|_|07 . someone|_|01 should step|_|10 in and put|_|07 a stop|_|05 to this . the united|_|05 states|_|02 or un|_|01 can do something . we should send|_|04 aid|_|01 .
i wish|_|02 there was something more that i could do . this is getting|_|01 out of hand|_|01 , but it 's kind|_|01 of far|_|03 away|_|01 geographically|_|01 from us|_|01 . there needs|_|02 to be something the international|_|03 community|_|01 can do . farmers|_|01 everywhere|_|01 are killing|_|01 pests|_|04 and animals|_|01 that interfere|_|01 with their farms|_|01 , but elephants|_|02 are completely|_|01 different|_|05 from pests|_|04 . they are extremely|_|01 smart|_|12 and are just hungry|_|01 . i honestly|_|02 wonder|_|01 if we should come|_|04 up with a plan|_|01 to feed|_|03 them , and this might|_|01 sound|_|01 crazy|_|03 , but try|_|01 to study|_|06 elephants|_|02 and come|_|04 up with some way|_|01 to communicate|_|05 abstract|_|03 ideas|_|01 with them .
so , about climate|_|02 change|_|01 , i just read|_|03 an article|_|04 about it . i have never|_|02 really|_|01 been concerned|_|02 about climate|_|02 change|_|01 , i think|_|13 it 's a huge|_|01 act|_|04 that is exaggerated|_|01 by the government|_|02 , media|_|02 , and everyone in between . the facts|_|03 about fire|_|09 increasing|_|02 are a little|_|05 scary|_|01 though|_|01 ... but i still|_|01 think|_|13 climate|_|02 change|_|01 is irrelevant|_|01 . maybe|_|01 fires|_|01 just happen|_|04 more
non|_|01 - human|_|03 animals|_|01 are given|_|27 rights|_|07 only because of their interactions|_|02 with human|_|03 beings . without involvement|_|02 with humans|_|02 , animals|_|01 do not deserve|_|01 rights|_|07 . it is through this interaction|_|02 with humans|_|02 that animals|_|01 are even|_|01 given|_|27 moral|_|01 consideration|_|04 . as the outcome|_|03 , animals|_|01 are becoming|_|04 even|_|01 further|_|03 tarred|_|01 in society|_|04 . humans|_|02 have and are continuing|_|02 to handle|_|01 animals|_|01 as if they are some kind|_|01 of material|_|05 goods|_|03 . this is considered|_|01 as being immoral|_|04 , as animals|_|01 have their own lives|_|02 , and they think|_|01 , have feelings|_|01 , can feel|_|05 pain|_|02 , require|_|04 love|_|02 , happiness|_|02 , and everything else|_|03 that humans|_|02 have . as for human|_|03 rights|_|07 , it ’s always|_|01 uncertain|_|04 .
the elections|_|04 nowadays|_|01 are just so unrelenting|_|01 . you have to spend|_|02 a lot|_|05 of money|_|01 on campaigns|_|01 and trying|_|01 to put|_|01 down the other person|_|01 . it 's a wonder|_|02 that man|_|10 does n't spend|_|02 all his|_|01 money|_|01 that he has earned|_|08 . i do n't think|_|02 he even|_|01 got|_|02 a chance|_|01 to tell|_|01 anyone what kind|_|01 of person|_|01 he is . he gets|_|02 torn|_|02 down before he has a chance|_|01 to do anything . i 'm just so mad|_|01 at the whole|_|01 election|_|04 system|_|08 and the way|_|11 things|_|08 are done . everything about your past|_|03 and present|_|01 gets|_|02 brought|_|11 up and nothing|_|01 you do can go|_|03 unnoticed|_|01 .
i feel|_|05 like|_|02 there is so many|_|01 people|_|01 out there that are less|_|02 fortunate|_|03 then us|_|01 , we need|_|01 to take|_|01 a second|_|01 to see|_|01 how people|_|01 feel|_|05 about themselves and the situations|_|02 they are in and the people|_|01 around|_|04 them . i feel|_|05 like|_|02 the person|_|01 writing|_|10 this has gone|_|03 through a lot|_|05 in his|_|01 life|_|13 and this all just adds|_|02 into the fact|_|04 of everything else|_|03
i ca|_|01 n't believe|_|01 what i just read|_|06 . i read|_|06 this article|_|02 about how riot|_|01 police|_|01 took|_|06 down some pipeline|_|02 protesters|_|01 in north|_|02 dakota|_|02 . the armed|_|01 police|_|01 used|_|01 such violent|_|02 and aggressive|_|03 tactics|_|01 to take|_|06 down the protesters|_|01 . the protesters|_|01 were native|_|01 americans|_|03 and environmental|_|02 activists|_|01 . being environmental|_|02 activist|_|01 ourselves could you imagine|_|02 how we would react|_|01 to being treated|_|01 this way|_|11 . they used|_|01 sonic|_|01 devices|_|03 and rubber|_|01 bullets|_|01 shooting|_|18 the protesters|_|01 in the face|_|02 . i 'm outraged|_|01 by these actions|_|01 . this is totally|_|01 uncalled for and violates|_|01 several|_|01 codes|_|02 of conduct|_|01 . the cause|_|02 of the protest|_|03 was that the pipeline|_|02 was affecting|_|01 the local|_|03 's water|_|02 supply|_|01 . i do n't blame|_|02 them for protesting|_|02 one|_|04 bit|_|02 . the actions|_|01 and the engagement|_|03 by the riot|_|01 police|_|01 of north|_|02 dakota|_|02 was shameful|_|12 and they should be punished|_|01 .
hello|_|01 friend|_|01 , how have you been lately|_|01 , i am somewhat|_|01 depressed|_|01 by an article|_|04 that i read|_|03 recently|_|01 , that helped|_|01 me a lot|_|05 , that i realized|_|08 that the article|_|04 had a problem|_|01 that interested|_|01 me more , because of the events|_|01 that were happening|_|02 in this , for example|_|04 : he did not vaccinate|_|02 or treat|_|08 his|_|01 cattle|_|01 due|_|02 to illness|_|01 ; he does not use|_|04 cowboys|_|01 to control|_|06 them and cope|_|01 ; does not manage|_|02 or control|_|06 the reproduction|_|05
this is so sad|_|02 . today|_|02 i read|_|06 about a lady|_|03 who passed|_|01 away|_|02 november|_|01 6ht and had shared|_|02 many|_|01 of her stories|_|02 of her experiences|_|03 in the holocaust|_|02 . it 's very sad|_|02 to think|_|03 there are n't many|_|01 people|_|01 left|_|01 to share|_|02 these stories|_|02 . i remember|_|07 being in junior|_|03 high|_|01 and hearing|_|02 someone|_|01 speak|_|02 about it , and to think|_|03 kids|_|01 these days|_|02 will never|_|01 get|_|02 that . thankfully|_|02 , there are museums|_|01 for people|_|01 to attend|_|10 to hear|_|02 and get|_|02 closer|_|01 to what truly|_|01 happened|_|02 back|_|01 then .
" a bus|_|01 driver|_|05 , going|_|01 about doing his|_|01 business|_|01 , supporting|_|01 the community|_|01 , has had his|_|01 life|_|01 taken|_|02 from him in what is a senseless|_|01 and needless|_|01 act|_|04 .

" " all the people|_|01 were at the back|_|05 trying|_|08 to get|_|04 out of the bus|_|01 but they could n't get|_|04 out the front|_|04 because of the flames|_|03 , " " he told|_|01 the courier|_|01 - mail|_|02 newspaper|_|04 .

dear|_|04 friend|_|01 , i have just read|_|03 a horrific|_|01 story|_|03 coming|_|01 out of hon kong . this man|_|01 , a wealthy|_|01 hon kong banker|_|02 , murdered|_|01 two|_|01 young|_|01 women|_|02 in his|_|01 apartment|_|01 in a gruesome|_|01 and sadistic|_|01 fashion|_|03 . he tortured|_|02 them repeatedly|_|01 inside|_|01 of his|_|01 luxurious|_|03 downtown|_|01 apartment|_|01 near|_|02 hon kong 's red|_|01 light|_|02 district|_|01 . he planned|_|03 to torture|_|02 them with tools|_|01 and sex|_|02 toys|_|03 but had to cut|_|01 it short|_|06 when one|_|05 of the women|_|02 started|_|07 screaming|_|02 loudly|_|01 in his|_|01 apartment|_|01 . he slit|_|02 her throat|_|04 and stuffed|_|02 her body|_|08 into a suitcase|_|06 .
i feel|_|13 pretty|_|01 indifferent|_|07 about this kind|_|01 of thing|_|11 overall|_|02 . it ’s not fair|_|07 to the men|_|01 , but at the same time|_|06 society|_|02 has been conditioned|_|01 in such a way|_|04 that we have a higher|_|07 demand|_|01 for female|_|03 models|_|03 and lower|_|02 demand|_|01 for male|_|03 models|_|03 . society|_|02 is unfair|_|01 in a lot|_|04 of ways|_|04 , and this is one|_|05 of the few ways|_|04 where women|_|02 benefit|_|01 over men|_|01 .
i was reading|_|05 an article|_|03 about the erika virus|_|03 . it was a fairly|_|01 comprehensive|_|02 article|_|03 that went|_|03 over what the virus|_|03 was and how it affects|_|01 humans|_|02 . it 's scary|_|01 how it can be transmitted|_|04 through sexual|_|02 intercourse|_|01 . i still|_|04 do n't think|_|09 i have any serious|_|06 chance|_|01 of contracting|_|04 the virus|_|03 fortunately|_|01 . those that have are going|_|03 to have a hard|_|01 time|_|04 in life|_|01 .
environmentalism|_|02 at its core|_|08 is a racket|_|04 . the leaders|_|01 will use|_|01 whatever|_|01 methods|_|01 to tie|_|08 nature|_|04 together|_|03 to guilt|_|02 you into accepting|_|20 higher|_|01 and higher|_|01 taxes|_|01 towards cost|_|01 of living|_|07 while majority|_|03 of this money|_|03 goes|_|01 towards these non|_|01 - profit|_|02 organizations|_|01 that help|_|01 them push|_|09 their agenda|_|02 . these environmental|_|02 groups|_|01 are only capable|_|02 of gutting|_|02 their own people|_|01 and will not address|_|05 the larger|_|01 oil|_|01 buyers|_|01 such as china|_|01 or any other third|_|01 world|_|08 nation|_|04 that is burning|_|01 coal|_|01 . by raising|_|02 the cost|_|01 of oil|_|01 is n't going|_|01 to stop|_|01 saudi|_|01 arabia|_|01 or russia|_|01 from pumping|_|04 oil|_|01 , its all a racket|_|04 to control|_|05 the power|_|01 supply|_|01 and tax|_|01 the people|_|01 .
the human|_|03 rights|_|07 groups|_|01 are right|_|12 . it is brutal|_|02 . i 'm glad|_|03 we do n't punish|_|01 people|_|01 like|_|02 that in our country|_|01 , but i also|_|02 feel|_|05 like|_|02 this guy|_|03 in question|_|02 deserves|_|01 it . the problem|_|02 is that punishments|_|01 like|_|02 that end|_|01 up being applied|_|01 to people|_|01 who do n't deserve|_|01 it too . in this particular|_|02 case|_|08 , i do n't feel|_|05 bad|_|01 for the guy|_|03 at all . he 's a monster|_|01 .
if people|_|01 had to see|_|05 how their food|_|01 was killed|_|15 , there 's a good|_|13 chance|_|02 they would n't want|_|05 to eat|_|06 it . between a live|_|09 chicken|_|01 and the package|_|01 you buy|_|05 at the grocery|_|01 store|_|01 lies|_|05 a world|_|08 of torture|_|05 . the inhumane|_|01 way|_|11 some of our food|_|01 , particularly|_|01 chicken|_|01 , makes|_|43 it 's way|_|11 to our dinner|_|02 plate|_|04 is beyond|_|03 disturbing|_|11 . factory|_|01 farming|_|01 is simply|_|02 another|_|01 word|_|07 for animal|_|01 torture|_|05 .
i think|_|03 murmansk|_|01 opinions|_|01 on the oil|_|01 import|_|01 has some actual|_|03 valid|_|02 points|_|23 . i feel|_|05 like|_|02 his|_|01 plans|_|01 and what he wants|_|01 to do is a good|_|13 idea|_|01 . i also|_|02 feel|_|05 like|_|02 their are too many|_|01 people|_|03 just trying|_|01 to make|_|08 a quick|_|01 few bucks|_|01 , they 'll do anything and everything to get|_|02 there way|_|02 . i feel|_|05 bad|_|01 for some of the less|_|03 fortunate|_|03 consumers|_|01 who have to be tricked|_|01 into paying|_|09 these ridiculous|_|02 high|_|05 prices|_|04 for oil|_|01 .
its so obvious|_|01 how much|_|01 lady|_|03 periods|_|01 and pills|_|04 we have to take|_|29 are linked|_|02 to our depression|_|01 and body|_|01 pains|_|04 . the chemistry|_|03 going|_|01 on in our body|_|01 is something i ca|_|01 nt|_|01 even|_|01 get|_|02 hold|_|01 of . the pill|_|04 though|_|01 is such a thing|_|01 we need|_|02 if we font|_|01 want|_|05 to have babies|_|03 that this time|_|02 . the after math|_|01 of it is just a deeper|_|04 conversation|_|01 we have to understand|_|02 so that we font|_|01 end|_|02 of hurting|_|06 yourself .
i can not believe|_|01 the struggle|_|03 that has to be . and for god|_|03 sake|_|03 , all of them are mostly|_|01 arson|_|01 , well|_|07 into the 70|_|01 % range|_|06 . i ca|_|01 n't believe|_|01 that at all . seems|_|04 a bit|_|02 high|_|01 but i guess|_|02 people|_|01 just have no respect|_|03 for nature|_|02 or other peoples|_|01 lives|_|11 . having your house|_|01 burn|_|01 down in a wild|_|01 fire|_|09 has to be one|_|01 of the worst|_|09 things|_|01 that could happen|_|01 to someone|_|01 . all your belongings|_|01 , all those memories|_|05 , the life|_|11 you built|_|01 and the family|_|04 or friends|_|03 you surrounded|_|01 yourself with . gone|_|04 . well|_|05 hopefully|_|01 not your family|_|04 gone|_|03 cause|_|01 then you 'd really|_|01 be in trouble|_|03 but your house|_|01 at least|_|01 and sentimental|_|01 things|_|01 . i hope|_|02 that never|_|02 happens|_|01 to you .
this seems|_|02 like|_|04 a conspiracy|_|03 reach|_|01 , but the medical|_|02 exams|_|02 were either|_|01 lying|_|02 or the bodies|_|01 were really|_|01 never|_|02 examined|_|02 . the poles|_|10 have a reason|_|02 to distrust|_|01 russia- russia|_|01 does itself no favors|_|01 , no country|_|04 in the world|_|08 should trust|_|01 them- , they have a long|_|01 history|_|05 of conflict|_|01 . the reason|_|02 we had polish|_|01 jokes|_|01 in america|_|01 a few decades|_|01 ago|_|01 started|_|02 with russian|_|01 racism|_|02 towards poles|_|10 .
i think|_|03 this is a bizarre|_|01 article|_|04 . i am not sure|_|07 if there are air|_|08 pollution|_|01 problems|_|01 in sweden|_|01 . this seems|_|02 to be like|_|02 an incomplete|_|02 study|_|04 . i would be okay|_|01 if they took|_|04 the angle|_|01 that more densely|_|02 populated|_|02 areas|_|02 are likely|_|01 to trigger|_|04 mental|_|05 health|_|02 issues|_|02 because that has somewhat|_|01 been proven|_|08 in studies|_|04 in mice|_|04 . using|_|07 air|_|08 pollution|_|01 as a reason|_|06 for mental|_|05 health|_|02 issues|_|02 is weird|_|02 .
whenever you hear|_|04 about tragedy|_|02 you ca|_|01 n't help|_|01 but put|_|07 yourself in their place|_|01 and worry|_|04 about how they feel|_|05 . you wonder|_|03 about how they react|_|01 , and how they can believe|_|01 that a simple|_|02 accident|_|02 can hurt|_|06 someone|_|01 that they love|_|02 . i am sure|_|02 that they will second|_|01 guess|_|02 themselves , and wonder|_|03 how they could let|_|01 something like|_|02 that happen|_|03 .
how are you drake|_|02 i hope|_|03 you are enjoying|_|04 your new|_|10 life|_|03 and your stay|_|05 in new|_|10 york|_|01 , i hope|_|03 you enjoy|_|04 this new|_|10 stage|_|03 of your life|_|03 now that you are working|_|03 as a journalist|_|01 i hope|_|03 to see|_|01 you soon|_|01 in a big|_|01 television|_|01 network|_|01 or read|_|06 your articles|_|04 in the biggest|_|01 national|_|04 newspapers|_|01 i hope|_|03 it 's good|_|02 for you , my friend|_|02 , see|_|01 you later|_|01 and take|_|06 good|_|02 care|_|06 of yourself
it funny|_|01 how people|_|01 do stupid|_|01 things|_|09 that just pop|_|11 into their mind|_|01 like|_|02 taking|_|04 a topless|_|01 selfish|_|01 while driving|_|06 just to send|_|02 it to the other person|_|01 . seriously|_|01 if u|_|01 want|_|01 to do that just park|_|01 the car|_|01 at the site|_|01 and do it , it not ur|_|01 live|_|01 that u|_|01 are putting|_|01 in danger|_|02 , it also|_|02 other pol|_|02 live|_|01 that can easily|_|03 ruined|_|02 if u|_|01 font|_|01 drive|_|08 carefully|_|01
i just read|_|06 an article|_|04 about america|_|01 's refugee|_|01 problem|_|01 , that talked|_|03 about the somali|_|02 community|_|01 in minneapolis|_|01 . i ca|_|01 n't believe|_|01 the emotional|_|06 language|_|01 they tried|_|01 to use|_|01 in the article|_|04 ; it just makes|_|43 me sick|_|01 to see|_|05 any reporting|_|03 that does n't only concern|_|04 the facts|_|04 , with no editorializing|_|01 by the author|_|01 . i wish|_|02 that everyone who decided|_|01 to become|_|04 a writer|_|01 would learn|_|02 that there is no place|_|12 for opinion|_|01 in the news|_|01 .
dude|_|01 , there is some pretty|_|01 messed|_|02 up stuff|_|04 going|_|01 on . i feel|_|05 like|_|04 every|_|02 time|_|04 i turn|_|10 on the news|_|01 or open|_|09 a newspaper|_|01 i am reading|_|03 about pedophilia|_|01 going|_|01 on all over the world|_|03 . i feel|_|05 like|_|04 it is much|_|04 more common|_|09 than anyone realizes|_|03 and that at any given|_|01 moment|_|05 , i could be walking|_|10 past|_|01 someone|_|01 who is sexually|_|02 attracted|_|03 to children|_|03 . it is crazy|_|03 to think|_|13 about and really|_|01 scary|_|01 .
i 'm no parent|_|01 and i completely|_|01 believe|_|01 donald trump|_|02 is a horrible|_|03 man|_|08 . with that being said|_|01 , i do n't think|_|01 it is correct|_|02 to shun|_|01 your child|_|02 from having a different|_|03 belief|_|01 as you . children|_|02 should be able|_|02 to freely|_|01 be able|_|02 to open|_|04 up a discussion|_|02 with their parents|_|01 and analyze|_|01 their opposing|_|02 views|_|03 without worrying|_|06 if they will receive|_|13 any type|_|05 of punishment|_|01 . i love|_|01 jokes|_|01 and pulling|_|16 pranks|_|01 , but to do that to your own child|_|02 and then to publicly|_|02 embarrass|_|01 them ... well|_|13 that does n't seem|_|04 funny|_|02 at all to me . it worries|_|06 me that the child|_|02 will from now on tiptoe|_|01 around|_|01 certain|_|02 topics|_|01 for fear|_|03 of upsetting|_|02 their parent|_|01 .

its sad|_|01 and all but when is there every|_|02 not trouble|_|04 in the middle|_|04 east|_|03 ? you know|_|05 my grandmother|_|01 was syrian|_|01 so this maybe|_|01 should be more personal|_|04 for me , but its kind|_|01 of not . those people|_|01 are crazy|_|05 . fell|_|01 sorry|_|01 for the civilians|_|01 though|_|01 and the united|_|01 states|_|04 should really|_|01 take|_|01 a lot|_|05 of refugees|_|01 from there .
funny|_|01 how it always|_|04 comes|_|01 down the to the gun|_|02 and not the person|_|01 wielding|_|02 it . people|_|01 will always|_|04 be able|_|04 to get|_|02 guns|_|02 , legally|_|02 or not . the issue|_|01 is more with society|_|02 treatment|_|03 of young|_|01 men|_|01 . too many|_|01 single|_|01 moms|_|01 , too many|_|01 kids|_|02 being ostracized|_|02 and bullied|_|02 . but yeah|_|01 , that 's the gun|_|02 's fault|_|07 . i do n't own a gun|_|02 , but i 'd be damned|_|03 if i gave|_|43 one|_|02 up to those liberal|_|12 fascists|_|01 .
i just read|_|06 this article|_|02 about a forest|_|01 land|_|04 in indonesia|_|01 that could potentially|_|01 be cut|_|01 down and turned|_|10 in to a tree|_|01 plant|_|01 . normally|_|01 an article|_|02 like|_|02 this might|_|01 not attract|_|03 my attention|_|01 and cause|_|02 me to read|_|06 any further , but this particular|_|02 forest|_|01 land|_|04 is home|_|02 to the 3rd|_|01 largest|_|06 population|_|05 of endangered|_|02 orangutans|_|01 and if the forest|_|01 is cut|_|01 down , it is estimated|_|01 that 1750 orangutans|_|01 will die|_|11 or have to be rescued|_|02 and re - homed|_|02 . this is so heartbreaking|_|02 to me because these are innocent|_|07 animals|_|01 , endangered|_|02 ones|_|02 at that , that are just living|_|07 in their natural|_|04 environment|_|01 and have done nothing|_|01 wrong|_|05 . how can the government|_|02 in indonesia|_|01 think|_|06 that this idea|_|01 is even|_|01 a possibility|_|02 , never|_|02 mind|_|01 the fact|_|01 it could not possibly|_|01 be a positive|_|01 thing|_|09 because of the negative|_|05 impact|_|02 it has on this species|_|01 ! !
those native|_|03 people|_|01 really|_|01 font|_|01 deserve|_|01 that kind|_|01 of treatment|_|03 its unfair|_|01 . how can you have people|_|01 just not speak|_|03 their own native|_|03 language|_|01 ? i font|_|01 get|_|02 why they ca|_|01 nt|_|01 just let|_|02 them live|_|01 in both worlds|_|03 and experience|_|05 both cultures|_|02 instead|_|01 of forcing|_|02 them to be a part|_|03 of their specific|_|02 culture|_|02 . they really|_|01 need|_|02 to be spoken|_|03 up against for this kind|_|01 of injustice|_|02
hello|_|01 again ! writing|_|10 to share|_|01 some things|_|10 i have been learning|_|04 about . i read|_|06 that syrians|_|01 and iraqis|_|01 are granted|_|07 asylum|_|03 in germany|_|01 far|_|03 more often|_|03 than pakistanis|_|01 , and nigerians|_|01 . germany|_|01 is confronting|_|04 the task|_|01 of deciding|_|04 who gets|_|02 to stay|_|02 . if you ’re from syria|_|01 or iraq|_|01 , sanctuary|_|03 is almost|_|07 guaranteed|_|03 . but if you ’re from nigeria|_|01 or pakistan|_|01 , chances|_|02 are you journeyed|_|04 all the way|_|12 there for nothing|_|01 . this is so distressing|_|01 !
why would anyone , let|_|01 alone|_|02 a group|_|01 of 10|_|01 - 15|_|01 teenagers|_|01 feel|_|05 the need|_|01 to attack|_|01 an innocent|_|05 person|_|01 ? chase|_|01 them down and hurt|_|06 them and than steal|_|01 their wallet|_|01 ? what in the world|_|08 are these parents|_|01 doing ? my mother|_|01 would have killed|_|02 me herself if she ever|_|03 found|_|05 out i was treating|_|01 anyone that way|_|01 . as far|_|05 as any by standers|_|01 that were possible|_|01 in the area|_|01 , i truly|_|01 hope|_|03 that they came|_|04 forward|_|01 and these individuals|_|01 were arrested|_|01 and detained|_|01 . they are obviously|_|01 a dangerous|_|01 group|_|01 of kids|_|01 , who know|_|10 right|_|01 from wrong|_|05 , but for some reason|_|06 , they do n't think|_|02 the law|_|01 applies|_|01 to them .
so theirs this push|_|05 to remove|_|01 your money|_|03 from banks|_|02 involved|_|07 in the pipeline|_|02 screwing|_|03 over the sou|_|01 ix|_|01 . in thinking|_|11 about it . kick|_|07 the banks|_|02 that are kicking|_|07 the native|_|03 americans|_|03 seems|_|02 like|_|02 a good|_|01 way|_|01 to make|_|35 a point|_|23 . all the understand|_|03 is the bottom|_|02 line|_|02 , and the pipeline|_|02 company|_|01 will lose|_|07 their backers|_|03 if they begin|_|10 to lose|_|07 too much|_|01 money|_|03
i 'm really|_|01 confused|_|01 at why multiple|_|01 articles|_|02 were mushed|_|01 together|_|03 like|_|02 this . at first|_|02 i was perturbed|_|03 at the first|_|02 article|_|02 because i felt|_|01 like|_|02 the lady|_|03 was being ridiculous|_|03 . she weighs|_|03 500|_|01 pounds|_|03 , so obviously|_|01 a 1200 calorie|_|01 diet|_|04 is going|_|03 to cause|_|02 her to lose|_|01 weight|_|02 , the fact|_|03 that she ca|_|01 n't find|_|05 a scale|_|07 to weigh|_|03 her does n't matter|_|02 . you do n't need|_|02 a scale|_|07 to tell|_|01 you 're losing|_|01 weight|_|02 . measure|_|02 your body|_|01 with measuring|_|01 tape|_|04 . but then i got|_|01 to the article|_|02 about the mexican|_|01 students|_|01 and found|_|05 it really|_|01 horrifying|_|02 . i ca|_|01 n't believe|_|01 the terrible|_|02 things|_|08 people|_|01 do to one|_|01 another|_|01 :(
again it 's all about the money|_|03 . corporate|_|04 america|_|01 strikes|_|21 again . they leech|_|02 as much|_|01 money|_|03 from the working|_|02 class|_|01 as possible|_|01 as they sit|_|02 in their office|_|01 , finger|_|03 banging|_|01 their secretary|_|02 . when their lies|_|02 and misdirection|_|01 is revealed|_|02 , some fat|_|01 cat|_|01 takes|_|16 the blame|_|02 ( along|_|03 with millions|_|02 of dollars|_|02 of hush|_|01 money|_|03 , and the working|_|02 class|_|01 is thrown|_|12 to the wolves|_|01 and blamed|_|03 for most of the misdeeds|_|01 .
i am not over there , so i do n't fully|_|01 know|_|05 what 's going|_|03 on . i do know|_|05 that we should be helping|_|01 these poor|_|01 people|_|01 out of the water|_|02 and not letting|_|01 them die|_|01 from exhaustion|_|03 or whatever|_|01 else|_|03 is causing|_|02 their death|_|01 , especially|_|01 not 2|_|01 month|_|02 old|_|01 babies|_|02 . this is just appalling|_|02 that countries|_|04 can not come|_|05 to aid|_|02 these people|_|01 . yes|_|01 , they know|_|05 the risk|_|04 involved|_|02 , but because of other countries|_|04 bombing|_|07 their land|_|04 out they are trying|_|01 to find|_|01 a better|_|13 and safer|_|02 situation|_|02 for themselves and for their families|_|01 . i do n't blame|_|02 them trying|_|01 to better|_|01 themselves from the war|_|04 - torn|_|02 countries|_|04 that they come|_|05 from . i have sympathy|_|03 for all of these people|_|01 .
it is so unfortunate|_|03 that people|_|01 are being attacked|_|01 because of their religion|_|01 . a lot|_|05 of christians|_|01 in mosul|_|01 were ordered|_|02 to convert|_|09 away|_|10 from their beliefs|_|01 or suffer|_|01 heavy|_|23 consequences|_|03 . this is not a choice|_|02 most people|_|01 want|_|01 to make|_|43 , let|_|01 alone|_|02 be forced|_|01 to flee|_|01 their homes|_|01 . churches|_|01 , homes|_|01 , and streets|_|05 were not safe|_|02 . many|_|01 people|_|01 have considered|_|01 fleeing|_|01 over returning|_|07 . however|_|01 , the human|_|03 spirit|_|02 is strong|_|01 . we all face|_|02 adversity|_|01 . some are brave|_|01 enough|_|01 to face|_|02 the terror|_|04 and harassment|_|02 they experienced|_|01 to rebuild|_|01 their lives|_|02 .
this article|_|04 highlights|_|02 the fact|_|03 that although we may|_|01 have profound|_|03 faith|_|01 in the goodness|_|03 of human|_|01 nature|_|04 , we never|_|02 know|_|01 when a killer|_|01 is walking|_|01 among us|_|01 . the recent|_|01 spate|_|02 of mass|_|03 shootings|_|02 at schools|_|02 and other locations|_|04 underline|_|02 the presence|_|02 of disturbed|_|01 people|_|01 in our midst|_|01 . besides|_|02 defending|_|08 ourselves , we need|_|02 to ask|_|01 ourselves what in our society|_|02 is provoking|_|02 this disturbing|_|11 behavior|_|01 . certainly|_|01 the ubiquity|_|01 and ease|_|04 of acquiring|_|03 guns|_|01 is one|_|01 cause|_|01 , but there may|_|01 be others that need|_|02 attention|_|03 as well|_|03 .
i hate|_|01 it when these terrorist|_|01 attacks|_|09 happen|_|01 on innocent|_|03 people|_|03 who are just living|_|02 their lives|_|02 . i do n't know|_|05 how open|_|05 societies|_|02 can completely|_|01 eliminate|_|03 them ? you ca|_|01 n't put|_|02 the terrorist|_|01 stigma|_|04 on everyone of a certain|_|06 religion|_|02 and you ca|_|01 n't close|_|04 off your society|_|02 . there 's always|_|04 going|_|03 to be religious|_|01 zealots|_|01 and crazy|_|03 people|_|03 who feel|_|07 violence|_|03 is the only way|_|05 to get|_|03 their ideas|_|03 across|_|02 , but we just have to keep|_|02 fighting|_|06 them and trying|_|01 our best|_|03 to prevent|_|02 an attack|_|09 when possible|_|01 .
well|_|02 , there was another|_|01 shooting|_|02 . this one|_|05 was in washington|_|05 . there is no real|_|04 motive|_|01 at this time|_|02 , but they do n't think|_|03 it was terrorism|_|01 . maybe|_|01 a broken|_|08 heart|_|03 ? anyways|_|01 , it 's getting|_|01 ridiculous|_|03 how many|_|01 people|_|01 are affected|_|02 with these mass|_|03 shootings|_|02 . just because someone|_|01 has a grudge|_|01 or a mental|_|01 problem|_|01 .
the wildfire|_|01 burned|_|15 the field|_|01 more than 13,300 acres|_|03 . this is the 75|_|01 % of agricultural|_|01 land|_|02 . the farmers|_|03 was very sad|_|02 about the wildfire|_|01 . their lands|_|02 are damaged|_|01 very highly|_|03 due|_|02 to the wildfire|_|01 . the emergency|_|01 fire|_|09 safety|_|06 team|_|02 save|_|03 the 25|_|01 % of land|_|02 from the wildfire|_|01 . this could be very helpful|_|01 to the farmers|_|03 . although , they loss|_|01 the 75|_|01 % agricultural|_|01 land|_|02 . even|_|04 they are did not plant|_|04 any plants|_|04 from the burned|_|15 agricultural|_|01 land|_|02 .
well|_|12 , i font|_|01 really|_|01 feel|_|05 much|_|01 about this either|_|01 way|_|11 . i feel|_|05 badly|_|02 for the family|_|04 of the victim|_|02 , i 'm sure|_|06 they are devastated|_|01 , but it 's not surprising|_|01 something like|_|02 this would happen|_|04 , given|_|01 the type|_|04 of things|_|05 he wrote|_|05 , and the climate|_|02 in the country|_|02 in which they lived|_|07 . my thoughts|_|01 of out to the family|_|04 .
i read|_|06 an article|_|04 about typhoon|_|01 meantime|_|01 . the article|_|04 said|_|01 the storm|_|01 passed|_|01 by taiwan|_|02 without actually|_|04 hitting|_|04 the island|_|01 , which i suppose|_|02 was a good|_|13 thing|_|09 , because evidently|_|01 there was another|_|01 storm|_|01 in 2009 , ty phone|_|02 moralist|_|01 , that killed|_|01 a bunch|_|02 of people|_|03 and did billions|_|02 of dollars|_|04 of damage|_|02 . i 'm glad|_|03 i do n't live|_|01 somewhere|_|01 where there 's any inclement|_|01 weather|_|01 like|_|02 that , it must|_|01 be miserable|_|01 to live|_|01 on an island|_|01 where it 's hot|_|20 and crowded|_|06 .
" i am sharing|_|02 this because i wish|_|02 people|_|01 can understand|_|01 what humans|_|02 are doing to the environment|_|02 and how its actually|_|02 affecting|_|02 our climate|_|02 . we are going|_|01 through climate|_|02 change|_|06 , and it seems|_|02 like|_|02 the world|_|08 does not care|_|02 because there 's still|_|01 pollution|_|01 and etc . the attic|_|01 glaciers|_|01 are melting|_|02 , waters|_|02 are getting|_|02 warmer|_|01 and people|_|01 say|_|01 that 's not " " global|_|01 warming|_|01 " " . definitely|_|01 give|_|14 this article|_|04 a read|_|01 if you are into environmental|_|02 stuff|_|04 . "
lockets|_|01 with blood|_|05 ? dang , that is kind|_|01 of creepy|_|02 and weird|_|02 guys|_|03 , but oh|_|01 well|_|03 , they were in love|_|02 . people|_|03 do crazy|_|05 things|_|01 when they are in love|_|02 . now , the fact|_|04 that this guy|_|03 never|_|02 felt|_|03 enough|_|02 indicates|_|02 auto|_|01 esteem|_|03 issues|_|01 , she is not god|_|03 , dude|_|06 . i still|_|01 can not believe|_|01 angelina is over , they were end|_|10 game|_|01 to me , but oh|_|01 well|_|03 , guess|_|02 you can not force|_|02 things|_|01 .
why are they prescribing|_|03 things|_|12 like|_|02 that to such young|_|01 kids|_|05 ? that 's so insane|_|01 . benzodiazepines|_|01 , especially|_|01 , should n't be prescribed|_|03 in general|_|02 , in my opinion|_|01 . doctors|_|01 are overly|_|01 calm|_|01 about the things|_|12 they prescribe|_|03 to people|_|03 , people|_|03 that young|_|01 should n't be subjected|_|01 to that , and the death|_|06 tolls|_|01 are n't surprising|_|01 .
this is horribly|_|01 to read|_|06 about . the sheer|_|02 number|_|07 of people|_|01 dying|_|02 every|_|02 day|_|01 , just trying|_|01 to escape|_|05 on boats|_|01 , is quite|_|04 alarming|_|02 . think|_|03 about people|_|01 from one|_|05 country|_|01 equaling|_|01 those people|_|01 dying|_|02 in gang|_|01 violence|_|01 in major|_|04 , crime|_|01 ridden|_|02 societies|_|02 - but just for people|_|01 attempting|_|01 to escape|_|05 via water|_|06 . what should we do about this ? open|_|04 our borders|_|03 ? is it enough|_|02 to simply|_|03 help|_|06 them get|_|14 out of where they are to some place|_|12 safer|_|01 ? obviously|_|01 this inst|_|02 exactly|_|01 their fault|_|05 , especially|_|01 the kids|_|01 . but what can we do ? will money|_|01 help|_|01 ? probably|_|01 not . open|_|10 borders|_|03 will . bring|_|11 them here and help|_|06 them find|_|10 a more peaceful|_|01 way|_|06 through thrive|_|02 own lives|_|02 .
some people|_|01 are just disturbed|_|11 . everyone is going|_|03 to point|_|02 to mental|_|05 illness|_|01 in something like|_|02 this , but i fear|_|01 that when things|_|11 like|_|02 this happens|_|03 , it gets|_|02 easier|_|03 and easier|_|03 just to point|_|02 at people|_|01 and call|_|09 them mentally|_|01 ill|_|05 . i fear|_|01 that eventually|_|01 we are going|_|03 to get|_|02 to the point|_|18 where you can classify|_|04 someone|_|01 as mentally|_|01 ill|_|05 by the crowd|_|01 . just finger|_|01 pointing|_|02 . i feel|_|05 for these victims|_|02 and the victims|_|02 of crimes|_|02 in the future|_|01 because we spend|_|01 too much|_|01 time|_|05 making|_|02 excuses|_|02 and pointing|_|02 fingers|_|01 rather|_|01 than dealing|_|03 with the problems|_|01 at hand|_|06 .
i did’t know|_|05 that coconuts|_|01 are becoming|_|03 in short|_|09 supply|_|02 . it was a very interesting|_|01 article|_|04 . i did’t realize|_|02 how many|_|01 things|_|12 are made|_|03 with coconut|_|01 or that they have some kind|_|01 of bank|_|05 type|_|01 of thing|_|12 to keep|_|04 the seeds|_|01 . i find|_|04 it so amazing|_|01 to learn|_|02 about things|_|12 i knew|_|05 nothing|_|01 about . i love|_|01 coconuts|_|01 and did buy|_|04 some coconut|_|01 oil|_|02 but have n’t used|_|01 it yet|_|01 . i heard|_|02 that the oil|_|02 was good|_|01 for your skin|_|06 and hair|_|01 , although i have n’t tried|_|01 it yet|_|01 . reading|_|03 the article|_|04 made|_|03 me think|_|01 about the show|_|06 “ naked|_|05 and afraid|_|02 ” since the players|_|01 are often|_|01 in the jungle|_|03 , trying|_|01 to survivor|_|03 and finding|_|04 coconuts|_|01 on the trees|_|03 . or on the tv|_|01 show|_|06 survivor|_|03 , where they often|_|01 eat|_|06 and drink|_|05 coconut|_|01 juice|_|04 . in honesty|_|02 , i do n’t know|_|05 if i have ever|_|03 eaten|_|06 a coconut|_|01 even|_|03 though|_|01 i thought|_|01 i did . i eat|_|06 mango|_|02 , kiwi|_|01 ’s and oh|_|01

i just read|_|03 an article|_|04 about how billy|_|01 bob|_|02 thornton|_|01 felt|_|01 about his|_|01 marriage|_|02 to angelia josie . he expressed|_|03 that he did not feel|_|11 good|_|01 enough|_|01 to be with her . this was kind|_|01 of surprising|_|01 . it made|_|03 me feel|_|11 emphatic|_|03 towards him . he stated|_|02 that he did not like|_|04 being around|_|01 rich|_|11 and important|_|01 people|_|01 . this made|_|03 me feel|_|11 like|_|04 he is repeatable|_|01 . i did find|_|02 it odd|_|01 that they both wore|_|09 vials|_|01 of blood|_|05 around|_|01 their necks|_|03 while they were together|_|05 . it was a little|_|01 gross|_|03 . he even|_|03 went|_|01 into detail|_|04 about how they cut|_|24 their fingers|_|03 together|_|05 to get|_|01 the blood|_|05 and then compared|_|02 it the lockets|_|01 you can buy|_|04 and put|_|02 pictures|_|01 of your grandmas|_|01 in . i also|_|02 did not realize|_|08 that he is 20|_|01 years|_|03 her junior|_|03 . i found|_|02 that to be a little|_|01 old|_|07 but i have seen|_|01 it work|_|01 . the article|_|04 also|_|02 briefly|_|01 touched|_|01 on her relationship|_|03 with brad|_|01 .
this is a crazy|_|05 story|_|01 with so many|_|01 facets|_|02 to it , om . i mean|_|03 on one|_|02 hand|_|07 , i do n't support|_|10 an eye|_|05 for an eye|_|05 . i do n't support|_|10 the death|_|05 penalty|_|03 and i do n't support|_|10 blinding|_|02 someone|_|01 . but on the other hand|_|07 , this is a country|_|01 where women|_|01 really|_|01 struggle|_|03 and the justice|_|02 system|_|05 is not well|_|09 developed|_|01 . also|_|02 , he blinded|_|02 a four|_|01 year|_|01 old|_|01 girl|_|05 . what the fuck|_|01 is wrong|_|07 with this guy|_|03 . so if this was in america|_|01 i would not support|_|10 it , but i do n't feel|_|13 right|_|07 condemning|_|01 the actions|_|01 of an entirely|_|01 different|_|03 country|_|01 for doing what they felt|_|03 needed|_|03 to be done .
i just read|_|06 an article|_|04 that the u.n. reports|_|03 that isis|_|01 has executed|_|01 over 200|_|01 people|_|01 near|_|03 the iraqi|_|01 city|_|03 of mosul|_|01 and is using|_|01 thousands|_|01 of people|_|01 as human|_|01 shields|_|02 . the iraqi|_|01 forces|_|01 are advancing|_|01 against them and as a result|_|02 , isis|_|01 carried|_|02 out mass|_|03 killings|_|02 , punishing|_|01 people|_|01 who had defied|_|01 its orders|_|14 . they are even|_|03 forcing|_|01 women|_|02 to wear|_|04 gloves|_|02 to completely|_|01 cover|_|05 themselves , and accusing|_|02 anyone who has even|_|03 a cell|_|02 phone|_|02 of being a spy|_|02 . it seems|_|04 they are growing|_|07 increasingly|_|01 desperate|_|04 and determined|_|01 to take|_|35 the lives|_|03 and freedom|_|01 of everyone in their path|_|05 without regard|_|01 to civility|_|02 or even|_|03 basic|_|02 humanity|_|08 . this scourge|_|01 must|_|01 be stopped|_|01 , it is so heartbreaking|_|02 to read|_|06 about these victims|_|02 !
life|_|10 is a dangerous|_|02 thing|_|01 . people|_|01 are suffering|_|10 from natural|_|04 and man|_|08 - made|_|08 disasters|_|02 . there is a huge|_|01 number|_|07 of deaths|_|05 due|_|02 to hazing|_|02 in indonesia|_|01 . all driven|_|02 by over - industrialization|_|01 and hunger|_|01 of profits|_|02 . governments|_|03 and scientists|_|01 should do more to prevent|_|02 these kinds|_|01 of deaths|_|05 : at least|_|01 to have certain|_|01 warning|_|03 systems|_|08 installed|_|03 . also|_|02 , natural|_|04 disasters|_|02 such as hails|_|03 and typhoons|_|01 can wreck|_|01 a havoc|_|01 in peoples|_|01 ’ lives|_|10 . now i have second|_|01 thoughts|_|01 about traveling|_|01 to south|_|05 pacific|_|01 islands|_|01 . they are gorgeous|_|01 but dangerous|_|02 .
" i think|_|01 the short|_|09 of it really|_|01 is that the racists|_|01 won|_|01 the election|_|02 . it is incredibly|_|01 sad|_|02 that such a seemingly|_|01 easy|_|03 to win|_|01 election|_|02 against someone|_|01 who is openly|_|01 calling|_|03 groups|_|01 of racist|_|02 things|_|09 , and actually|_|02 encouraging|_|03 hate|_|01 and chaos|_|04 , was lost|_|11 . the democrats|_|01 are right|_|02 to be taking|_|02 a long|_|01 look|_|03 at how they do things|_|09 , they 've always|_|04 been the party|_|05 that is " " we 're like|_|02 the republicans|_|01 , but you wo n't gag|_|03 as much|_|01 voting|_|01 for us|_|01 . " " i think|_|01 the average|_|01 person|_|01 who cares|_|02 about politics|_|05 , and is liberal|_|02 , got|_|02 a shocking|_|01 wake|_|01 up call|_|03 this time|_|02 around|_|04 , and we 're going|_|04 to see|_|05 people|_|01 turn|_|01 out in incredible|_|01 numbers|_|04 to vote|_|01 . "
this is so sad|_|02 , but i think|_|03 it had a lot|_|05 to do with a bunch|_|01 of college|_|03 kids|_|02 drinking|_|01 and partying|_|03 , and then something going|_|04 terribly|_|01 wrong|_|01 . i think|_|03 there was a group|_|03 of kids|_|02 that started|_|08 arguing|_|02 with the guy|_|03 and one|_|01 got|_|01 pretty|_|01 riled|_|01 up and hit|_|01 the guy|_|03 . i find|_|02 it interesting|_|01 that there were things|_|01 that were not being commented|_|02 on . i think|_|03 there 's a lot|_|05 more to this story|_|03 than what the school|_|07 is reporting|_|04 .
i could not help|_|01 but think|_|01 of my and my son|_|02 would we be in a similar|_|03 situation|_|03 . i know|_|05 my son|_|02 is much|_|01 younger|_|03 and the situation|_|03 would be very different|_|01 , but part|_|01 of me can feel|_|05 the water|_|03 as we are swimming|_|01 to get|_|19 safe|_|03 . i can see|_|05 myself looking|_|02 back|_|04 to be sure|_|02 that he is still|_|04 with me , maybe|_|01 reaching|_|02 back|_|04 to try|_|01 to pull|_|01 him closer|_|01 . it is a very intense|_|03 thought|_|01 .
this is such a sad|_|02 story|_|03 . i feel|_|05 so much|_|01 for the mother|_|01 trying|_|01 to get|_|02 away|_|02 . sometimes|_|01 it seems|_|02 like|_|02 things|_|11 wo n't be so bad|_|09 . sometimes|_|01 it seems|_|02 like|_|02 tomorrow|_|02 is another|_|01 chance|_|02 , but it seems|_|02 to me that you ca|_|01 n't give|_|01 people|_|03 the opportunity|_|01 to destroy|_|02 because they will . i would always|_|04 encourage|_|03 a one|_|05 strike|_|02 policy|_|03 for my friends|_|01 . that reminds|_|01 me , how was your friend|_|01 after her husband|_|01 threatened|_|02 to shoot|_|01 her - are they still|_|01 together|_|02 ?
" i do n't understand|_|02 how people|_|03 can look|_|02 at stories|_|02 like|_|02 this and still|_|04 claim|_|05 that " " guns|_|07 do n't kill|_|01 people|_|03 , people|_|03 kill|_|01 people|_|03 " " . if guns|_|07 were less|_|02 available|_|03 and less|_|02 prevalent|_|01 in communities|_|01 prone|_|02 to violence|_|03 , then confrontations|_|05 between people|_|03 would be far|_|05 less|_|02 likely|_|01 to be lethal|_|02 . it needs|_|01 to be more difficult|_|02 to obtain|_|02 a firearm|_|01 in this country|_|04 . "
did you see|_|01 where republicans|_|03 are trying|_|01 to stop|_|01 black|_|12 people|_|01 from voting|_|04 . it 's like|_|02 its 1800 's again in the u.s.|_|01 and the rich|_|11 are using|_|01 the southern|_|02 strategy|_|02 to stop|_|01 likely|_|01 democrats|_|02 from voting|_|01 , using|_|01 the divide|_|01 and conquer|_|01 strategy|_|02 of trying|_|01 to turn|_|01 the people|_|01 against each other instead|_|01 of who they should be against . rich|_|11 republicans|_|03 . this is fascism|_|01 , nazism|_|01 , and we are going|_|01 to lose|_|06 our democracy|_|01 if people|_|01 do n't wake|_|02 up and get|_|01 in the streets|_|05 and demand|_|02 these people|_|01 be stopped|_|01 . it 's literally|_|02 a coup|_|01 of our government|_|02 .
oh|_|01 , but global|_|01 warming|_|02 is n't real|_|03 , right|_|01 ? we have all kinds|_|01 of time|_|04 to fix|_|02 the problem|_|02 , right|_|01 ? it 's not humans|_|02 , it 's natural|_|04 variation|_|11 , right|_|01 ? holy|_|01 crap|_|01 are we ever|_|01 ostriches|_|01 as a species|_|01 - are we going|_|03 to dig|_|02 our heads|_|02 out of the sand|_|02 in time|_|04 ? change|_|01 has to happen|_|02 , and it has to happen|_|02 now , we ca|_|01 n't wait|_|04 for all the old|_|01 white|_|10 men|_|01 who run|_|03 things|_|08 to die|_|04
did you know|_|01 that climate|_|02 change|_|09 threatens|_|03 the world|_|08 ’s coffee|_|01 supply|_|01 ? ? a report|_|03 i read|_|02 about a report|_|03 says|_|01 thinking|_|01 of the many|_|01 ways|_|01 climate|_|02 change|_|09 threatens|_|03 coffee|_|01 and coffee|_|01 farmers|_|03 has alarmed|_|02 people|_|03 who are now imagining|_|02 what it would be like|_|02 getting|_|01 through the day|_|10 without their caffeine|_|01 fix|_|01 ! well|_|09 , it certainly|_|01 is concerning|_|02 to me ! the report|_|03 , released|_|03 this month|_|02 , was commissioned|_|03 by fair|_|02 trade|_|03 australia|_|02 and new|_|01 zeal|_|02 and supposedly|_|01 the hub|_|02 of the global|_|01 fair|_|02 trade|_|03 system|_|08 . i guess|_|02 it does’t contain|_|02 much|_|01 new|_|01 research|_|01 , but still|_|01 it has made|_|08 waves|_|09 by collating|_|02 an array|_|04 of available|_|01 literature|_|04 suggesting|_|01 that climate|_|02 change|_|09 will have a major|_|03 effect|_|02 on the world|_|08 ’s coffee|_|01 supply|_|01 . well|_|02 , knowing|_|01 how you love|_|01 your coffee|_|01 just as much|_|01 as i do , i just knew|_|01 this would fascinate|_|02 you ! tell|_|01 everyone ! !
i pretty|_|01 much|_|01 hate|_|01 all wildlife|_|01 including|_|01 squirrels|_|01 . they should just go|_|01 blast|_|09 the little|_|03 varmint|_|02 . after all squirrels|_|01 carry|_|02 rabies|_|01 and other diseases|_|01 even|_|04 if they say|_|02 small|_|03 animals|_|01 seldom|_|01 have rabies|_|01 . once you bite|_|02 a human|_|03 , it 's over and you deserve|_|01 to die|_|04 . it is kind|_|01 of funny|_|02 though|_|01 these elderly|_|01 people|_|01 not being able|_|03 to get|_|07 away|_|01 . why does everything wacky|_|01 always|_|04 happen|_|01 in florida|_|01 . like|_|02 30|_|01 % of anything strange|_|01 happens|_|01 in florida|_|01 . frankly|_|01 i think|_|03 some reporter|_|01 made|_|01 the whole|_|01 thing|_|05 up . squirrels|_|01 are not going|_|01 to attack|_|03 multiple|_|01 people|_|01 . sure|_|07 they might|_|01 on a rare|_|05 occasion|_|01 bite|_|02 someone|_|01 but not three|_|02 people|_|01 . then again it 's florida|_|01 so common|_|06 laws|_|03 and logic|_|02 go|_|01 out the window|_|05 . anyhow|_|01 thought|_|03 you might|_|01 enjoy|_|02 some rambling|_|01 on some things|_|05 i read|_|05 . take|_|02 care|_|01 buddy|_|01 . later|_|01 .
i just read|_|05 an article|_|04 about a mother|_|01 and father|_|01 that sexually|_|02 abused|_|03 their daughter|_|01 from the age|_|01 of 11|_|01 . it is just disgusting|_|02 . i ca|_|01 n't imagine|_|02 how in the world|_|08 someone|_|01 would be okay|_|01 doing this to their child|_|02 . those parents|_|01 deserve|_|01 a fate|_|04 worse|_|09 than death|_|06 . what is wrong|_|07 with people|_|01 ? they deserved|_|01 to be tortured|_|02 until the day|_|03 they die|_|02 . so disgusting|_|02 .
i think|_|02 we should just leave|_|02 them where they are . they 're not causing|_|01 any problems|_|01 . they 're too dangerous|_|02 and too costly|_|01 to try|_|01 to move|_|01 . there has n't been great|_|03 reports|_|02 of them starving|_|01 . they should be fine|_|06 to roam|_|12 around|_|01 there for now . we do n't want|_|01 to waste|_|08 tax|_|01 dollars|_|04 to try|_|01 to deal|_|03 with a dangerous|_|02 situation|_|03 .
i have very little|_|01 sympathy|_|03 for turkey|_|02 , it 's a country|_|04 that has been playing|_|05 every|_|01 sides|_|10 of the field|_|01 it can for a long|_|02 time|_|03 . it is so split|_|02 , because of this . i feel|_|04 for the people|_|01 , and that 's why there are so many|_|01 split|_|01 groups|_|03 , not counting|_|08 outside|_|01 terrorist|_|01 groups|_|03 trying|_|01 to gain|_|01 influence|_|05 in the area|_|01 . i feel|_|04 nothing|_|01 for the country|_|04 , only the people|_|01 .
i was reading|_|09 an article|_|02 about poachers|_|03 killing|_|02 off many|_|01 elephants|_|02 because of the ivory|_|01 trade|_|03 . one|_|06 part|_|09 that stuck|_|15 in my mind|_|01 is that in one|_|06 country|_|04 , the elephants|_|02 are protected|_|02 more than they are in the neighboring|_|02 country|_|04 . it is odd|_|05 that an elephant|_|02 can literally|_|01 walk|_|01 away|_|10 from its protection|_|06 by wandering|_|12 into the neighboring|_|02 country|_|04 . i was not aware|_|01 of any of this . the article|_|02 somewhat|_|01 jokingly|_|01 said|_|11 that elephants|_|02 do not have passports|_|02 .
hey , did you read|_|06 this article|_|04 ? south|_|05 korea|_|01 always|_|01 seems|_|03 to have something going|_|03 on . 26|_|01 were hospitalized|_|01 and 29|_|01 were treated|_|05 at the scene|_|01 . it seems|_|03 like|_|02 more and more often|_|03 this kind|_|01 of thing|_|05 is happening|_|01 . there has to be a better|_|13 way|_|01 of getting|_|03 points|_|03 across|_|02 without injuries|_|04 . it 's crazy|_|03 and really|_|01 unnecessary|_|01 to cause|_|01 harm|_|01 for this .
wow|_|02 , a teacher|_|02 get|_|01 pregnant|_|01 after having sex|_|03 numerous|_|01 times|_|04 with an 8ht grader|_|01 pleads|_|03 guilty|_|02 to a lesser|_|01 charge|_|15 of aggravated|_|02 sexual|_|02 assault|_|03 of a child|_|01 . this is unreal|_|02 and aggravates|_|02 me that teachers|_|02 would do this and children|_|01 would go|_|03 along|_|04 with it . the world|_|01 needs|_|02 to worry|_|06 less|_|02 about wants|_|05 , quit|_|04 being emotionally|_|02 and physically|_|01 weak|_|01 and focus|_|05 on needs|_|02 , not wants|_|05 . this whole|_|02 story|_|01 ii|_|01 pathetic|_|01 and all involved|_|01 have ruined|_|02 their own lives|_|01 and for what , pleasure|_|05 ? they 're all weak|_|01 .
it 's shocking|_|03 how little|_|01 people|_|03 care|_|02 about this and how little|_|01 africa|_|01 gets|_|14 mentioned|_|01 in the news|_|01 . this is horrific|_|02 when you think|_|03 about the number|_|07 of victims|_|02 and the people|_|03 who are harmed|_|01 . i wish|_|02 people|_|03 could focus|_|02 on this . it 's ridiculous|_|02 that people|_|03 are getting|_|14 away|_|01 with this and it is a huge|_|01 crisis|_|02 on the level|_|01 of other genocides|_|01 in history|_|05 .
friends|_|03 and family|_|06 - we need|_|03 to lobby|_|01 for president|_|02 trump|_|02 to take|_|01 global|_|01 warming|_|01 more seriously|_|01 . as predicted|_|01 , the temperature|_|01 may|_|01 rise|_|08 in the near|_|01 future|_|03 by one|_|05 point|_|07 five|_|01 degrees|_|06 celsius|_|01 . this will drastically|_|01 change|_|02 our weather|_|01 and therefore|_|01 cause|_|01 disastrous|_|06 effects|_|01 to many|_|01 , many|_|01 places|_|01 around|_|04 the world|_|01 . this can all be stopped|_|05 though|_|01 if we get|_|02 on board|_|09 now !
so trump|_|02 's guy|_|03 of scouts|_|04 is anti|_|01 lente|_|01 . he 's so far|_|04 off the mark|_|05 its insane|_|01 . wants|_|01 to outlaw|_|01 gay|_|01 sex|_|01 basically|_|01 . like|_|02 , who is gon na|_|01 enforce|_|02 what happens|_|01 in someones|_|01 bedroom|_|01 ? i ca|_|01 nt|_|01 with this administration|_|02 anymore|_|01 . where will it end|_|04 ? just let|_|02 people|_|01 love|_|02 who they want|_|01 ... crazy|_|03 homophones|_|01 are gon na|_|01 make|_|02 america|_|01 a whole|_|02 new|_|11 version|_|01 of hell|_|06
here is another|_|01 example|_|01 of domestic|_|01 gun|_|02 violence|_|03 that is happening|_|01 in america|_|01 . i know|_|05 that you feel|_|05 very strongly|_|01 about this issue|_|02 and figured|_|01 that you might|_|01 want|_|01 to read|_|03 this article|_|04 that i found|_|03 . it is such a sad|_|02 story|_|02 , and until we get|_|01 the guns|_|02 off the street|_|03 , these stories|_|02 are just going|_|04 to keep|_|02 coming|_|04 up .
" the fact|_|03 that all trump|_|02 has to say|_|01 when asked|_|02 about his|_|01 supporters|_|01 being violent|_|01 is " " stop|_|05 it . " " is laughable|_|02 . yet|_|01 when he is asked|_|02 his|_|01 opinion|_|01 on minorities|_|03 like|_|02 muslims|_|01 or hispanics|_|01 , he can go|_|01 on for days|_|05 . him and his|_|01 supporters|_|01 have worms|_|03 in their brains|_|01 or something . there 's no way|_|12 any logical|_|01 person|_|03 capable|_|02 of rationality|_|02 would agree|_|07 with half|_|01 the things|_|09 he says|_|01 . "
after reading|_|06 that article|_|02 on the arctic|_|02 ice|_|05 , i feel|_|05 that maybe|_|01 we should get|_|02 together|_|04 and do something . maybe|_|01 find|_|01 an organization|_|05 to donate|_|01 time|_|02 and money|_|01 too . i do n't know|_|03 , but it is scary|_|01 that the ice|_|05 is not rebounding|_|01 . i am not sure|_|07 what will happen|_|03 in the future|_|01 , but if we can try|_|08 to get|_|02 people|_|01 aware|_|01 now of their carbon|_|01 footprint|_|01 , maybe|_|01 , just maybe|_|01 we can make|_|08 a small|_|02 impact|_|01 on the ice|_|05 melting|_|09 . i know|_|03 the earth|_|05 goes|_|03 through cycles|_|01 , but i am sure|_|07 that humans|_|02 have greatly|_|01 impacted|_|01 the amount|_|02 of thawing|_|09 way|_|01 more than normal|_|04 cycles|_|01 . it is as if humans|_|02 are a parasite|_|01 . we are like|_|02 a chronic|_|02 inflammation|_|03 to the earth|_|05 . it 's getting|_|02 scary|_|01 out there and we have no other planet|_|01 to go|_|03 to in this vast|_|01 universe|_|03 . we ca|_|01 n't mess|_|02 up the one|_|01 we have .
this article|_|04 was quite|_|03 interesting|_|01 to me . it talked|_|01 about the invention|_|03 of a new|_|12 male|_|03 contraceptive|_|01 . it talks|_|01 about the potential|_|01 side|_|09 effects|_|02 that steer|_|02 men|_|01 away|_|02 from using|_|06 the contraceptive|_|01 . the writer|_|01 of the article|_|04 mocks|_|01 men|_|01 for avoiding|_|01 these contraceptives|_|01 when female|_|03 contraceptives|_|01 have way|_|01 more side|_|01 effects|_|02 to them . i personally|_|03 disagree|_|02 with the writer|_|01 - if male|_|03 contraceptives|_|01 were invented|_|01 before female|_|03 contraceptives|_|01 , i believe|_|01 that males|_|01 would have no problem|_|01 using|_|06 them despite|_|02 the side|_|09 effects|_|02 . what are your thoughts|_|01 ?
since you moved|_|01 to anchorage|_|04 , i ’m sure|_|07 you’be been aware|_|01 of all the unsolved|_|01 homicides|_|01 that have occurred|_|01 . just wanted|_|05 to say|_|01 “ stay|_|04 safe|_|01 ” . hopefully|_|02 , that guy|_|01 that shot|_|01 at the police|_|01 officer|_|01 the other day|_|07 and whose gun|_|02 they say|_|01 was used|_|01 in some of those unsolved|_|01 cases|_|01 , was the killer|_|01 . if so , his|_|01 reign|_|03 of terror|_|04 is over . how sad|_|01 that those people|_|01 died|_|01 for what appears|_|02 to be just being in the wrong|_|01 place|_|01 at the wrong|_|01 time|_|01 . i just do n’t understand|_|04 how someone|_|01 can take|_|35 the life|_|03 of another|_|01 unless their own life|_|03 is being threatened|_|02 . who knows|_|01 though|_|01 ? the killer|_|01 could be mentally|_|01 ill|_|05 and think|_|09 that perfect|_|01 strangers|_|02 are threatening|_|02 them ! anyway|_|01 , keep|_|02 your eyes|_|05 open|_|05 and be careful|_|01 !
this makes|_|43 me feel|_|05 nothing|_|01 . i do n't care|_|01 about this . i do n't see|_|05 why i have to care|_|01 about this . bad|_|01 things|_|11 like|_|02 this happen|_|02 all the time|_|02 and they have no affect|_|01 on me . i have too many|_|01 problems|_|01 of my own to have to worry|_|02 about more things|_|11 like|_|02 this . thinking|_|02 about this kind|_|01 of stuff|_|05 just adds|_|06 to my stress|_|04 .
it 's a shame|_|02 that we have so many|_|01 random|_|01 acts|_|04 of violence|_|01 in this country|_|04 . it seems|_|02 every|_|02 other week|_|01 we have some massacre|_|03 involving|_|05 either|_|01 guns|_|02 , a right|_|12 wing|_|08 extremist|_|01 or a muslim|_|01 extremist|_|01 . i think|_|01 what they have in common|_|06 are either|_|01 mentally|_|01 ill|_|05 people|_|01 or people|_|01 who are extremist|_|01 in their world|_|08 views|_|03 and religion|_|02 .
i 'm sorry|_|01 to hear|_|02 that about dakota|_|03 's parents|_|01 . even|_|03 when you are adult|_|01 it must|_|01 be hard|_|11 to see|_|01 your parents|_|01 splitting|_|09 up . no one|_|02 wants|_|01 that to happen|_|04 and it 's unfortunate|_|03 that her parents|_|01 could n't work|_|01 it out . i hope|_|03 they are able|_|01 to still|_|04 remain|_|04 civil|_|02 around|_|07 the kids|_|02 and family|_|02 . just because it did n't work|_|01 romantically|_|02 does n't mean|_|04 it wo n't work|_|01 at all .
i feel|_|05 really|_|01 concerned|_|02 that they have no idea|_|01 who committed|_|01 this crime|_|02 . i wonder|_|03 if there 's more to this story|_|02 . i wonder|_|03 what the conditions|_|03 were that led|_|05 up to this event|_|03 . i hope|_|02 the victims|_|02 will make|_|24 a full|_|06 recovery|_|03 and that they catch|_|24 this horrible|_|03 person|_|01 ! my thoughts|_|01 are with them and their families|_|01 !
just another|_|01 fucked|_|01 up mental|_|05 sickness|_|02 of american|_|01 police|_|01 against its black|_|04 residents|_|01 , i honestly|_|01 have no idea|_|01 why they have to be so sensitive|_|05 with their fucking|_|01 guns|_|02 , they shoot|_|01 people|_|01 as if people|_|01 can re spawn|_|01 after being shot|_|01 or something , police|_|01 should think|_|01 twice|_|01 before taking|_|06 out people|_|01 's lives|_|05 with no legitimate|_|03 reason|_|02 , i guess|_|02 it 's good|_|17 that police|_|01 have body|_|02 cam|_|02 , so the public|_|02 can see|_|02 what shame|_|02 they are bribing|_|01 upon themselves
it may|_|01 make|_|07 me sound|_|17 horrible|_|03 , but i 'm torn|_|02 on this . no one|_|02 should have to suffer|_|11 like|_|02 that for the crime|_|02 of theft|_|01 , it 's barbaric|_|02 , but if it really|_|01 was a twenty|_|01 - something that was part|_|09 of an armed|_|02 gang|_|04 , i 'm slightly|_|01 less|_|02 sympathetic|_|05 about their victims|_|02 retaliating|_|02 . if it was a child|_|04 , however|_|01 , this is insanity|_|01 and just horrifying|_|02 .
there is something very , very wrong|_|05 with someone|_|01 who thinks|_|09 nothing|_|01 of hurting|_|06 a fellow|_|06 human|_|03 being . how heartless|_|02 someone|_|01 must|_|01 also|_|02 be to take|_|03 the life|_|11 of another|_|01 human|_|03 no one|_|02 has the bloody|_|01 right|_|02 to take|_|03 . and how rotten|_|03 one|_|05 must|_|01 be to hurt|_|06 an innocent|_|05 animal|_|01 that is without sin|_|01 and any capability|_|02 of purposely|_|01 doing harm|_|03 .
i 'm the last|_|07 one|_|06 to want|_|05 to victim|_|02 blame|_|02 anyone . i think|_|05 as a celebrity|_|01 you have to be a bit|_|04 more conscious|_|03 of your actions|_|01 . do i think|_|05 kim by posting|_|07 the pics|_|01 made|_|02 someone|_|01 want|_|02 to rob|_|01 her ? no , but i think|_|05 it 's probably|_|01 best|_|02 to be more modest|_|04 about what you post|_|07 . i mean|_|04 , just for safeties|_|01 sake|_|01 . i agree|_|01 , i 'd be scared|_|01 to post|_|07 about tristan|_|01 's ring|_|02 too especially|_|01 since it was n't so long|_|02 ago|_|01 that kim was robbed|_|01 . yes|_|01 , i 'm sure|_|07 everything is insured|_|10 , but it 's still|_|01 a scary|_|01 experience|_|01 and i 'd do everything i could to avoid|_|01 it .
i am one|_|06 for not giving|_|01 your potential|_|01 mate|_|09 any reasonable|_|03 doubt|_|02 . for example|_|04 if tan|_|02 aka ( maria|_|02 carey 's backup|_|04 dancer|_|02 ) made|_|03 her fiance|_|01 uncomfortable|_|01 he should have been axed|_|01 in the beginning|_|01 of the relationship|_|03 . i also|_|02 do not think|_|03 it supports|_|02 security|_|03 all the time|_|01 either|_|01 . i think|_|03 that if you value|_|06 that mate|_|03 there should definitely|_|01 be sacrifices|_|03 made|_|03 in regards|_|03 with relationships|_|03 .
avoid|_|02 reading|_|02 this article|_|04 . it 's so fucking|_|01 long|_|01 for saying|_|01 so little|_|02 . the author|_|01 feels|_|05 the need|_|02 to go|_|01 on and on about irrelevant|_|01 details|_|04 and it comes|_|04 off as the ramblings|_|12 of a skit|_|01 out on the street|_|05 corner|_|04 . it 's the same nonsense|_|01 the media|_|02 pushes|_|05 about those poor|_|06 kids|_|01 , but does n't delve|_|01 into how none|_|02 of this shit|_|01 would have happened|_|01 if people|_|01 were responsible|_|02 and did n't make|_|43 shit|_|04 choices|_|02 that are obviously|_|01 bad|_|01 .
" i ca|_|01 n't believe|_|01 this article|_|04 that i just read|_|06 . they are making|_|43 these allegations|_|02 of homophobia|_|01 and all kinds|_|01 of crazy|_|05 notions|_|04 of hatred|_|01 against gays|_|01 , etc . what do they expect|_|01 people|_|01 to think|_|02 when every|_|02 time|_|06 we hear|_|02 of a bombing|_|02 , it is a muslim|_|01 . do they expect|_|01 people|_|01 to say|_|11 thank|_|01 you ? i do n't hear|_|02 any islamic|_|01 leaders|_|02 speaking|_|02 out against any of the terrorism|_|01 . are we just to sit|_|02 back|_|04 and say|_|11 " " thank|_|01 you sir|_|02 , may|_|01 i have another|_|01 . " " not only do i not hear|_|02 any islamic|_|01 leaders|_|02 speaking|_|02 out against it , i do n't hear|_|02 any muslim|_|01 citizens|_|01 speaking|_|02 out either|_|01 . as to the gay|_|01 and transgender|_|01 stuff|_|05 , i will speak|_|02 out against whomever i wish|_|03 . they have a right|_|04 to spew|_|02 their immoral|_|01 acts|_|04 all of the place|_|01 , then i have the right|_|04 to speak|_|02 out against their immoral|_|01 acts|_|04 which are an affront|_|02 to almighty|_|01 god|_|01 "
why do people|_|01 hurt|_|02 harmless|_|01 animals|_|01 ? it does n't make|_|02 sense|_|01 to me honestly|_|02 . i look|_|02 into the eyes|_|05 of an animal|_|01 and i ca|_|01 n't help|_|01 thinking|_|01 that they do n't fully|_|01 understand|_|03 why we would hurt|_|02 them either|_|01 . i think|_|01 it 's so cruel|_|01 that people|_|01 do this to animals|_|01 because they trust|_|06 us|_|01 to keep|_|04 them safe|_|02 it does n't matter|_|02 if they 're wild|_|01 or not . this poor|_|01 elephant|_|02 that was chained|_|02 up , and beaten|_|02 , and made|_|02 to do tricks|_|01 just for our amusement|_|01 .
this always|_|02 makes|_|02 me mad|_|02 guys|_|03 , that the cops|_|05 think|_|02 they can shoot|_|03 because of color|_|07 . its absolutely|_|02 ridiculous|_|03 ! of course|_|04 , the cop|_|05 is n't being charged|_|03 for murder|_|01 , and prejudiced|_|02 still|_|04 stands|_|08 in this country|_|04 . it is extremely|_|01 sad|_|02 that the world|_|08 has to come|_|01 to this .. just killing|_|01 off anybody because they think|_|02 they 're above the law|_|01 .
ugh . that 's rough|_|02 . i feel|_|13 so bad|_|01 for that little|_|02 girl|_|02 and she deserves|_|01 to live|_|01 in a world|_|03 where justice|_|02 is made|_|33 , but that eye|_|05 - for - an - eye|_|05 type|_|06 justice|_|02 is so medieval|_|01 . the guy|_|03 obviously|_|01 deserves|_|01 a very harsh|_|02 punishment|_|01 , but this is barbaric|_|02 . this is the difference|_|04 between revenge|_|01 and justice|_|02 . a 20|_|01 - year|_|03 prison|_|01 sentence|_|01 makes|_|33 so much|_|01 more sense|_|03 than blinding|_|02 .
i like|_|02 some of these new|_|06 approaches|_|03 to reducing|_|01 the harmful|_|01 effects|_|05 of bullying|_|01 , but it 's still|_|04 not enough|_|01 . just having a shocking|_|01 video|_|01 that raises|_|10 awareness|_|01 does n't help|_|01 the problem|_|02 from starting|_|02 , just helps|_|01 us|_|01 react|_|03 to it quicker|_|01 . we need|_|02 to keep|_|04 building|_|01 programs|_|01 that are designed|_|03 to support|_|01 our children|_|04 , but we need|_|02 to do it before they start|_|02 to bully|_|02 ( or be bullied|_|02 ) . so many|_|01 of our anti|_|01 - bullying|_|01 stories|_|01 talk|_|05 about standing|_|03 up to them and bullying|_|02 back|_|06 ... that is not the way|_|01 !
i thought|_|10 this was a pretty|_|01 interesting|_|01 article|_|04 . i learned|_|01 some things|_|09 about music|_|05 and lawsuits|_|01 . it might|_|01 be relevant|_|01 to some of what you and i were talking|_|02 about some time|_|02 ago|_|01 . in any case|_|04 , it has some new|_|08 facts|_|02 that have come|_|04 to light|_|01 , as it were , new|_|08 information|_|02 or opinions|_|01 that i had not fully|_|01 considered|_|01 prior|_|02 to reading|_|03 this article|_|04 .
i tend|_|03 to be very hard|_|01 - heated|_|04 when it comes|_|04 to issues|_|06 of immigration|_|02 . yet|_|04 this is a man|_|01 for who all intents|_|01 and purposes|_|01 is an american|_|02 , raised|_|02 here from the age|_|01 of three|_|02 and facing|_|01 deportation|_|03 for missed|_|01 paperwork|_|01 ? this is quite|_|04 frankly|_|01 a steaming|_|01 pile|_|01 of bullshit|_|01 . there are those who come|_|04 here , infest|_|03 neighborhoods|_|04 and take|_|01 away|_|10 jobs|_|02 from hard|_|01 working|_|02 americans|_|01 and then there are victims|_|02 of bureaucratic|_|01 anarchy|_|01 - tyranny|_|01 like|_|02 this . these types|_|06 of scenarios|_|02 are unacceptable|_|04 . i tend|_|03 to believe|_|05 that a system|_|02 that will let|_|01 the guilty|_|02 go|_|01 free|_|03 is preferable|_|01 to one|_|01 that will punish|_|01 even|_|03 one|_|01 innocent|_|01 man|_|01 . men|_|01 like|_|02 this deserve|_|01 to be treated|_|03 as americans|_|01 , because they are .
i ’m glad|_|01 that i do n’t work|_|01 at well|_|05 ’s fargo|_|01 . to think|_|03 that they would push|_|02 their employees|_|01 to the brink|_|02 of suicide|_|02 and having mental|_|05 health|_|02 issues|_|02 is totally|_|01 ridiculous|_|03 . and all in the name|_|03 of the almighty|_|01 dollar|_|04 . i wish|_|02 companies|_|01 cared|_|02 more for their employees|_|01 , than their bottom|_|02 line|_|01 . i have worked|_|02 for a company|_|01 for over 30|_|01 years|_|03 and in the early|_|06 years|_|03 , the company|_|01 cared|_|02 about its employees|_|01 . they treated|_|05 us|_|01 like|_|02 family|_|08 . the last|_|04 ten|_|01 or fifteen|_|01 years|_|03 have been so difficult|_|01 . they could care|_|02 less|_|02 about their loyal|_|01 employees|_|01 . they treat|_|05 us|_|01 like|_|02 dirt|_|02 . all they care|_|02 about is how much|_|01 money|_|03 they can make|_|08 , never|_|02 caring|_|02 about how much|_|01 stress|_|01 they are putting|_|04 on their workers|_|01 . there has got|_|02 to be a better|_|02 way|_|11 . i ’m so glad|_|01 i will be retiring|_|10 in another|_|01 year|_|03 or so . i do n’t think|_|03 i could st
i think|_|03 timeshares are silly|_|01 and this article|_|03 just confirms|_|03 it . in the article|_|03 it talks|_|05 about how hard|_|01 it is for some people|_|03 to get|_|02 rid|_|01 of timeshares after they have them . timeshare salesmen|_|01 are so pushy|_|01 when you first|_|01 sign|_|07 up for one|_|06 i ca|_|01 n't imagine|_|02 how hard|_|01 it is to get|_|02 out of one|_|06 . i 'm just glad|_|01 that i do n't have a timeshare and never|_|02 will . i 'm sure|_|07 they have some many|_|01 tiny|_|01 provisions|_|01 in their contracts|_|02 that make|_|02 them really|_|01 difficult|_|02 to get|_|02 out of successfully|_|01 .
i just read|_|03 an article|_|04 about trump|_|02 protesters|_|03 that had fireworks|_|01 shot|_|08 at them . this story|_|03 breaks|_|02 my heart|_|01 . some of the protesters|_|03 also|_|02 were spit|_|03 on and endured|_|03 racial|_|01 slurs|_|02 . i do not understand|_|01 how a group|_|01 could commit|_|01 such a mean|_|06 act|_|04 of violence|_|01 . the group|_|01 that shot|_|08 the fireworks|_|01 were never|_|02 caught|_|03 , which makes|_|43 this story|_|03 even|_|04 worse|_|06 . people|_|01 should be able|_|01 to express|_|04 their views|_|07 in safety|_|01 .
this story|_|03 makes|_|18 me feel|_|05 upset|_|04 and aggravated|_|02 because i hate|_|01 that it is so easy|_|03 to obtain|_|02 guns|_|02 in this country|_|02 . i truly|_|01 believe|_|01 that there is no reason|_|06 for anyone to have a gun|_|02 and wish|_|02 that the laws|_|01 would change|_|01 to make|_|18 this the case|_|01 , so i always|_|01 feel|_|05 frustrated|_|02 reading|_|03 about random|_|01 shootings|_|02 . i hate|_|01 that we are subject|_|02 to everyone ease|_|02 's violent|_|03 whims|_|03 as long|_|02 as they can easily|_|01 purchase|_|01 a gun|_|02 , so that makes|_|18 me feel|_|05 angry|_|02 and also|_|02 worried|_|06 . i also|_|02 feel|_|05 sort|_|01 of exhausted|_|06 , since this happens|_|02 in the news|_|02 so much|_|01 it just feels|_|01 like|_|02 yet|_|04 another|_|01 shooting|_|01 story|_|03 i have to be aware|_|01 of , it 's tiring|_|02 .
jose fernandez was a pitcher|_|04 for the miami|_|02 marlins|_|01 and unfortunately|_|01 died|_|04 in a major|_|08 boating|_|01 accident|_|02 where they rammed|_|06 a rock|_|02 . i got|_|02 to read|_|06 more into his|_|01 life|_|01 and upbringing|_|01 and it 's truly|_|01 sad|_|02 to see|_|05 such a good|_|12 man|_|08 fall|_|01 in such a preventable|_|01 way|_|05 . i truly|_|01 feel|_|06 for all those who suffered|_|03 his|_|01 loss|_|03 . it 's such a sad|_|02 event|_|01 and it 's stuff|_|01 like|_|04 this that makes|_|48 you be more appreciative|_|01 of the time|_|06 you have .
i am writing|_|03 to you regarding|_|05 the floods|_|02 in louisiana|_|01 , and all the displaced|_|02 residents|_|01 . i try|_|01 to put|_|01 myself in their position|_|01 , and wonder|_|02 what would be my hearts|_|02 desire|_|02 as to a viable|_|02 solution|_|02 . if it would be more beneficial|_|01 to relocate|_|02 to another|_|01 area|_|01 , where i can then begin|_|07 to rebuild|_|01 my life|_|02 , and replace|_|01 that which was destroyed|_|04 . however|_|01 there is an underlying|_|02 disadvantage|_|01 to louisiana|_|01 , as a whole|_|02 , if in the case|_|09 so many|_|01 would want|_|05 to leave|_|02 and relocate|_|02 . the state|_|02 is in a very difficult|_|01 and decisive|_|03 moment|_|01 , given|_|01 what they are faced|_|01 with . especially|_|01 in the areas|_|01 of unemployment|_|01 , on average|_|03 when someone|_|01 is having problems|_|02 finding|_|02 gainful|_|01 employment|_|03 , they will move|_|02 to another|_|01 location|_|03 for work|_|01 reasons|_|02 alone|_|02 , and nothing|_|01 to do with a natural|_|07 disaster|_|02 as louisiana|_|01 is faced|_|01 with .
this is disgusting|_|02 . as many|_|01 of you know|_|01 , i am an animal|_|01 lover|_|03 . there is not much|_|01 that makes|_|02 me sad|_|02 , upset|_|01 and angry|_|03 like|_|02 any instance|_|01 of an animal|_|01 suffering|_|09 . what this man|_|08 did is unforgivable|_|02 . i hope|_|03 he has a mental|_|05 illness|_|01 . i can not think|_|03 of any other reason|_|03 why someone|_|01 would do something so cruel|_|01 .
while this seems|_|04 like|_|02 good|_|20 news|_|01 that there are fewer and fewer cases|_|05 of erika i would be lying|_|05 if i said|_|01 it was n't still|_|04 alarming|_|02 . it seems|_|04 very strange|_|02 that such a huge|_|01 virus|_|03 with a widespread|_|01 development|_|01 and all of the media|_|02 attention|_|01 is now just a minor|_|10 issue|_|01 . it 's either|_|01 hiding|_|02 somewhere|_|01 are there 's worse|_|01 on the way|_|11 . or it could have all just been media|_|02 hype|_|01 to sell|_|02 tv|_|01 . hard|_|11 to say|_|01 but suspicious|_|01 all the same .
how can anyone , in this day|_|10 and age|_|01 , still|_|04 believe|_|01 that climate|_|02 change|_|09 is not real|_|02 ? i imagine|_|02 it 's the same people|_|03 who believe|_|01 the earth|_|04 is flat|_|01 . we should be working|_|02 towards clean|_|13 and renewable|_|02 energy|_|05 but of course|_|07 there are fights|_|01 all across|_|02 the way|_|01 because people|_|03 want|_|05 to make|_|45 money|_|03 . also|_|02 replacing|_|01 infrastructure|_|02 is hard|_|01 . but , that 's not an excuse|_|01 when you know|_|03 that entire|_|02 parts|_|01 of the country|_|04 might|_|01 expand|_|09 into a desert|_|01 . this is especially|_|01 true|_|09 of north|_|02 america|_|02 .
reading|_|03 about articles|_|02 like|_|02 this in a country|_|04 i font|_|01 care|_|02 about has no meaning|_|02 to me . in lower|_|02 class|_|03 worker|_|03 in the usa|_|01 . this kind|_|01 of stuff|_|01 makes|_|43 no difference|_|04 in my life|_|03 because i struggle|_|03 to even|_|03 feed|_|03 my kids|_|01 . people|_|01 facing|_|02 hardship|_|01 in other countries|_|04 is there problem|_|01 not mine|_|02 and i have no real|_|01 feeling|_|02 towards those people|_|01
it 's sad|_|02 the train|_|01 wreck|_|02 cost|_|01 4|_|01 people|_|03 their lives|_|01 . one|_|05 can only hope|_|03 none|_|02 of the injured|_|01 are critical|_|01 . it would be great|_|02 if they could find|_|01 the cause|_|02 of the accident|_|02 . if they do n't , who 's to say|_|01 it wo n't happen|_|01 again ? the statistics|_|01 could be even|_|03 worse|_|01 next|_|02 time|_|03 . wish|_|01 this could have been prevented|_|01 .
i am at shock|_|01 for what i have just read|_|06 . first|_|02 of all i would need|_|01 a lot|_|04 of time|_|06 to reflect|_|07 on what just transpired|_|05 in the article|_|04 i read|_|06 . please|_|03 when you read|_|06 this try|_|01 not to get|_|01 too sad|_|02 about it because it will get|_|01 you sad|_|02 . just try|_|01 to find|_|10 someone|_|01 you love|_|01 and hold|_|04 onto them because we should not take|_|02 for granted|_|02 what we have .
i do n't really|_|01 like|_|02 coconuts|_|03 , i think|_|03 everyone knows|_|01 that , but i still|_|04 think|_|03 that they play|_|02 a huge|_|01 role|_|03 in our ecosystem|_|01 . i do n't know|_|01 a lot|_|02 about coconuts|_|03 or what role|_|03 they play|_|02 in the environment|_|02 , but they 're really|_|01 important|_|05 for a lot|_|02 of economies|_|04 where they are grown|_|07 . i think|_|03 that the article|_|02 brings|_|01 up a good|_|17 point|_|23 by saying|_|01 that major|_|04 companies|_|03 that sell|_|07 coconut|_|03 water|_|01 should be the ones|_|02 trying|_|01 to look|_|02 for a solution|_|03 because they are being over sourced|_|01 due|_|01 to high|_|02 demand|_|01 for their products|_|01 , so i think|_|03 that they have a lot|_|02 of responsibility|_|03 to try|_|01 to be the ones|_|02 to fix|_|02 this dilemma|_|01 and solve|_|01 this coconut|_|03 crisis|_|02 . it just makes|_|02 me worried|_|01 about the environment|_|02 overall|_|01 because i really|_|01 worry|_|06 about global|_|01 warming|_|02 and i just really|_|01 worry|_|06 about the environment|_|02 in general|_|02 .
i ca|_|01 n't even|_|01 begin|_|09 to put|_|07 myself in the shoes|_|02 of someone|_|01 who has to deal|_|02 with preparing|_|02 to die|_|01 half|_|02 a dozen|_|01 times|_|02 , and then once again , it 's halted|_|03 , because people|_|01 above him argue|_|03 over semantics|_|02 . yes|_|01 , he did do something wrong|_|01 , and deserves|_|01 what he is given|_|01 , but bureaucracy|_|03 goes|_|03 a little|_|02 too far|_|03 in how much|_|01 they can control|_|10 a persons|_|01 feelings|_|02 and life|_|08 .
heck no , this is one|_|03 of those topics|_|02 that i could talk|_|01 about for hours|_|04 and hours|_|04 . it is so stressful|_|01 the fact|_|04 that animals|_|01 are traded|_|02 like|_|02 that , just unbearable|_|01 . people|_|01 who do that , should be the ones|_|02 in the cages|_|01 . they are not even|_|04 humans|_|02 , they are monsters|_|01 . and of course|_|04 they have to find|_|01 a way|_|01 to teach|_|01 the countries|_|04 what to do when they face|_|03 this type|_|06 of situations|_|03 . and they better|_|17 do it quick|_|01 .
this is a sad|_|02 story|_|02 . there is a rhino|_|01 orphanage|_|02 , but a beloved|_|01 rhino|_|01 just passed|_|01 about . they tried|_|01 so hard|_|01 to save|_|08 this rhino|_|01 , and unfortunately|_|01 the baby|_|04 rhino|_|01 named|_|05 hula|_|01 is the area|_|01 that this happened|_|01 in . it never|_|02 gets|_|03 easier|_|01 . the other rhinos|_|01 here are being taken|_|15 care|_|02 of , but it was a great|_|01 loss|_|04 , and we all feel|_|04 so bad|_|01 about it . the name|_|04 of the baby|_|04 rhino|_|01 was indivisibly , and she will be missed|_|05 .
i just read|_|03 this article|_|04 about the doom|_|01 of bananas|_|02 that made|_|43 me feel|_|05 like|_|02 an idiot|_|01 . i like|_|02 to think|_|03 i am smart|_|12 enough|_|01 to process|_|03 this type|_|06 of article|_|04 but the words|_|07 used|_|01 just had me lost|_|07 . i would n't bother|_|01 reading|_|03 it if you still|_|04 planned|_|02 on it . it was informative|_|01 but i felt|_|01 like|_|02 i was reading|_|03 a manual|_|03 .
in iraq|_|01 , islamic|_|01 state|_|02 militants|_|01 are kidnapping|_|01 thousands|_|01 of people|_|01 at gunpoint|_|24 to use|_|06 as shields|_|01 against the u.s.|_|01 takeover|_|02 as the militants|_|01 move|_|03 to their last|_|01 stronghold|_|01 of mosul|_|01 . this is something that complicates|_|02 the u.s.|_|01 airstrikes because it is not certain|_|07 how many|_|01 civilians|_|01 might|_|01 be injured|_|01 or killed|_|09 since they are being used|_|06 as shields|_|01 by the militants|_|01 . as the militants|_|01 are squeezed|_|02 tighter|_|14 and tighter|_|14 together|_|03 in their last|_|01 stronghold|_|01 , more and more villages|_|01 are suffering|_|11 , entire|_|04 villages|_|01 of people|_|01 are being taken|_|09 and used|_|06 as these shields|_|01 . it is a terrible|_|01 situation|_|01 and i can not imagine|_|02 the suffering|_|11 as people|_|01 are missing|_|01 and lost|_|05 forever|_|02 from families|_|01 and leaving|_|12 many|_|01 children|_|02 as orphans|_|01 .
so a man|_|08 murdered|_|01 someone|_|01 over a card|_|08 being declined|_|01 . at a starbucks of course|_|09 , this is just getting|_|02 to be ridiculous|_|03 . someone|_|01 gets|_|02 pussy|_|01 because they have no money|_|03 and decide|_|03 to hurt|_|06 someone|_|01 else|_|03 that has nothing|_|01 to do with it . the more news|_|04 articles|_|04 i read|_|03 like|_|02 this , the less|_|03 faith|_|02 i have in humanity|_|08 .
this is a big|_|08 price|_|01 for reality|_|03 shows|_|03 featuring|_|01 filthy|_|01 rich|_|11 people|_|01 who care|_|02 more about being seen|_|01 than being safe|_|02 . i 'm sorry|_|01 , i ca|_|01 n't feel|_|05 too bad|_|09 for guardianship|_|05 west|_|08 for being robbed|_|01 , with so much|_|01 tempting|_|06 loot|_|01 around|_|07 . it must|_|01 have been frightening|_|01 for her to be tied|_|03 up , but if i were that rich|_|11 , i certainly|_|01 would not flaunt|_|01 it .
i hate|_|01 when these type|_|01 of things|_|05 happen|_|02 . i mean|_|04 , we trust|_|06 these people|_|01 with our information|_|05 , private|_|01 information|_|05 , and somehow|_|02 it just gets|_|02 hacked|_|03 ? someone|_|01 obtained|_|01 it and now is threat|_|02 hing to sell|_|02 it to the public|_|02 ? this is unbearable|_|01 right|_|07 now . they should have a secure|_|03 way|_|01 to protect|_|02 the information|_|05 we provide|_|03
it sounds|_|06 like|_|02 someone|_|01 did n't do their job|_|01 at all in dealing|_|01 with this housing|_|02 complex|_|03 . it sounds|_|06 like|_|02 a horrible|_|03 situation|_|03 but not a surprising|_|01 one|_|02 in a lot|_|04 of these countries|_|04 that lack|_|06 housing|_|02 laws|_|01 and standards|_|05 and accountability|_|01 . i really|_|01 hope|_|02 they are able|_|04 to rescue|_|02 anyone still|_|04 alive|_|08 but trapped|_|01 . on a weird|_|02 note|_|03 , what was with the blurb|_|01 about the chicken|_|01 ? that was random|_|01 .
this is just sick|_|01 . it kills|_|01 me that this lady|_|03 is a parent|_|01 . i am more confused|_|05 that the step|_|01 - father|_|01 had no idea|_|01 . i doubt|_|02 after moving|_|01 to multiple|_|01 houses|_|01 that you would not have noticed|_|04 something was off . i mean|_|04 you never|_|02 went|_|15 into these closets|_|01 ? the biggest|_|01 issue|_|01 here though|_|01 is that this woman|_|01 thought|_|09 she would rid|_|01 herself of a problem|_|01 because of social|_|05 services|_|01 checking|_|10 in on her . it is disgusting|_|02 . i am surprised|_|02 the other kids|_|02 survived|_|01 . they all must|_|01 have lived|_|01 in fear|_|03 of this lady|_|03 . makes|_|01 me so mad|_|01 people|_|01 kill|_|01 kids|_|02 .
people|_|03 working|_|03 in financial|_|01 institutions|_|02 or banks|_|01 should be honest|_|02 and do what is morally|_|02 right|_|02 . workers|_|02 who opened|_|04 fake|_|02 accounts|_|01 should be fired|_|05 , that is unethical|_|01 . no one|_|01 would be expecting|_|01 such a huge|_|01 scam|_|01 at wells|_|05 fargo|_|01 . i am deeply|_|01 saddened|_|02 , i have an account|_|01 with wells|_|05 fargo|_|01 . i have to be paying|_|05 close|_|04 attention|_|01 to my account|_|01 , one|_|01 never|_|02 knows|_|10 when something will go|_|01 wrong|_|01 .
all in all the eu|_|01 have to help|_|05 the refugees|_|01 . we have to treat|_|05 people|_|03 like|_|02 we like|_|02 to be treated|_|05 . if there were a war|_|01 here we also|_|02 would be flee|_|01 . we are afraid|_|02 for violet|_|02 ’s so they otherwise|_|01 they would say|_|01 there . if they are in the eu|_|01 we have to make|_|43 sure|_|07 there are no arguments|_|01 , so we can still|_|01 have our peaceful|_|01 society|_|02 . and i am sure|_|07 that we have one|_|06 thing|_|09 in comment|_|02 , we all live|_|01 on the earth|_|05 .
i ca|_|01 n't believe|_|01 we live|_|02 in a world|_|08 where terrorism|_|01 — both domestic|_|04 and foreign|_|02 — are such a looming|_|04 threat|_|03 . being out in public|_|02 now more dangerous|_|02 than ever|_|03 , and it 's all because of the convoluted|_|01 sociological|_|01 web|_|01 of conservative|_|01 ideology|_|01 that has promoted|_|05 domestic|_|04 terrorism|_|01 in white|_|01 heterosexual|_|01 american|_|01 masculinity|_|02 and the xenophobia|_|01 that inspired|_|03 islamic|_|01 terrorism|_|01 . there 's just too damned|_|01 much|_|01 hate|_|01 in this world|_|08 , and hopefully|_|02 more people|_|01 will find|_|05 love|_|02 and nurturing|_|02 like|_|02 the author|_|01 of this book|_|01 found|_|05 while writing|_|07 about her trauma|_|02 .
nothing|_|01 is ever|_|01 comparable|_|02 to the support|_|11 of people|_|01 who are willingly|_|01 happy|_|01 to show|_|02 their support|_|11 and love|_|01 to trump|_|02 . although sometimes|_|01 it is hard|_|01 to think|_|01 how impossible|_|03 it is to agree|_|05 with what trump|_|02 's want|_|01 for the country|_|04 . supporting|_|01 this kind|_|01 of big|_|12 event|_|03 is always|_|01 remarkable|_|01 and will always|_|01 be remembered|_|01 by people|_|01 .
our president|_|02 party|_|04 people|_|03 are making|_|03 something stupid|_|01 on some occasions|_|03 , you see|_|10 ‘ silicon|_|01 valley|_|01 ’ stars|_|03 recount|_|01 being harassed|_|02 by donald trump|_|02 supporters|_|03 . some one|_|01 insulting|_|02 trump|_|02 and making|_|03 fight|_|05 with them , its not necessary|_|02 . unwanted|_|01 fights|_|05 and unwanted|_|01 speech|_|03 should be avoided|_|03 . because all are having responsible|_|02 position|_|01 and work|_|02 to do , at bar|_|07 doing nasty|_|02 things|_|12 no good|_|01 using|_|04 some people|_|03 name|_|03
i read|_|03 an article|_|04 about the hidden|_|03 ads|_|01 in online|_|01 media|_|02 and how it may|_|01 be affecting|_|01 children|_|02 . it was about how kids|_|02 see|_|08 ads|_|01 for junk|_|02 food|_|01 when they go|_|03 online|_|01 . they also|_|02 spend|_|01 a lot|_|05 of time|_|04 online|_|01 , especially|_|01 on youtube . the videos|_|01 on there are more influential|_|01 , since they are real|_|02 people|_|01 , and the ads|_|01 are more convincing|_|01 . the article|_|04 made|_|02 me not want|_|05 to let|_|01 the kids|_|02 watch|_|08 youtube or go|_|03 online|_|01 , which is really|_|01 hard|_|01 to do . i hate|_|01 that the advertising|_|01 industry|_|02 seems|_|02 to control|_|10 all of our online|_|01 media|_|02 .
the disgust|_|01 i have while reading|_|06 this story|_|03 . no one|_|02 should send|_|02 there child|_|02 to school|_|04 to learn|_|04 and have to worry|_|03 about sexual|_|02 assault|_|03 in any form|_|01 . she makes|_|02 other teachers|_|02 look|_|02 bad|_|01 . taking|_|06 a plea|_|02 deal|_|09 was her best|_|03 choice|_|02 . there is never|_|02 an acceptable|_|02 reason|_|02 for something like|_|02 this to happen|_|03 . the fact|_|03 she had a young|_|01 daughter|_|01 too is scary|_|01 .
i absolutely|_|02 hate|_|01 seeing|_|01 this kind|_|01 of violent|_|02 racism|_|02 in the world|_|08 . too many|_|01 people|_|01 think|_|01 that just because someone|_|01 is different|_|03 they are less|_|02 worthy|_|01 of life|_|13 than themselves . it is honestly|_|01 just terrible|_|01 . it feels|_|05 like|_|02 we are seeing|_|01 more and more of this everyday|_|03 . humans|_|02 really|_|01 need|_|03 to come|_|04 together|_|05 and realize|_|02 that we are all the same , and there is not reason|_|02 to cause|_|02 each other harm|_|01 and pain|_|02 such as this .
hey my best|_|03 friend|_|05 joseph|_|03 , how have you been ? do you believe|_|01 this ? there were thousands|_|01 of females|_|02 that left|_|01 work|_|01 in iceland|_|01 and went|_|01 to australasia|_|01 square|_|05 in the icelandic|_|01 capital|_|01 of reykjavik|_|01 to protest|_|03 , there is discrimination|_|02 against women|_|02 cause|_|02 they get|_|01 paid|_|07 way|_|09 less|_|02 then men|_|01 do . sucks|_|01 we are still|_|01 living|_|01 a society|_|03 where woman|_|02 are not created|_|03 or treated|_|08 fairly|_|01 .
it 's hard|_|01 to imagine|_|02 the life|_|03 of people|_|03 who left|_|02 everything they had – of course|_|07 , many|_|01 of them had already|_|01 lost|_|06 most of what they had – and started|_|03 impossibly|_|01 long|_|01 and complicated|_|02 journeys|_|01 to secure|_|03 a better|_|20 life|_|03 for themselves and their family|_|01 . imagine|_|02 having nothing|_|01 but the clothes|_|01 on your back|_|05 , not knowing|_|01 where your next|_|03 meal|_|01 is going|_|01 to come|_|04 from , but still|_|01 hoping|_|06 for a chance|_|01 to rebuild|_|01 your life|_|03 . it ’s heart|_|02 breaking|_|02 .
" i think|_|01 it is really|_|01 fucked|_|01 up that people|_|01 continue|_|02 to mess|_|02 with the environment|_|02 . corporations|_|07 and these oil|_|01 fuckers|_|01 should stopped|_|01 . they are damaging|_|02 the environment|_|02 to no end|_|14 ! someone|_|01 needs|_|02 to sit|_|01 down with ceo|_|01 and ask|_|04 them , " " why do you want|_|05 billions|_|02 if you wo n't be able|_|02 to enjoy|_|02 it in the future|_|03 when the environment|_|02 is completely|_|01 fucked|_|01 ? " " seriously|_|01 , where is a ceo|_|01 going|_|01 to travel|_|01 to enjoy|_|02 his|_|01 millions|_|02 and stay|_|09 at luxury|_|03 resort|_|02 villas|_|04 when the environment|_|02 is completely|_|01 fucked|_|01 ? the luxury|_|03 resort|_|02 will be gone|_|01 ! ! his|_|01 wealth|_|01 will end|_|01 up amounting|_|15 to nothing|_|01 when he ca|_|01 n't even|_|01 enjoy|_|02 it . his|_|01 future|_|03 children|_|03 will have millions|_|02 passed|_|01 down but they wo n't fully|_|01 enjoy|_|02 it because the planet|_|02 will be fucked|_|01 ! what the fuck|_|01 ? these people|_|01 are morally|_|02 fucking|_|01 bankrupt|_|01 , only bankrupt|_|01 they 'll ever|_|03 know|_|01 . "
i could care|_|01 less|_|02 what isis|_|01 does as long|_|01 its not done in my country|_|04 . i think|_|09 they should all be put|_|01 to death|_|01 and be done with it . they are a terrorist|_|01 group|_|03 and deserve|_|01 all the bad|_|01 things|_|11 that are going|_|04 to happen|_|02 to them . i do feel|_|04 bad|_|01 for the lose|_|01 of life|_|01 and feel|_|04 sympathy|_|02 for the families|_|06 of the officers|_|01 killed|_|01 .
nothing|_|01 gets|_|01 to me more than hearing|_|02 about hungry|_|01 children|_|02 . nobody|_|04 should go|_|10 hungry|_|01 . there 's so much|_|01 food|_|01 in this world|_|03 . it breaks|_|08 my heart|_|01 to hear|_|02 about kids|_|02 fainting|_|01 in school|_|07 because they 've only had one|_|05 meal|_|01 for the day|_|01 . i wish|_|04 there was a way|_|11 to help|_|05 these kids|_|02 more directly|_|01 . i 'm not one|_|05 to give|_|14 to large|_|01 non|_|01 - profit|_|01 organizations|_|06 but i feel|_|13 so bad|_|01 for these kids|_|02 .
after reading|_|03 this story|_|03 i think|_|03 the right|_|04 decision|_|01 was made|_|02 . it seems|_|04 to me that the man|_|08 had no reason|_|01 to shoot|_|02 at those kids|_|01 just because they were playing|_|02 loud|_|01 music|_|05 . sure|_|07 music|_|05 can be annoying|_|01 but no one|_|01 deserves|_|01 to be shot|_|01 over it . i do n't think|_|03 that any changes|_|01 need|_|02 to be made|_|02 to the stand|_|04 your ground|_|01 laws|_|01 . this was a simple|_|07 case|_|06 of someone|_|01 making|_|02 poor|_|02 choices|_|02 and now needs|_|02 to pay|_|09 the price|_|06 for their actions|_|01 .
as much|_|01 as i love|_|01 dogs|_|01 i must|_|01 say|_|01 this was totally|_|01 the owners|_|02 fault|_|01 . the rule|_|11 was the dog|_|01 needed|_|02 to be on a leash|_|01 . the woman|_|02 did not follow|_|02 the rules|_|11 and the dog|_|01 ran|_|05 over to a stranger|_|02 . the dog|_|01 scared|_|01 the stranger|_|02 as is expected|_|04 . i have had many|_|01 big|_|12 scary|_|01 dogs|_|01 running|_|05 towards me and was n't sure|_|08 if it was going|_|01 to attack|_|05 me or be nice|_|03 . the man|_|08 got|_|01 scared|_|10 and shot|_|08 the dog|_|01 . its sad|_|02 but the man|_|08 did not know|_|01 if the dog|_|01 was going|_|01 to attack|_|05 him .
i think|_|09 it is a shame|_|02 that people|_|01 still|_|04 lose|_|06 their lives|_|02 on trails|_|02 . some do not appreciate|_|02 the dangers|_|02 of mother|_|05 nature|_|04 and try|_|01 to best|_|02 her without realizing|_|02 what they are up against . it is always|_|02 important|_|01 to prepare|_|02 before you go|_|01 out on a hike|_|09 . without understanding|_|02 what you are doing , a person|_|01 could easily|_|03 end|_|01 up lost|_|06 or dead|_|01 .
it 's such a shame|_|02 that so much|_|01 violence|_|03 takes|_|01 place|_|01 over there each year|_|03 . you 'd think|_|13 all the different|_|03 factions|_|02 would finally|_|01 agree|_|01 to disagree|_|01 and move|_|01 on but instead|_|01 they just seem|_|02 to want|_|01 to keep|_|02 killing|_|02 . i understand|_|04 why since so many|_|01 different|_|03 groups|_|03 want|_|01 to destroy|_|04 the other side|_|02 leaving|_|02 smaller|_|01 nations|_|04 like|_|02 yemen|_|01 to have to defend|_|02 themselves since the other factions|_|02 seem|_|02 to be unable|_|02 to leave|_|02 in peace|_|04 .
this article|_|02 about post|_|05 - traumatic|_|02 stress|_|01 disorder|_|01 is disturbing|_|11 on many|_|01 levels|_|07 . this country|_|04 really|_|01 does n't take|_|01 care|_|01 of our veterans|_|03 . not to mention|_|01 the fact|_|01 that vietnam|_|01 and iraq|_|01 were unnecessary|_|01 wars|_|01 in the first|_|01 place|_|01 . i worry|_|03 we 're headed|_|09 for another|_|01 war|_|01 , and with the va|_|01 in the state|_|04 that it 's in , how can they possibly|_|02 care|_|02 for more war|_|01 veterans|_|03 ? they ca|_|01 n't meet|_|07 the needs|_|02 of the ones|_|01 who already|_|01 need|_|01 help|_|01 . it 's heartbreaking|_|02 to imagine|_|02 these soldiers|_|02 re - experiencing|_|01 the war|_|01 over and over again . however|_|02 , i am glad|_|02 to hear|_|02 that there is help|_|01 for people|_|01 who have potsdam|_|01 . i remember|_|01 when we were kids|_|01 and first|_|01 hearing|_|01 about potsdam|_|01 in vietnam|_|01 vets|_|02 , it was thought|_|02 that no one|_|01 ever|_|01 recovered|_|04 from it . healing|_|02 is possible|_|01 , but the vets|_|02 have to find|_|10 the right|_|04 people|_|01 to help|_|01 them .

although coal|_|01 keels|_|03 i did learn|_|08 that coal|_|01 is important|_|01 for caseload energy|_|06 generation|_|01 , coal|_|01 plants|_|04 are safe|_|03 and easy|_|12 to maintain|_|04 and the fuel|_|01 can easily|_|01 be transported|_|02 and the residue|_|01 disposed|_|04 of . coal|_|01 ( with varying|_|04 qualities|_|01 ) is an abundant|_|01 resource|_|01 , available|_|01 to many|_|01 countries|_|01 within|_|02 their borders|_|03 . uranium|_|01 on the other hand|_|09 requires|_|01 a lot|_|05 more work|_|02 and safety|_|02 precautions|_|02 before reaching|_|02 a point|_|20 where it can be used|_|04 as nuclear|_|01 fuel|_|01 . india|_|01 is unfortunate|_|03 as usual|_|01 to be on the short|_|01 end|_|13 of the stick|_|03 .
i had no earthly|_|01 idea|_|03 wearing|_|02 contact|_|09 lenses|_|04 required|_|02 this amount|_|02 of discipline|_|02 in order|_|13 to avoid|_|03 potential|_|01 problems|_|01 . i would much|_|05 prefer|_|01 to stick|_|01 with glasses|_|01 . what particularly|_|01 concerns|_|04 me is the potential|_|01 for scarring|_|01 on the cornea|_|01 and any possible|_|01 loss|_|06 of visual|_|03 acuity|_|01 . frankly|_|01 , i do n't like|_|02 the idea|_|03 of sticking|_|01 something in my eye|_|05 to begin|_|09 with , and this has turned|_|10 me off from contact|_|09 lenses|_|04 forever|_|02 .
i feel|_|05 bad|_|01 for these sisters|_|03 ' family|_|01 . until we find|_|05 out more from the autopsy|_|01 report|_|03 though|_|01 , we probably|_|01 should n't jump|_|02 to conclusions|_|05 . i do n't know|_|04 much|_|05 about what could cause|_|02 pulmonary|_|02 edema|_|01 , but maybe|_|01 it was due|_|03 to something they both ate|_|01 , or an infection|_|07 that they both came|_|05 down with , or something unrelated|_|02 to foul|_|04 play|_|03 .
this article|_|04 is interesting|_|01 . i guess|_|02 there is risk|_|02 with everything and now men|_|01 conceived|_|01 through iv|_|01 may|_|01 have trouble|_|04 conceiving|_|01 themselves . i 'm glad|_|01 i did n't have to go|_|03 the iv|_|01 route|_|01 , although i guess|_|02 it 's not a sure|_|08 thing|_|08 that the men|_|01 conceived|_|01 through iv|_|01 will have a lower|_|01 sperm|_|01 count|_|03 , but i guess|_|02 the risk|_|02 is higher|_|01 . i do n't think|_|01 there are too many|_|01 people|_|01 that know|_|01 about this information|_|01 . it 's the first|_|06 time|_|04 i 've ever|_|01 heard|_|02 of it .
i think|_|01 its fine|_|01 that people|_|03 protest|_|03 . i dislike|_|01 president|_|02 trump|_|02 as much|_|04 as those protesters|_|01 . but what they are doing its wrong|_|05 . they ca|_|01 nt|_|01 be destroying|_|02 property|_|02 or been a menace|_|02 for other people|_|03 . guys|_|03 , do it peacefully|_|01 , that 's the best|_|03 way|_|11 to do things|_|05 , otherwise|_|01 you will get|_|02 arrested|_|07 and in trouble|_|06 .
wow|_|02 . so ... i sure|_|01 as fuck|_|01 do not have that much|_|01 to say|_|01 about that stupid|_|01 article|_|04 / news|_|04 story|_|03 . but , i guess|_|02 that i 'll try|_|01 to think|_|01 of something . it 's also|_|02 not at all something that i would share|_|01 or want|_|02 to share|_|01 with anyone that i know|_|01 . it 's not relevant|_|01 to me or the people|_|03 that i know|_|01 and care|_|02 about . it 's not something that i would just choose|_|01 to read|_|06 either|_|01 . ok|_|01 . have you seen|_|02 this article|_|04 about the dad|_|01 that killed|_|01 his|_|01 daughter|_|01 's molester|_|01 ? apparently|_|01 she was molested|_|01 when she was young|_|01 , the guy|_|03 went|_|05 to jail|_|01 for a year|_|03 and a half|_|01 and was let|_|02 out . many|_|01 years|_|03 later|_|01 , the dad|_|01 went|_|05 and shot|_|05 the guy|_|03 . that 's pretty|_|01 much|_|01 it . i do n't know|_|01 why i 'm sending|_|02 this to you , but what do you think|_|01 ? i think|_|01 that it was boring|_|02 and i was n't interested|_|01 in it at all .
i read|_|08 an article|_|04 about using|_|01 the internet|_|01 and computers|_|01 in the classroom|_|01 , and how it affects|_|01 kids|_|01 . the article|_|04 mainly|_|01 talked|_|02 about e|_|01 - rate|_|04 , a government|_|02 program|_|07 to subsidize|_|02 the internet|_|01 and broadband|_|02 access|_|04 . it said|_|01 that most classrooms|_|01 are now connected|_|07 , but the millions|_|02 of dollars|_|02 are still|_|04 being spent|_|02 . the program|_|07 seemed|_|04 to be wasting|_|01 a lot|_|02 of money|_|03 and was n't showing|_|08 good|_|13 results|_|02 . i agree|_|01 that just buying|_|05 computers|_|01 and being on the internet|_|01 does n't guarantee|_|03 that kids|_|01 are receiving|_|02 a good|_|13 education|_|01 .

the good|_|06 news|_|01 is we live|_|01 in a place|_|01 that does not have much|_|04 air|_|01 pollution|_|01 . the bad|_|01 news|_|01 is that people|_|03 that have lung|_|01 cancer|_|01 that is exposed|_|02 to air|_|01 pollution|_|01 may|_|01 have a shorter|_|10 survival|_|03 time|_|06 . air|_|01 pollution|_|01 kills|_|09 thousands|_|01 of people|_|03 each year|_|03 . researchers|_|01 claim|_|07 that the median|_|01 survival|_|03 for people|_|03 diagnosed|_|02 with early|_|01 stages|_|03 of lung|_|01 cancer|_|01 is expected|_|04 to live|_|01 3|_|01 times|_|06 shorter|_|10 amount|_|02 of time|_|06 than those that do not . of course|_|04 , we all should stay|_|04 away|_|01 from cigarette|_|01 smoke|_|01 but it is unfortunate|_|03 that we have air|_|02 pollution|_|01 . they can figure|_|01 out a way|_|01 to get|_|02 to the moon|_|01 but can not seem|_|02 to figure|_|01 out a way|_|01 to clean|_|04 our air|_|01 .

these poor|_|01 people|_|01 . i hope|_|03 the researchers|_|01 can find|_|01 a way|_|11 to help|_|01 them . the thought|_|01 that you ca|_|01 n't even|_|01 use|_|01 the water|_|03 that is deep|_|03 in the ground|_|02 due|_|02 to arsenic|_|02 contamination|_|03 is horrible|_|03 . this is a sign|_|11 of the times|_|04 , however|_|04 , and i believe|_|01 as populations|_|04 grow|_|01 , water|_|03 is going|_|03 to be a big|_|01 commodity|_|01 due|_|02 to the scarcity|_|01 of clean|_|04 water|_|03 .
i do n't like|_|02 the fact|_|03 that environmental|_|02 concerns|_|01 are still|_|04 a large|_|06 part|_|03 of our world|_|03 in which we live|_|05 but i believe|_|01 the higher|_|02 power|_|01 controls|_|02 this and that will keep|_|01 us|_|01 from ever|_|01 completely|_|01 overcoming|_|01 these issues|_|06 . it makes|_|43 me upset|_|04 to know|_|05 native|_|01 american|_|02 tribes|_|02 are being affected|_|01 by drought|_|02 to the point|_|01 of possibly|_|02 ceasing|_|01 to exist|_|02 . i have native|_|01 american|_|02 heritage|_|04 and feel|_|05 that this population|_|04 should be cared|_|01 for by our government|_|01 before segments|_|02 of third|_|01 world|_|03 countries|_|04 . i do n't like|_|02 the fact|_|03 that air|_|01 pollution|_|01 is a problem|_|01 or a salty|_|03 lake|_|03 is drying|_|01 up in iran|_|01 but i understand|_|02 our environment|_|02 is controlled|_|01 by god|_|01 . we , as a nation|_|04 , choose|_|01 our battles|_|01 sometimes|_|01 based|_|01 on the wrong|_|02 things|_|12 . taking|_|03 care|_|02 of the native|_|01 american|_|02 tribesman|_|01 should be a huge|_|01 priority|_|01 !
i had n't heard|_|02 about this and i find|_|02 it surprising|_|01 . i initially|_|01 thought|_|02 of the ecological|_|02 factor|_|01 so it 's a good|_|13 thing|_|08 that it was contained|_|05 . it 's worrisome|_|01 that people|_|01 are struggling|_|02 to find|_|02 gas|_|01 anywhere|_|01 . i imagine|_|02 those areas|_|01 do n't have good|_|13 options|_|02 for public|_|01 transportation|_|01 or anything . maybe|_|01 it will push|_|02 people|_|01 to get|_|02 smart|_|12 cars|_|01 or ride|_|02 bikes|_|01 .

while i do sympathize|_|02 with the plight|_|01 of back|_|03 people|_|03 and latest|_|01 police|_|01 violence|_|01 , i think|_|09 that they are not helping|_|03 the situation|_|06 by engaging|_|01 in violent|_|01 protests|_|03 that take|_|01 even|_|03 more lives|_|13 and create|_|03 a great|_|01 deal|_|06 of disturbance|_|01 in usa|_|01 ! these protests|_|03 ignite|_|01 racial|_|01 tensions|_|06 but will not bring|_|04 back|_|01 the lives|_|13 of innocent|_|01 victims|_|02 . what needs|_|01 to be done here is clamping|_|02 tight|_|02 on the police|_|01 force|_|04 - punishing|_|01 them appropriately|_|01 and in the harshest|_|01 of form|_|11 if they take|_|01 an innocent|_|01 life|_|13 or harass|_|02 black|_|02 people|_|03 for no reason|_|02 ! they need|_|01 to undergo|_|01 training|_|01 and psychological|_|01 evaluation|_|02 before being allowed|_|01 to go|_|01 out there and deal|_|03 with criminals|_|01 ! they need|_|01 to be psychologically|_|02 stable|_|03 and clear|_|09 of racial|_|01 bias|_|01 , otherwise|_|01 they are not suitable|_|01 for this job|_|01 !

hey , i think|_|01 you should be careful|_|01 around|_|01 the canons|_|01 burg|_|01 area|_|06 next|_|03 time|_|03 you visit|_|04 pennsylvania|_|01 . the crime|_|01 has been increasingly|_|01 more dangerous|_|02 within|_|02 the past|_|01 few years|_|03 . according|_|01 to this article|_|04 that i read|_|03 online|_|03 , a police|_|01 officer|_|01 was shot|_|01 to death|_|06 and another|_|01 police|_|01 officer|_|01 was injured|_|01 in an ambush|_|01 . i feel|_|05 that if you were to come|_|02 down to visit|_|04 the area|_|06 , then there would be something similar|_|01 happening|_|01 to other people|_|03 . ambushes|_|01 , riots|_|01 , and shootings|_|02 are all problems|_|01 occurring|_|02 in the area|_|06 . i feel|_|05 bad|_|01 for this city|_|01 as it has a chance|_|02 to redeem|_|03 itself as a great|_|01 city|_|01 ; however|_|01 , with all the criminal|_|03 activities|_|01 happening|_|01 , it makes|_|43 it difficult|_|01 to do that .
thinking|_|02 about water|_|01 contamination|_|03 is a scary|_|01 thought|_|01 . when that can effect|_|02 our children|_|04 it makes|_|02 things|_|12 even|_|03 worse|_|01 . the crisis|_|02 in flint|_|03 is unacceptable|_|04 and to hear|_|02 about the drinking|_|01 fountain|_|03 in chicago|_|03 makes|_|02 things|_|12 even|_|03 worse|_|01 . it makes|_|02 you think|_|02 that major|_|02 improvements|_|03 need|_|02 to made|_|02 across|_|02 the us|_|01 . new|_|01 laws|_|01 need|_|02 to be put|_|01 in place|_|01 to ensure|_|02 everyone is getting|_|02 healthy|_|04 water|_|01 .
i just heard|_|02 about more poaching|_|01 of rhinos|_|01 , animals|_|01 in general|_|02 ! this one|_|06 was a black|_|12 rhino|_|01 very old|_|01 , but what i do n't understand|_|03 is why people|_|01 are so money|_|03 focused|_|02 and are willing|_|01 to kill|_|07 for it ? out of all the ways|_|11 we could be making|_|08 money|_|03 why is killing|_|07 animals|_|01 something pretty|_|01 defenseless|_|02 if we just leave|_|06 them alone|_|02 , the main|_|03 focus|_|03 for money|_|03 for some ? i 've never|_|02 had a desire|_|03 to hurt|_|02 an animal|_|01 for any reason|_|03 , you ?
i just read|_|06 an article|_|04 about kids|_|02 being killed|_|02 on halloween|_|01 night|_|07 . it 's an awful|_|02 tragedy|_|02 that we need|_|03 to try|_|01 to prevent|_|02 . because someone|_|01 was driving|_|16 stupid|_|01 , kids|_|02 were killed|_|02 . halloween|_|01 is a time|_|02 to have responsible|_|02 fun|_|02 and some guy|_|03 took|_|15 it to the extremes|_|01 . it 's sad|_|02 , and i feel|_|05 for those parents|_|01 . no parent|_|01 should have to bury|_|01 their child|_|03 .
hey i feel|_|05 like|_|04 trump|_|02 winning|_|01 was way|_|11 worse|_|01 than people|_|03 thought|_|05 . the amount|_|02 of violent|_|01 attacks|_|05 on minorities|_|01 and in general|_|05 have increased|_|01 considerably|_|07 . there have been over 200|_|01 attacks|_|05 since election|_|04 day|_|01 can you imagine|_|02 that ? i hate|_|01 that trump|_|02 supporters|_|01 somehow|_|01 feel|_|05 vindicated|_|03 with their awful|_|02 racism|_|02 .
i do n't think|_|01 that it is fair|_|01 to compare|_|02 president|_|01 trump|_|02 to nazi|_|02 germany|_|01 or the holocaust|_|02 . i am not a fan|_|01 of president|_|01 trump|_|02 by any means|_|01 , but i also|_|02 have not once thought|_|01 about comparing|_|02 him to such a horrific|_|01 part|_|01 of the history|_|04 of this world|_|06 . jews|_|01 should not be worried|_|06 that there will be another|_|01 holocaust|_|02 or that they will have to go|_|03 back|_|03 into concentration|_|06 camps|_|08 . i do n't think|_|01 the country|_|04 would ever|_|03 let|_|01 that happen|_|01 again , and i do n't think|_|01 that donald trump|_|02 would go|_|03 down that road|_|02 either|_|01 . he has a tendency|_|04 to act|_|02 like|_|02 a child|_|01 , but that would be a far|_|05 stretch|_|03 , even|_|03 for him .
i heard|_|02 almost|_|07 80|_|01 people|_|03 died|_|04 from an explosion|_|04 . it was caused|_|01 by lightening|_|11 or something . crazy|_|01 huh ? i hope|_|03 nothing|_|01 like|_|02 that every|_|01 happens|_|01 here during a fuel|_|01 crisis|_|02 . over 100|_|01 were injured|_|01 . so sad|_|02 . i wonder|_|01 what all those people|_|03 who survived|_|01 are going|_|01 to do . maybe|_|01 the red|_|01 cross|_|04 will set|_|08 up something . how can i find|_|02 out ?
an animal|_|01 center|_|17 did not take|_|02 care|_|02 of animals|_|01 properly|_|01 . there was complaints|_|04 by an employee|_|01 about horrid|_|01 conditions|_|03 that the owner|_|02 did not do anything about . animal|_|01 centers|_|17 are not regulated|_|02 so the owners|_|02 do whatever|_|01 they want|_|01 without consequences|_|03 . dogs|_|01 died|_|04 of heat|_|01 exhaustion|_|03 because they were not supervised|_|01 and did not have proper|_|04 ventilation|_|01 in a room|_|04 known|_|01 to get|_|04 bey|_|02 hot|_|01 .
man|_|08 it crazy|_|02 i just read|_|08 an article|_|04 about a disaster|_|03 that struck|_|05 collation|_|03 , brazil|_|02 . the disaster|_|03 struck|_|05 when a dam|_|01 ruptured|_|01 and polluted|_|01 the most important|_|05 river|_|01 in brazil|_|02 where people|_|01 were getting|_|03 their foods|_|02 and surviving|_|01 from what the river|_|01 had to offer|_|05 . now it it polluted|_|01 with mining|_|02 waste|_|05 because of the rupture|_|03 of the dam|_|01 . i feel|_|05 really|_|01 bad|_|09 that they are in a position|_|01 where they ca|_|01 nt|_|01 even|_|03 eat|_|06 the fish|_|02 in the river|_|01 because the fish|_|02 showed|_|10 some kind|_|01 of mutation|_|03 because of the pollution|_|03 . it really|_|01 sucks|_|04 that a company|_|03 just pays|_|05 a minimal|_|01 amount|_|02 after causing|_|02 a huge|_|01 disaster|_|03 like|_|02 this totally|_|01 unfair|_|01
jeez , who would have thought|_|05 that those little|_|02 guys|_|03 could wreak|_|03 such environmental|_|02 disaster|_|03 . but this is a classic|_|05 example|_|04 of people|_|01 who think|_|05 their one|_|06 indiscretion|_|02 ( dumping|_|06 the fish|_|02 in the river|_|01 ) is harmless|_|01 . much|_|01 like|_|02 someone|_|01 who starts|_|08 a forest|_|02 fire|_|05 , we should have laws|_|06 making|_|03 the person|_|01 responsible|_|01 liable|_|04 for the cost|_|01 of cleaning|_|01 up the mess|_|02 . not that we 'd ever|_|03 catch|_|20 them .
an agency|_|04 that i ca|_|01 n't recall|_|01 the full|_|03 title|_|06 of just released|_|08 proof|_|01 of the fact|_|03 that the earth|_|01 is getting|_|01 warmer|_|01 . yeah|_|01 , it was only a couple|_|05 of degrees|_|07 but that 's how it starts|_|08 , right|_|01 ? something is causing|_|02 the world|_|08 , the united|_|01 states|_|02 in particular|_|04 , to warm|_|01 up . i know|_|05 where i live|_|01 that it 's seems|_|04 a lot|_|05 warm|_|10 than it was even|_|01 7|_|01 or 8|_|01 years|_|03 ago|_|01 . the seasons|_|02 used|_|01 to be predictable|_|01 , but they do n't seem|_|04 to be that way|_|11 anymore|_|01 .
i do n't believe|_|01 this at all . i think|_|03 people|_|03 are overreacting|_|01 to the news|_|01 that trump|_|02 was elected|_|02 president|_|02 . there are always|_|04 bad|_|01 apples|_|02 out there , no matter|_|02 who the president|_|02 is . to blame|_|02 this on the president|_|02 , right|_|01 after he was even|_|01 elected|_|02 , is wrong|_|05 . give|_|01 the guy|_|03 a chance|_|01 and get|_|02 over it and try|_|01 to make|_|02 something positive|_|01 of this .
so i just read|_|06 an article|_|04 about climate|_|02 change|_|06 , and it is awful|_|01 . it seems|_|02 very few people|_|03 are trying|_|01 to stop|_|05 it and it is maddening|_|01 . we need|_|01 to take|_|03 more control|_|09 over the things|_|08 that are being put|_|02 into the air|_|01 that could be causing|_|02 such an atrocious|_|02 thing|_|08 . we need|_|01 to start|_|10 reusing|_|02 things|_|08 and switching|_|04 to organically|_|03 grown|_|01 things|_|08 , if possible|_|01 . the oceans|_|02 and lakes|_|03 are suffering|_|03 and eventually|_|01 , we will , too .
" here 's one|_|02 more great|_|02 reason|_|02 to never|_|02 allow|_|06 sharia|_|01 law|_|01 into the us|_|01 in any way|_|01 , shape|_|04 , or form|_|02 . this is commonplace|_|01 in the arab|_|02 world|_|01 , where women|_|02 are treated|_|03 essentially|_|01 as slaves|_|03 or worse|_|01 , while men|_|01 can do anything they want|_|05 and get|_|01 away|_|02 with it . what a terrible|_|01 sense|_|02 of " " justice|_|01 " " or " " law|_|01 " " . this poor|_|01 women|_|02 would 've , at best|_|02 , been scarred|_|01 for the rest|_|01 of her life|_|01 just on the grounds|_|04 of being raped|_|07 by multiple|_|01 men|_|01 . i can only imagine|_|02 how traumatic|_|02 this is for her when she 's thrown|_|12 in jail|_|01 after being the victim|_|02 of a horrible|_|03 crime|_|02 ! disgusting|_|02 !

the situation|_|03 in yemen|_|01 with the saudi|_|01 - led|_|03 coalition|_|02 against the outhit rebels|_|01 is one|_|06 with a lot|_|07 of controversy|_|01 , and for good|_|13 reason|_|03 . this conflict|_|01 is rife|_|01 with airstrikes and drone|_|01 strikes|_|05 that drop|_|02 on civilians|_|01 and militants|_|01 alike|_|02 . qatar|_|02 is culpable|_|01 in the slaughter|_|01 of citizens|_|01 , which puts|_|07 them firmly|_|01 against the geneva|_|02 conventions|_|03 . of course|_|07 , i do not celebrate|_|02 the loss|_|05 of their soldiers|_|01 ' lives|_|11 , as their families|_|01 back|_|06 home|_|01 are just regular|_|01 citizens|_|01 as well|_|01 in all likelihood|_|01 .
these poor|_|06 people|_|01 ! it seems|_|04 like|_|02 they really|_|01 ca|_|01 n't catch|_|24 a break|_|01 . like|_|02 it is n't bad|_|09 enough|_|01 that they are already|_|01 trying|_|01 to dig|_|02 themselves out of their tough|_|11 economic|_|05 situation|_|03 and losing|_|11 their homes|_|09 , but now they also|_|02 have to worry|_|06 about a population|_|01 decrease|_|04 . it 's pretty|_|02 clear|_|03 that we need|_|02 more aid|_|02 and more help|_|02 for these people|_|01 in the area|_|01 .
" the only solution|_|04 for the " " wage|_|01 gap|_|13 " " is the total|_|01 establishment|_|02 of capitalism|_|01 and all governments|_|01 . there will be no more wage|_|01 gap|_|13 when there is no money|_|03 ! by instituting|_|02 anarchy|_|01 - communism|_|02 , all people|_|03 can be given|_|03 what they need|_|03 without a worry|_|02 of who is getting|_|02 more or less|_|02 . capitalism|_|01 is evil|_|01 and must|_|01 be destroyed|_|02 ! "
dear|_|04 friend|_|01 , i just read|_|06 a ridiculously|_|01 vapid|_|02 article|_|04 about kim guardianship|_|05 and her posting|_|01 photos|_|01 of her jewelry|_|01 on instagram . she was nearly|_|03 mugged|_|01 last|_|09 year|_|03 and the article|_|04 is explaining|_|02 how its a bad|_|01 idea|_|06 for her to show|_|10 off her expensive|_|01 diamonds|_|01 online|_|03 . i think|_|10 this story|_|02 is silly|_|03 and weightless|_|01 and i font|_|01 really|_|01 see|_|02 how anyone could care|_|02 about it .
" i never|_|01 read|_|03 up much|_|01 on thailand|_|01 , but it seems|_|02 as if the place|_|04 might|_|01 change|_|02 a lot|_|05 in the near|_|01 future|_|03 . the king|_|02 died|_|11 , and the queen|_|03 is dying|_|11 . there is some shady|_|04 general|_|01 who is taking|_|35 over now . the people|_|01 of thailand|_|01 , loved|_|01 their king|_|02 , and he gave|_|01 them a sense|_|02 of stability|_|01 , in a crazy|_|05 political|_|03 climate|_|02 . they mourned|_|02 the former|_|03 king|_|02 for a month|_|02 , and now the queens|_|03 death|_|01 , may|_|01 follow|_|02 very soon|_|01 . i am glad|_|01 , though|_|01 i never|_|01 think|_|13 about it , how lucky|_|01 i am to be in a country|_|04 with some " " sense|_|02 " " of stability|_|01 , and not ruled|_|02 in constant|_|02 flux|_|01 .

i read|_|06 an article|_|03 about this man|_|02 who contracted|_|04 a flesh|_|01 - eating|_|06 bacteria|_|01 and almost|_|07 died|_|03 from it , unfortunately|_|01 it did n't tell|_|02 me where or how he contracted|_|04 the flesh|_|01 eating|_|06 bacteria|_|01 . i 'm not sure|_|08 i would know|_|01 in time|_|02 that i had a flesh|_|01 eating|_|06 bacteria|_|01 , scary|_|01 right|_|01 ! ? ! have you ever|_|01 known|_|01 anyone or heard|_|02 of anyone contracting|_|04 a flesh|_|01 eating|_|06 bacteria|_|01 ?
this is another|_|01 example|_|01 of the racism|_|02 in this country|_|04 , the officers|_|01 again use|_|06 extreme|_|02 deadly|_|03 force|_|01 against a black|_|05 person|_|01 , just because he was black|_|05 , he was not a threat|_|03 and yet|_|03 they shot|_|18 him without hesitation|_|02 . we feel|_|11 more insecure|_|04 with officers|_|01 around|_|04 than safe|_|03 , and still|_|03 they can kill|_|01 people|_|01 and get|_|01 away|_|02 with it .
wow|_|02 … yet|_|01 another|_|01 angle|_|01 from which to look|_|02 at climate|_|02 change|_|03 . and of course|_|04 , it ’s threatening|_|03 and not pretty|_|01 . but it ’s also|_|02 really|_|01 interesting|_|03 to see|_|02 how all the stakeholders|_|01 in a big|_|01 industry|_|02 like|_|02 coffee|_|01 are aware|_|01 of climate|_|02 change|_|03 and its dangers|_|02 , have been for a while , and are actively|_|01 working|_|01 at trying|_|01 to minimize|_|01 its impact|_|01 on their business|_|01 . and yet|_|01 , others have their heads|_|02 firmly|_|01 buried|_|05 in the sand|_|02 and pretend|_|42 nothing|_|01 ’s happening|_|04 .
hey i just saw|_|01 this post|_|05 and this is so sad|_|02 that the kids|_|02 in venezuela|_|01 do not have enough|_|01 to eat|_|02 can you believe|_|01 that some kids|_|02 only eat|_|02 a smell|_|02 meal|_|01 for one|_|01 whole|_|01 day|_|01 instead|_|01 of three|_|02 full|_|01 course|_|07 meals|_|01 i can not even|_|04 believe|_|01 that what is happening|_|02 o the world|_|01 where we raw|_|03 more concerned|_|01 about putting|_|01 money|_|03 into guns|_|02 and creating|_|03 ar|_|01 when we have bigger|_|01 issue|_|01 son|_|02 our hands|_|07 such as ch hunger|_|02 that these people|_|01 are suffering|_|02 and there kids|_|02 so many|_|01 kids|_|02 are suffering|_|02 and even|_|04 fainting|_|01
this article|_|02 is so sad|_|02 the hatred|_|01 and anger|_|02 we have towards one|_|05 another|_|01 in america|_|01 needs|_|02 to stop|_|03 . our children|_|03 and grandchildren|_|01 are going|_|03 to grow|_|01 up in a horrid|_|01 place|_|01 simply|_|01 because we have people|_|01 in our country|_|04 who refuse|_|06 to let|_|03 go|_|03 of the past|_|02 . the past|_|02 is in the past|_|02 so let|_|03 it stay|_|04 in the past|_|02 for crying|_|02 out loud|_|01 .
kkk|_|01 is filled|_|01 with losers|_|03 . not sure|_|08 why they get|_|02 any attention|_|03 . actually|_|02 , i know|_|01 exactly|_|03 why they get|_|02 attention|_|03 . it makes|_|02 trump|_|01 look|_|02 bad|_|01 . since that is the goal|_|04 of the media|_|02 , they will not pass|_|01 this chance|_|01 up . kkk|_|01 has been irrelevant|_|01 for decades|_|01 . this is still|_|03 the case|_|01 . media|_|02 can make|_|02 them look|_|02 relevant|_|01 , but they are not .
this story|_|03 left|_|06 me feeling|_|05 pretty|_|01 confused|_|03 . it was so short|_|01 and did n't provide|_|06 a lot|_|05 of answers|_|02 at all . i was left|_|06 wondering|_|01 why france|_|02 wanted|_|01 to dismantle|_|11 the camp|_|01 and why the refugees|_|01 were so angry|_|01 and against the move|_|01 . what was really|_|01 going|_|03 on here ? were there some other issues|_|04 that had nothing|_|01 to do with humanitarian|_|02 considerations|_|04 ? it seems|_|02 like|_|01 there 's usually|_|01 more to the story|_|03 with refugee|_|01 stories|_|03 .
this is a perfect|_|03 example|_|01 of why we need|_|02 cameras|_|01 everywhere|_|01 . they have this guy|_|03 on video|_|01 doing all the bad|_|01 things|_|05 he would do . there is no way|_|01 anyone can make|_|08 any excuses|_|03 for him now . they will surely|_|01 try|_|01 , though|_|01 . bl will probably|_|01 come|_|04 up with some story|_|03 about how he was an upstanding|_|01 citizen|_|01 or something we have already|_|01 heard|_|02 before .
i feel|_|05 like|_|02 a similar|_|01 scenario|_|03 happens|_|03 at least|_|01 once a year|_|03 in hollywood|_|02 . when i hear|_|04 about stories|_|03 that happen|_|03 in hollywood|_|02 , the lifestyles|_|01 are so different|_|01 than mine|_|02 that it 's almost|_|07 like|_|02 it 's not real|_|03 , like|_|02 it 's a movie|_|01 . people|_|01 in hollywood|_|02 always|_|04 have something to complain|_|02 about so it 's hard|_|01 to feel|_|05 sympathy|_|03 for them , even|_|01 when something like|_|02 this happens|_|03 .
so i just read|_|06 this article|_|04 on gold|_|05 fish|_|02 in the wild|_|03 . wow|_|02 . i learned|_|04 a lot|_|07 . apparently|_|01 we have an overload|_|02 of gold|_|01 fish|_|02 in our lakes|_|01 and rivers|_|01 , which is very bad|_|10 for the fish|_|02 and the earth|_|04 . it 's bad|_|10 for the earth|_|04 because it messes|_|02 with the sediments|_|01 as they swim|_|01 low|_|04 on the bottom|_|01 . it is also|_|02 bad|_|10 for the fish|_|02 because they are n't bread|_|01 for the big|_|02 waters|_|01 . their bodies|_|01 grow|_|08 as big|_|02 as a football|_|02 and they can weigh|_|05 up to 4|_|01 pounds|_|01 . some are not even|_|03 healthy|_|01 . they say|_|01 the best|_|01 way|_|11 to get|_|01 rid|_|01 of healthy|_|01 fish|_|02 is to bring|_|04 it back|_|04 to the pet|_|01 store|_|02 and to not flush|_|02 sick|_|01 or dead|_|16 fish|_|02 . put|_|04 them in an ice|_|02 slush|_|01 . this article|_|04 was really|_|01 sad|_|02 and disturbing|_|11 to read|_|06 at the same time|_|06 .
can you believe|_|01 how disturbed|_|01 some people|_|01 are ? i just read|_|06 an article|_|04 about a woman|_|02 whose parents|_|01 forced|_|06 her to have sex|_|01 with both of them when she was 11|_|01 . they did it for money|_|03 . if you are a parent|_|01 struggling|_|03 for money|_|03 , how in the world|_|08 does your mind|_|07 turn|_|01 to sexually|_|02 abusing|_|03 your child|_|01 for money|_|03 ? they are sick|_|01 , and 20|_|01 years|_|03 is not enough|_|02 time|_|01 for them in prison|_|02 . they are the people|_|01 that are supposed|_|02 to protect|_|02 her , and they violated|_|01 her in the worst|_|01 way|_|02 . she is very brave|_|03 for telling|_|03 her story|_|01 and for just being a survivor|_|03 .
i feel|_|05 like|_|02 entrepreneurship is the future|_|03 . apparently|_|01 they are making|_|08 it so you can quit|_|01 your job|_|01 and get|_|02 unemployment|_|01 benefits|_|03 . it 's pretty|_|02 awesome|_|02 . i guess|_|01 they want|_|01 to encourage|_|03 people|_|01 to start|_|10 unique|_|04 businesses|_|01 on their own in an effort|_|02 to diversify|_|01 the workforce|_|01 in the country|_|04 . pretty|_|01 cool|_|06 if you ask|_|01 me .
i am so tired|_|01 of war|_|04 . especially|_|01 when all it ends|_|03 in death|_|04 , murder|_|01 , rape|_|02 , etc . what is the point|_|23 of all that . who benefits|_|03 from it ? it just makes|_|17 me sad|_|02 for all those people|_|01 . it sure|_|04 does make|_|17 me grateful|_|02 to live|_|02 in a country|_|02 where i do not have to deal|_|01 with all that . could you imagine|_|02 waking|_|04 up every|_|02 day|_|05 not knowing|_|05 if you 're going|_|01 to die|_|02 or blow|_|01 up from a bomb|_|05 ?
it ’s a shame|_|02 that nevada|_|01 is going|_|03 through this . it is a beautiful|_|02 state|_|02 . i really|_|01 feel|_|04 for the reservations|_|07 . they have no where to go|_|03 . they rely|_|01 on water|_|06 as a way|_|05 of life|_|13 . they have animals|_|01 that need|_|03 water|_|06 . i do n’t really|_|01 know|_|05 what can be done . maybe|_|01 we should address|_|05 climate|_|02 change|_|01 . it is definitely|_|01 happening|_|04 .
you have to read|_|05 this . it 's unbelievable|_|01 that people|_|01 could act|_|03 so rash|_|01 and wrong|_|05 towards another|_|01 human|_|03 being , no matter|_|02 what happened|_|04 . if i were in that situation|_|03 , i 'd be so angry|_|03 and i would want|_|05 to hurt|_|06 someone|_|01 back|_|06 . it 's hard|_|08 not to get|_|19 caught|_|19 up in the emotion|_|01 of the situation|_|03 since so many|_|01 people|_|01 got|_|19 hurt|_|06 .
i know|_|10 that the affordable|_|01 care|_|02 act|_|02 will effect|_|01 a lot|_|05 of people|_|01 out there who are already|_|01 struggling|_|02 but this is an issue|_|01 that just sounds|_|02 wrong|_|05 to me . first|_|02 because so many|_|01 women|_|02 that i know|_|10 who have gotten|_|01 and iud|_|01 had complications|_|04 and second|_|01 because the issue|_|01 of women|_|02 being able|_|01 to choose|_|03 to have an abortion|_|01 is a bitter|_|05 conversation|_|01 to me .
i just read|_|01 an article|_|02 regarding|_|05 a severe|_|06 problem|_|01 in the chicago|_|03 area|_|06 with the fact|_|03 that their public|_|02 water|_|02 supply|_|01 has high|_|01 amounts|_|02 of lead|_|11 traces|_|02 . just what i need|_|02 , another|_|01 worldly|_|01 problem|_|01 to stress|_|07 about ? ! article|_|02 shook|_|09 me , as the health|_|02 of not only myself but my children|_|03 is of the utmost|_|07 importance|_|02 to me . i know|_|03 , i do n’t live|_|01 in the chicago|_|03 area|_|06 , but the article|_|02 certainly|_|01 made|_|18 me think|_|03 about the water|_|02 that i drink|_|01 every|_|02 day|_|04 , and my children|_|03 drink|_|01 and then just threw|_|02 foods|_|01 that i have cooked|_|02 and prepared|_|12 . even|_|03 my local|_|01 town|_|01 has just posted|_|07 something on the fact|_|03 that they need|_|02 $ 3.2 million|_|01 to repair|_|02 the water|_|02 mains|_|02 in the one|_|05 square|_|01 - mile|_|02 town|_|01 as the water|_|02 pipes|_|02 are corroded|_|02 and near|_|03 health|_|02 hazard|_|02 . i will be researching|_|02 this locally|_|02 . i will also|_|02 be researching|_|02 for more info|_|01 on the subject|_|05
i just read|_|06 an article|_|04 about u.s.|_|01 soldiers|_|02 being killed|_|07 in jordan|_|02 . this is tearing|_|03 my heart|_|01 out and i ca|_|01 n't get|_|01 the images|_|03 of what must|_|01 have happened|_|01 out of my mind|_|01 . you know|_|07 that i was in the military|_|02 myself and it makes|_|03 it that much|_|01 harder|_|11 on me . i ca|_|01 n't begin|_|07 to imagine|_|02 how the families|_|01 of these soldiers|_|02 must|_|01 feel|_|04 . from what i read|_|06 , apparently|_|01 this was an accident|_|02 and the soldiers|_|02 were shot|_|03 when they failed|_|04 to stop|_|18 at the checkpoint|_|01 going|_|01 into the base|_|03 . the base|_|03 was already|_|01 on alert|_|02 due|_|02 to a previous|_|03 car|_|01 bomb|_|05 attack|_|01 . i 'm guessing|_|02 that they felt|_|01 they could n't take|_|06 any chances|_|01 on it being another|_|01 car|_|01 bomber|_|01 and went|_|01 ahead|_|01 and shot|_|01 at the vehicle|_|01 . it 's so sad|_|02 . it 's bad|_|01 enough|_|01 that these brave|_|01 men|_|01 have to face|_|01 dangers|_|02 from the enemy|_|02 , but when they get|_|01 taken|_|06 down by friendly|_|04 fire|_|02 ?
hello|_|01 friend|_|01 , how have you been lately|_|01 ? , i have some curiosity|_|01 about an article|_|04 that i read|_|09 recently|_|01 , that helped|_|05 me a lot|_|05 , that i realized|_|08 that the article|_|04 had a problem|_|01 that interested|_|01 me more , because of the events|_|01 that were happening|_|02 in this , for example|_|04 : that a study|_|04 published|_|03 online|_|03 through the journal|_|02 current|_|02 biology|_|01 revealed|_|02 that in the period|_|01 of 25|_|01 years|_|03 , half|_|01 the size|_|04 of the amazon|_|04 , and twice|_|01 the size|_|04 of the state|_|02 of alaska|_|01 , has been exhausted|_|05 .
an article|_|04 that i just read|_|03 is really|_|01 pretty|_|02 disturbing|_|11 . it speaks|_|02 of the tremendous|_|02 droughts|_|02 in the river|_|01 areas|_|03 of bolivia|_|02 . it 's bad|_|09 enough|_|01 because it is just a natural|_|06 disaster|_|03 situation|_|01 , but the fact|_|03 that there was also|_|02 mismanagement|_|01 involved|_|07 is particularly|_|01 troubling|_|01 . the government|_|02 failed|_|11 to properly|_|01 care|_|02 for the canals|_|01 . the article|_|04 also|_|02 speaks|_|02 of selling|_|05 off many|_|01 of its wild|_|02 animals|_|01 . this might|_|01 become|_|01 a very serious|_|01 problem|_|01 given|_|03 the fact|_|03 that some of the animals|_|01 are endangered|_|02 species|_|01 such as the wild|_|02 dog|_|01 . they are also|_|02 looking|_|02 at selling|_|05 off elephants|_|02 , lions|_|02 and pythons|_|03 . even|_|03 if they do this , how much|_|01 of the money|_|03 will ever|_|01 actually|_|01 reach|_|03 its citizens|_|01 to help|_|01 them ?
from this article|_|04 i learned|_|04 about repression|_|03 of gay|_|01 rights|_|01 in uganda|_|01 . gay|_|01 rights|_|01 protesters|_|01 were rounded|_|03 up by police|_|01 and taken|_|04 away|_|02 from the resort|_|02 where they were protesting|_|03 and of those that attempted|_|01 to resume|_|01 protesting|_|03 at another|_|01 spot|_|08 , police|_|01 escorted|_|22 them away|_|02 . gay|_|01 rights|_|01 have been struggling|_|03 in uganda|_|01 , where homosexuality|_|01 is illegal|_|01 and repressed|_|01 .
dude|_|06 , you wo n't believe|_|01 this . a six|_|01 - year|_|01 - old|_|03 girl|_|05 fell|_|08 down an elevator|_|01 shaft|_|09 and died|_|01 . the elevator|_|01 company|_|01 has to be at fault|_|01 here , but that wo n't bring|_|04 her back|_|04 ! i ca|_|01 n't imagine|_|02 how her parents|_|01 must|_|01 feel|_|05 , looking|_|01 at my little|_|03 boy|_|02 and wondering|_|03 what it would be like|_|02 if we lost|_|07 him in such a horrible|_|03 -- yet|_|01 preventable|_|01 -- tragedy|_|02 . i feel|_|05 so bad|_|01 for the parents|_|01 , but i wonder|_|03 if they could have prevented|_|02 it somehow|_|02 , and if so , it would be hard|_|05 not to blame|_|02 them somewhat|_|01 for what happened|_|04 . but that is n't to deflect|_|02 guilt|_|02 over how horrible|_|03 they must|_|01 feel|_|05 , as no one|_|02 wants|_|01 to lose|_|07 their child|_|02 in such an egregious|_|02 tragedy|_|02 . i hope|_|02 you pray|_|01 for the family|_|02 with me !
hello|_|01 brother|_|01 i am learning|_|01 the news|_|04 i am very happy|_|04 that you are already|_|01 in sacrament|_|01 i am happy|_|04 that after completing|_|04 your dream|_|01 of playing|_|20 in the nba is a great|_|01 time|_|03 for you and you should know|_|01 how to take|_|35 advantage|_|03 of this great|_|01 opportunity|_|01 take|_|35 care|_|02 of yourself and succeed|_|02 . i'm really|_|01 very proud|_|03 of you
this story|_|01 is just sad|_|02 and i just feel|_|05 like|_|04 there should be something that we can do to prevent|_|02 killings|_|02 of wild|_|04 animals|_|01 just because they own the earth|_|01 as well|_|01 as we do . just because humans|_|02 are expanding|_|01 and advancing|_|08 in technology|_|01 it does not mean|_|05 that we kill|_|01 and we hunt|_|01 everything that we see|_|10 . it is heartbreaking|_|02 .
i think|_|10 china|_|01 has a real|_|01 problem|_|01 with safety|_|02 standards|_|06 and that 's why they have so many|_|01 accidents|_|02 in their various|_|02 industries|_|01 . it 's really|_|01 sad|_|02 that they place|_|01 economic|_|01 growth|_|01 over human|_|03 lives|_|02 . if they did implement|_|02 safety|_|02 standards|_|06 , they would n't lose|_|11 so many|_|01 lives|_|02 or potential|_|01 workers|_|03 and people|_|01 that care|_|02 for children|_|02 .
the results|_|02 of the fire|_|03 could have been worse|_|01 . i 'm just glad|_|03 nobody|_|04 died|_|01 . stuff|_|07 can always|_|04 be replaced|_|01 . burns|_|01 are the worst|_|01 since they 're so painful|_|02 . hopefully|_|02 these people|_|03 have some family|_|08 they can stay|_|04 with until they 're able|_|01 to find|_|01 a new|_|12 housing|_|01 situation|_|02 . that 's great|_|03 that the firemen|_|02 were able|_|01 to get|_|01 the fire|_|03 under control|_|06 so quickly|_|01 .
" to be honest|_|02 with you , in my opinion|_|01 , i do not believe|_|01 russia|_|01 or syria|_|01 are peaceful|_|01 countries|_|04 . syria|_|01 has the most corrupt|_|01 and dishonest|_|01 government|_|02 officials|_|02 in the world|_|08 , and the fact|_|03 that russia|_|01 has defended|_|08 them through everything is very disturbing|_|11 and alarming|_|02 . i know|_|01 we all like|_|02 to think|_|10 that trump|_|02 and putin|_|01 are in " " bed|_|01 " " together|_|03 , but is that really|_|01 the case|_|19 ? what syria|_|01 does to its own people|_|01 goes|_|03 beyond|_|03 what words|_|04 can describe|_|01 , and how russia|_|01 can defend|_|08 these actions|_|01 is almost|_|07 as equally|_|01 disgusting|_|02 . "
" my amazement|_|01 with the acts|_|02 of random|_|01 humans|_|02 never|_|01 ceases|_|01 . i often|_|05 question|_|02 how it is that i , another|_|01 random|_|01 human|_|02 in this mixed|_|02 up shit|_|01 - hole|_|02 we call|_|02 " " planet|_|02 earth|_|01 " " , can have unlimited|_|01 empathy|_|01 ( to the level|_|02 that i wo n't even|_|01 squash|_|01 a bug|_|01 ) and other people|_|01 will go|_|03 out of their way|_|06 to run|_|11 over an animal|_|01 crossing|_|01 the road|_|02 . humans|_|02 can be rather|_|01 sadistic|_|01 and disgusting|_|02 individuals|_|01 . every|_|02 single|_|01 day|_|05 of my life|_|08 i hear|_|04 of some crazy|_|03 story|_|02 about someone|_|01 beating|_|01 something to death|_|04 . "
this is just more violent|_|01 nonsense|_|01 from the outrageous|_|01 middle|_|04 east|_|05 . honestly|_|02 , i font|_|01 care|_|02 any longer|_|01 . all these people|_|03 clutching|_|01 to one|_|05 religion|_|02 or another|_|01 ( often|_|03 just as a mask|_|01 for their rage|_|04 ) and killing|_|01 each other out of tribal|_|01 animus|_|01 . it hast changed|_|06 , well|_|13 , ever|_|03 . i font|_|01 expect|_|01 it to change|_|06 now . its hopeless|_|04 because people|_|03 are just ignorant|_|03 , solipsistic apes|_|01 . i just ca|_|01 nt|_|01 care|_|02 any longer|_|01 about these idiots|_|01 . its horrible|_|03 and tragic|_|01 but it 's all so preventable|_|01 .
food|_|02 , water|_|06 fears|_|03 remain|_|04 year|_|03 after brazil|_|01 mine|_|02 dam|_|01 disaster|_|01 — collation|_|03 , brazil|_|01 — one|_|05 year|_|03 after a dam|_|01 ruptured|_|01 and sent|_|02 a giant|_|01 wave|_|01 of metal|_|01 - laden|_|01 mud|_|01 gushing|_|01 into one|_|05 of brazil|_|01 ’s most important|_|01 rivers|_|01 , people|_|01 who live|_|02 along|_|03 the banks|_|01 wo n’t drink|_|02 the water|_|06 and fishermen|_|01 are afraid|_|02 to eat|_|01 their catch|_|05 . upward|_|04 of 10|_|01 billion|_|01 gallons|_|02 of mud|_|01 filled|_|04 with mining|_|02 waste|_|01 buried|_|03 towns|_|02 in the nov. 5|_|01 dam|_|01 break|_|02 that has been described|_|02 as the worst|_|01 environmental|_|02 disaster|_|01 in latin|_|03 america|_|02 ’s largest|_|01 country|_|04 . nineteen|_|01 people|_|01 perished|_|01 . across|_|02 5,000 acres|_|03 — about six|_|01 times|_|03 the size|_|05 of new|_|05 york|_|01 city|_|03 ’s central|_|01 park|_|01 — the onslaught|_|01 of mud|_|01 crushed|_|01 thousands|_|01 of trees|_|01 and wildlife|_|01 . in the river|_|01 , more than 14|_|01 tons|_|01 of fish|_|01 died|_|04 , mostly|_|01 after mud|_|01 got|_|01 stuck|_|05 in their gills|_|04 . an equally|_|01 large|_|01 amount|_|02 of aquatic|_|02 plants|_|02 die|_|04
it never|_|02 ceases|_|01 to amaze|_|01 me that things|_|01 like|_|02 this as still|_|01 occurring|_|03 . they want|_|02 to roll|_|03 back|_|04 regulations|_|01 when things|_|01 like|_|02 this happened|_|02 because there were none|_|02 and now kids|_|02 have to pay|_|10 the price|_|02 , but they are kids|_|02 of color|_|01 so they font|_|01 matter|_|01 . remember|_|07 this , flint|_|03 still|_|01 does not have clean|_|03 water|_|01 years|_|03 later|_|01 . the government|_|02 is corrupt|_|01 and the cancer|_|05 starts|_|06 in the oval|_|01 office|_|04 and runs|_|03 through his|_|01 swamp|_|02 . its time|_|06 to get|_|01 these people|_|03 out of office|_|04 and to punish|_|01 the companies|_|03 and people|_|03 that have allowed|_|01 this to happened|_|02 to the innocent|_|07 children|_|03 of america|_|01 . we need|_|02 more regulations|_|01 not less|_|02 .
there has been unrest|_|02 over the disputed|_|01 region|_|03 of kashmir|_|01 between pakistan|_|01 and india|_|01 . it looks|_|02 as though|_|01 there were 13|_|01 civilians|_|01 killed|_|01 during this latest|_|04 skirmish|_|06 . it 's pathetic|_|03 to see|_|02 so many|_|01 innocent|_|07 people|_|01 being killed|_|01 for no reason|_|02 over this disputed|_|01 land|_|04 . already|_|01 there have been two|_|01 wars|_|01 fought|_|06 between these two|_|01 countries|_|04 . i hope|_|03 they can reach|_|03 a peaceful|_|01 settlement|_|01 but since this has been ongoing|_|01 for over 70|_|01 years|_|03 i highly|_|03 doubt|_|02 that this will actually|_|04 happen|_|04 .
" it was sort|_|01 of sadly|_|01 ironic|_|02 to see|_|05 the part|_|10 in there about " " we do n't think|_|01 he 'll win|_|05 " " considering|_|05 what followed|_|02 . all of it , sadly|_|01 , still|_|01 rings|_|03 true|_|12 , day|_|01 after day|_|01 . there 's been no apology|_|01 , only a doubling|_|01 down on the kind|_|01 of bile|_|01 , arrogance|_|01 , and ignorance|_|01 that was on display|_|06 since day|_|01 one|_|05 . i feel|_|05 bad|_|01 for every|_|01 woman|_|01 in the country|_|04 who has to live|_|05 with someone|_|01 like|_|04 that as their president|_|01 . "
officers|_|01 shooting|_|01 at unarmed|_|01 black|_|12 men|_|01 needs|_|02 to stop|_|05 . i know|_|01 there are some really|_|01 good|_|01 cops|_|05 out there , but the bad|_|01 ones|_|01 are the ones|_|01 giving|_|43 the good|_|01 ones|_|01 a bad|_|01 rep|_|02 . more officers|_|01 should be vetted|_|02 before they go|_|04 to the academy|_|04 . they need|_|02 to have better|_|01 background|_|04 checks|_|02 . i completely|_|01 understand|_|01 if someone|_|01 was armed|_|02 and the officers|_|01 were in fear|_|03 of their safety|_|06 for them to shoot|_|01 , but if a white|_|07 officer|_|01 shoots|_|02 at an unarmed|_|01 black|_|12 man|_|01 for no reason|_|03 , that 's wrong|_|01 .
it 's absolutely|_|02 horrible|_|03 how indian|_|01 government|_|02 treats|_|02 their people|_|01 ! poverty|_|01 , disease|_|01 , no regulations|_|05 when it comes|_|04 to the environmental|_|02 safety|_|01 standards|_|02 . my heart|_|01 goes|_|01 out to these people|_|01 because they deserve|_|01 to live|_|01 in peace|_|05 on this earth|_|01 and be healthy|_|03 and prosperous|_|05 just like|_|02 everyone else|_|03 . such a blatant|_|01 disregard|_|02 for human|_|03 life|_|01 ! india|_|01 is like|_|02 hell|_|02 in earth|_|01 . i would lock|_|09 up these government|_|02 people|_|01 in solitary|_|01 confinement|_|03 for life|_|01 and let|_|01 the fly|_|05 ash|_|01 befall|_|01 on their heads|_|01 so they can find|_|01 out what getting|_|02 tuberculosis|_|01 and liver|_|04 decease|_|01 is like|_|02 for these poor|_|03 people|_|01 ! the situation|_|01 in india|_|01 just never|_|02 ends|_|01 , makes|_|02 you wonder|_|02 where all these mega wealthy|_|01 indian|_|01 royals|_|02 are ? ! ! ! why is n't the fly|_|01 ash|_|03 falling|_|31 on them , or why are n't they drinking|_|02 polluted|_|01 water|_|01 that causes|_|02 lung|_|01 illness|_|01 ! ! !
" in my opinion|_|01 , the girl|_|02 mentioned|_|01 in the article|_|04 is just plain|_|01 stupid|_|01 . she should n't be taking|_|02 selfless|_|01 in the first|_|05 place|_|01 while driving|_|16 , not only to mention|_|01 that she was topless|_|01 just so her boyfriend|_|01 could get|_|14 a look|_|03 at " " the goods|_|01 . " " while you 're driving|_|16 , you should be paying|_|05 attention|_|01 and not playing|_|02 on your cell|_|06 phone|_|01 because you 're putting|_|02 the lives|_|02 of others at risk|_|04 . "
this is sad|_|02 on the surface|_|04 , that these two|_|01 passed|_|01 away|_|06 while scuba|_|01 diving|_|03 at such an old|_|01 age|_|01 , but then i consider|_|01 it . these two|_|01 people|_|01 - lived|_|01 their life|_|05 together|_|04 - went|_|03 somewhere|_|01 glorious|_|03 and had a wonderful|_|02 time|_|06 on vacation|_|01 together|_|04 before passing|_|01 . it is morbid|_|01 , yes|_|01 , but is it not also|_|02 somewhat|_|01 beautiful|_|01 ?
there is people|_|01 starving|_|01 and going|_|01 without any food|_|02 . some of these people|_|01 used|_|06 to have jobs|_|10 and ate|_|01 well|_|02 before they fell|_|08 on bad|_|09 times|_|04 . they are suffering|_|09 and going|_|01 without basic|_|02 necessities|_|02 . one|_|05 mother|_|01 went|_|01 as far|_|01 as trying|_|01 to boil|_|02 grass|_|01 for her children|_|04 to eat|_|06 . i ca|_|01 nt|_|01 imagine|_|02 lacking|_|06 so much|_|01 nutrition|_|03 and suffering|_|09 so bad|_|09
i kind|_|01 of felt|_|03 a little|_|02 angry|_|03 reading|_|02 this article|_|04 . i felt|_|03 as thought|_|01 this may|_|01 have been something that was preventable|_|01 with better|_|13 infrastructure|_|02 in place|_|01 or procedures|_|03 to check|_|23 water|_|02 supplies|_|02 for such bacteria|_|01 . many|_|01 people|_|01 lost|_|01 their lives|_|08 or ended|_|04 up , maybe|_|01 it was passed|_|01 through their family|_|01 . it would be horrible|_|03 to lose|_|01 someone|_|01 that you care|_|02 about like|_|02 this .
hey i just wanted|_|01 you know|_|05 that i read|_|06 something disturbing|_|11 this morning|_|01 in an article|_|04 . there were bombings|_|02 and people|_|03 were killed|_|01 over fuel|_|01 . this is alarming|_|02 and out of control|_|11 . i 'm feeling|_|05 so many|_|01 emotions|_|01 right|_|01 now . from upset|_|01 to angry|_|01 . i do n't understand|_|01 how people|_|03 can blow|_|01 other people|_|03 up over something so trivial|_|03 and stupid|_|01 . they were just wanting|_|01 fuel|_|01 !
it 's ridiculous|_|03 that those talk|_|01 shows|_|06 of daytime|_|04 tv|_|01 moved|_|02 on to be more like|_|02 soap|_|03 opera|_|03 's . they could have done a lot|_|05 of good|_|01 for their fans|_|01 , but then it just became|_|04 more of a cheap|_|01 laugh|_|02 . the people|_|03 that lost|_|01 their jobs|_|02 on sally|_|01 jesse raphael|_|02 had families|_|01 they supported|_|03 . after being told|_|05 the show|_|06 would be renewed|_|01 , it was a harsh|_|06 blow|_|06 to find|_|05 out that was n't the case|_|01 . i feel|_|05 for those that were put|_|01 out of work|_|02 .
how sick|_|06 is this . a visitor|_|01 at busch gardens|_|03 in florida|_|01 attacked|_|06 a flamingo|_|01 . park|_|01 staff|_|06 had to euthanize the bird|_|01 because of its injuries|_|02 . it seems|_|04 the flamingo|_|01 did some sort|_|04 of unique|_|04 dance|_|01 and had become|_|04 quite|_|04 well|_|10 known|_|07 for it . the guy|_|03 is being held|_|03 on bond|_|01 , charged|_|01 with animal|_|01 cruelty|_|03 . they ought to throw|_|03 the book|_|05 at him .
france|_|01 plans|_|02 to shut|_|02 down the jungle|_|03 as they call|_|02 it . this was where they kept|_|04 illegal|_|01 immigrants|_|01 trying|_|01 to make|_|36 their way|_|06 to britain|_|01 . i certainly|_|01 feel|_|07 for anyone looking|_|02 for a better|_|01 life|_|02 and at times|_|02 wish|_|04 all countries|_|04 had open|_|05 borders|_|03 as this one|_|01 is n't so great|_|01 at times|_|02 but we do have laws|_|01 and many|_|01 immigrants|_|01 enter|_|01 other countries|_|04 legally|_|02 and i think|_|03 there needs|_|01 to be some sort|_|04 of controls|_|02 that make|_|36 the process|_|06 fair|_|03 to legal|_|04 citizens|_|01 . i feel|_|07 for the immigrants|_|01 but it 's hard|_|01 to support|_|04 their actions|_|01 when they could also|_|02 do so legally|_|02 as opposed|_|02 to sneaking|_|01 in by way|_|06 of hiding|_|03 in trucks|_|01 .

i think|_|02 it is crazy|_|03 that these employees|_|01 were put|_|02 through this at well|_|05 's fargo|_|01 . i have never|_|02 worked|_|02 at a bank|_|10 before , but being told|_|01 to reach|_|07 a quota|_|03 , even|_|01 by the means|_|01 of doing illegal|_|01 tasks|_|02 to accomplish|_|01 what they needed|_|01 to do . i ca|_|01 n't imagine|_|02 coming|_|04 into working|_|02 everyday|_|03 and wondering|_|02 if i was going|_|01 to be considered|_|05 a good|_|13 or a bad|_|01 employee|_|01 . it would infuriate|_|01 me to have earned|_|08 a bonus|_|02 and then be told|_|01 i can not have it because i am being developed|_|15 as an employee|_|01 . i am glad|_|01 they decided|_|01 to make|_|07 the change|_|06 . it sounds|_|02 better|_|01 for their employees|_|01 .

i just read|_|09 on a news|_|01 paper|_|01 about a situation|_|01 in the capital|_|04 of bangladesh|_|01 , dhaka|_|01 about their water|_|02 situations|_|01 . they are confronted|_|02 with a very complicated|_|02 water|_|02 problem|_|01 that is quickly|_|01 turning|_|26 extremely|_|01 serious|_|02 . the capital|_|04 city|_|01 has a population|_|04 of 15|_|01 million|_|01 . they are pumping|_|08 the water|_|02 from the city|_|01 from the underground|_|01 and the water|_|02 is dropping|_|01 with 9|_|01 feet|_|01 every|_|02 year|_|03 . my understanding|_|03 is that the water|_|02 is becoming|_|01 less|_|01 potable|_|01 as the pumping|_|02 is going|_|01 deeper|_|01 being contaminated|_|02 with arsenic|_|02 . the researchers|_|01 are trying|_|01 to locate|_|04 the contaminated|_|02 areas|_|06 and in the meantime|_|01 thinking|_|01 of different|_|01 sources|_|02 of water|_|02 such as the one|_|01 with the help|_|02 of monsoon|_|03 . they do have serious|_|02 problems|_|01 over there and sounds|_|02 pretty|_|02 difficult|_|01 to have it fixed|_|02 . many|_|01 will have to suffer|_|03 unfortunately|_|01 in the meantime|_|01
wow|_|02 talk|_|01 about crazy|_|01 . i know|_|05 the situation|_|03 in africa|_|01 was bad|_|01 , but i just always|_|01 feel|_|03 it never|_|02 gets|_|01 better|_|13 . you told|_|02 me that you 're visiting|_|07 in a few weeks|_|01 . can you ensure|_|10 me that you will be okay|_|01 ? i am worried|_|01 about you and want|_|01 to maker|_|01 sure|_|01 you 're okay|_|01 . hopefully|_|01 your missionary|_|01 work|_|02 will yield|_|13 good|_|13 results|_|03 . maybe|_|01 i will read|_|03 about you in an article|_|04 in a few months|_|01 helping|_|01 over all . anyways|_|01 , i hope|_|02 this reaches|_|04 you .
why are there so many|_|01 issues|_|01 between the middle|_|04 eastern|_|02 countries|_|04 and the united|_|01 states|_|04 ? there needs|_|02 to be world|_|01 peace|_|01 and each nation|_|04 should stop|_|01 trying|_|01 to be the powerful|_|01 dog|_|01 here . i wish|_|02 everyone could just get|_|14 along|_|03 and we would n't have to waste|_|10 so much|_|01 time|_|02 with these political|_|03 affairs|_|01 . so many|_|01 people|_|01 lost|_|08 lives|_|01 over nonsense|_|01 .
thinking|_|13 about air|_|08 conditions|_|05 in other countries|_|04 i wonder|_|02 if other countries|_|04 who have the capability|_|01 can help|_|02 out . the article|_|04 i read|_|05 was about air|_|08 quality|_|01 and i wondered|_|02 if it 's hard|_|01 to teach|_|01 indian|_|01 citizens|_|01 the affects|_|01 of what they are doing . maybe|_|01 teaching|_|01 them in school|_|05 would help|_|02 . it seems|_|02 many|_|01 people|_|01 are suffering|_|01 and changing|_|01 for the better|_|18 would benefit|_|02 a lot|_|05 of people|_|01 . i guess|_|02 us|_|01 caring|_|02 about those would also|_|02 be beneficial|_|01 to us|_|01 because we all share|_|02 the same planet|_|02 .
having traveled|_|01 through afghanistan|_|01 in the mid-1970s and having had a son|_|02 deployed|_|02 in afghanistan|_|01 during the us|_|01 incursion|_|01 , i can tell|_|07 you that the country|_|04 is profoundly|_|01 backward|_|04 and disorganized|_|01 even|_|03 at the best|_|01 of times|_|06 . this influx|_|01 of refugees|_|01 will cause|_|02 chaos|_|04 on a massive|_|03 scale|_|10 . the usa|_|01 should help|_|06 . if we are willing|_|01 to invade|_|04 and contribute|_|02 to the destabilization|_|02 of the country|_|04 in our own interests|_|01 , we should also|_|02 be willing|_|01 to come|_|11 in as a magnanimous|_|01 gesture|_|01 and help|_|06 out these poor|_|03 people|_|01 in the time|_|06 of their need|_|01 .
as we all know|_|10 , there has been much|_|01 media|_|02 on police|_|01 brutality|_|01 . there are many|_|01 police|_|01 officers|_|01 that believe|_|05 they are above the law|_|01 , and the common|_|02 citizens|_|01 does n't have any rights|_|08 when they are interacting|_|01 with them . unfortunately|_|01 , it 's very sad|_|02 to say|_|09 , that even|_|01 if a citizen|_|01 is innocent|_|01 , if they do n't cooperate|_|01 to the fullest|_|01 , the police|_|01 can physically|_|01 harm|_|01 them , even|_|01 possibly|_|02 lead|_|03 to being shot|_|02 and killed|_|07 . this is very scary|_|01 ! so , while i do n't believe|_|05 all officers|_|01 are like|_|02 this , one|_|06 is too many|_|01 !
it can be a hard|_|11 experience|_|03 to go|_|04 through , but i feel|_|05 that this was a good|_|17 article|_|04 about the conditions|_|05 of haiti|_|01 . it 's not in a very good|_|17 state|_|04 and has gone|_|04 through some tough|_|04 trials|_|04 . the people|_|01 are in need|_|02 of support|_|06 , supplies|_|02 , resources|_|02 , hope|_|02 , and cooperation|_|02 . the writing|_|08 was very descriptive|_|02 of what has happened|_|01 and may|_|01 come|_|04 in the future|_|03 . i think|_|13 you 'd find|_|05 this interesting|_|05 to read|_|03 .
i read|_|06 an interesting|_|01 article|_|02 online|_|03 about russia|_|01 again . apparently|_|01 one|_|05 of putin|_|01 former|_|01 aids|_|02 had just died|_|10 outside|_|01 of a hotel|_|01 in d.c.|_|01 , that is really|_|01 crazy|_|05 and scary|_|01 . apparently|_|01 a lot|_|05 of people|_|03 are thinking|_|01 that this could be foul|_|04 play|_|01 and it would n't be a surprise|_|03 since the russian|_|01 government|_|02 is known|_|01 for doing this sort|_|02 of thing|_|08 all the time|_|01 . he was apparently|_|01 fixing|_|02 to cut|_|02 a deal|_|06 with the federal|_|04 government|_|02 which would have angered|_|02 the russian|_|01 government|_|02 so i bet|_|08 they killed|_|01 him off so that they could avoid|_|01 him giving|_|20 away|_|02 information|_|05 to the federal|_|04 government|_|02 .
it 's hard|_|01 to believe|_|01 that they would go|_|01 through with this , but they probably|_|01 want|_|01 economic|_|03 growth|_|01 and that will need|_|02 extra|_|01 airport|_|01 runways|_|09 . the residents|_|01 are understandably|_|01 upset|_|02 because they will lose|_|01 their homes|_|01 , but will likely|_|01 be compensated|_|01 . i do think|_|10 that politicians|_|03 that said|_|01 they would vote|_|03 against expansion|_|04 and then change|_|01 their minds|_|01 , should be voted|_|03 out .
i fol this article|_|04 it has a variety|_|01 teaching|_|02 about science|_|02 that banana|_|01 is the world|_|08 's most popular|_|03 fruit|_|01 crop|_|01 , with over 100|_|01 million|_|01 metric|_|01 tons|_|01 produced|_|08 annually|_|01 in over 130|_|01 tropical|_|01 and subtropical|_|01 countries|_|04 in like|_|02 a 1950s|_|01 they used|_|06 to grow|_|08 banana|_|01 this causes|_|02 disease|_|01 gets|_|08 harder|_|01 to control|_|03 over time|_|03 all this is done by professor|_|01 of plant|_|04 pathology|_|01 at the university|_|02 of california|_|01 , davis|_|01
just because someone|_|01 happens|_|04 to be a celebrity|_|01 does n't mean|_|04 that their suffering|_|03 is any less|_|03 valid|_|02 than the average|_|02 person|_|01 's . we should learn|_|01 to recognize|_|02 that as a society|_|03 , we must|_|01 come|_|04 to understand|_|01 the universal|_|02 nature|_|04 of suffering|_|03 as applicable|_|01 to all people|_|01 . one|_|05 's status|_|01 in life|_|08 should not leave|_|12 them any more open|_|03 to suffering|_|03 than others .
i hate|_|01 isis|_|01 . they are a group|_|01 full|_|06 of hate|_|01 and insanity|_|01 . there is no reason|_|03 for them to be doing the things|_|12 they do . they make|_|43 people|_|01 suffer|_|01 and die|_|11 for no reason|_|03 at all . they think|_|03 they are better|_|01 than other people|_|01 and should be disbanded|_|02 . i do not think|_|03 there is room|_|04 in this world|_|08 for people|_|01 that associate|_|01 with them and they are highly|_|01 misguided|_|01 . i can not respect|_|01 them at all .
this story|_|03 makes|_|35 me sick|_|02 to my stomach|_|04 . i hate|_|01 reading|_|03 things|_|01 about where my food|_|01 comes|_|04 from . it 's bad|_|01 enough|_|01 to know|_|01 that i am eating|_|06 an animal|_|01 but to know|_|01 it suffered|_|05 makes|_|35 it worse|_|01 . while the story|_|03 is about the the suffering|_|05 of an animal|_|01 at the end|_|06 of it 's life|_|06 it seems|_|02 to ignore|_|04 the suffering|_|05 that the chicken|_|01 goes|_|03 through 99.9 % of the time|_|04 it is alive|_|01 . this kind|_|01 of story|_|03 makes|_|35 me want|_|05 to go|_|03 vegan|_|01 .
wow|_|02 . i can imagine|_|02 being in that man|_|01 's shoes|_|02 . it sounds|_|04 as if his|_|01 son|_|02 could have been more disturbed|_|01 than originally|_|01 thought|_|05 at the other arrest|_|02 . i would be devastated|_|02 if i felt|_|03 so threatened|_|03 by my own child|_|02 that i had to resort|_|03 to violence|_|03 . i mean|_|01 , how terrible|_|01 it must|_|01 be ! though|_|01 details|_|04 are n't completely|_|01 clear|_|06 , it sounds|_|04 as if the son|_|02 had some issues|_|01 that were n't completely|_|01 dealt|_|02 with and it resulted|_|03 in some sort|_|04 of confrontation|_|02 with his|_|01 dad|_|01 . how terrible|_|01 to have to carry|_|02 this with him the rest|_|04 of forever|_|02 . it would break|_|02 my heart|_|03 in two|_|01 . i hope|_|03 he gets|_|02 deep|_|02 counseling|_|01 for his|_|01 grief|_|02 and guilt|_|02 . perhaps|_|01 if the son|_|02 had , it would n't have happened|_|01 . more 's the pity|_|02 .
so the fbi|_|01 seems|_|02 to fail|_|11 at preventing|_|01 serious|_|02 terrorist|_|01 attacks|_|05 when they knowingly|_|01 had a suspect|_|01 . their investigations|_|01 obviously|_|01 are not thorough|_|01 enough|_|01 to always|_|04 prevent|_|01 attacks|_|05 even|_|04 whey|_|01 they are forewarned|_|01 about a specific|_|02 person|_|01 . the nightclub|_|01 attack|_|05 in orlando|_|01 seems|_|02 like|_|04 it could have been prevented|_|01 if the fbi|_|01 did their job|_|02 . they had warnings|_|01 from the killers|_|01 family|_|01 and basically|_|01 a warning|_|01 from the terrorist|_|01 himself . with extremist|_|01 like|_|04 this guy|_|03 , when they already|_|01 had him once , i think|_|05 more severe|_|02 tactics|_|01 are necessary|_|01 to protect|_|02 the country|_|04 and its citizens|_|01 . i feel|_|05 like|_|04 the fbi|_|01 is just making|_|27 excuses|_|01 because they were incompetent|_|04 and do not seem|_|02 to take|_|01 everything as serious|_|02 as they need|_|03 too . our country|_|04 deserves|_|01 that !
it is sad|_|02 that this is what is needed|_|02 to get|_|01 some people|_|03 to pay|_|05 attention|_|01 to the immense|_|01 damage|_|02 that has been and is continuing|_|06 to be done by global|_|01 warming|_|09 . something should not have to affect|_|01 you in order|_|15 for it to matter|_|02 . there are things|_|09 that are a lot|_|05 more important|_|01 than your coffee|_|01 fix|_|01 . for instance|_|01 , the people|_|03 - like|_|02 the people|_|03 in the story|_|02 - whose livelihoods|_|06 are being put|_|01 in danger|_|02 because of global|_|01 warming|_|09 .
a 6.4 magnitude|_|02 on the richter scale|_|05 earthquake|_|01 has shaken|_|09 up the whole|_|01 capital|_|01 of santiago|_|01 , chile|_|01 . chile|_|01 is very propensity|_|01 to earthquakes|_|01 and natural|_|05 disasters|_|01 . we have heard|_|02 of an earthquake|_|01 that scaled|_|08 out to be 8.8 and destroyed|_|03 over 200|_|01 thousand|_|01 homes|_|01 in chile|_|01 . i feel|_|12 very bad|_|01 for the people|_|03 who died|_|05 . and send|_|02 out my compassion|_|02 to the family|_|01 of the 55|_|01 dead|_|09 in this earthquake|_|01 .
when i read|_|09 this article|_|01 , to be honest|_|02 , i do not have any feeling|_|02 because i am not a fan|_|01 of all these artists|_|01 . i do listen|_|01 to pop|_|02 songs|_|01 , but i am not interested|_|01 in this copyright|_|01 issues|_|01 . i would say|_|01 that copy|_|02 right|_|01 is an important|_|01 part|_|10 for people|_|03 to obey|_|01 because it is a respect|_|02 to the knowledge|_|01 and author|_|01 .
i just read|_|06 an article|_|04 about women|_|02 encouraging|_|03 other women|_|02 to get|_|07 id|_|02 's before trump|_|02 took|_|06 office|_|01 . they were worried|_|02 that trump|_|02 in office|_|01 will restrict|_|03 omen|_|01 's access|_|04 to affordable|_|01 birth|_|01 control|_|02 . they think|_|10 because the iud|_|01 can last|_|01 for so long|_|01 that women|_|02 should get|_|07 them in soon|_|01 . i do n't think|_|10 these women|_|02 need|_|01 to be out getting|_|07 id|_|02 's , there are other ways|_|11 to prevent|_|02 pregnancy|_|01 . if they are really|_|01 concerned|_|01 , condoms|_|01 work|_|01 well|_|13 .
i thought|_|10 this was a pretty|_|01 interesting|_|01 article|_|04 . i learned|_|01 some things|_|09 about moldovan|_|01 politics|_|04 . it might|_|01 be relevant|_|01 to some of what you and i were talking|_|02 about some time|_|02 ago|_|01 . in any case|_|04 , it has some new|_|08 facts|_|02 that have come|_|04 to light|_|01 , as it were , new|_|08 information|_|02 or opinions|_|01 that i had not fully|_|01 considered|_|01 prior|_|02 to reading|_|03 this article|_|04 .

there is no way|_|11 the fbi|_|01 or any government|_|02 agency|_|04 could figure|_|01 out what a lone|_|02 wolf|_|04 terrorist|_|01 was going|_|03 to do . some terrorist|_|01 could walk|_|10 into anywhere|_|01 and just start|_|08 shooting|_|11 the place|_|01 up . it 's terrible|_|01 what the united|_|03 states|_|06 has become|_|01 . the only way|_|11 i see|_|01 to limit|_|03 terrorism|_|01 is to try|_|01 and limit|_|03 immigration|_|01 into the country|_|04 , but even|_|03 that does n't solve|_|01 things|_|08 . seems|_|04 like|_|02 if you do n't live|_|05 the right|_|08 kind|_|01 of life|_|08 to someone|_|01 , whether it 's being gay|_|05 etc . , then somebody|_|01 tries|_|01 to hurt|_|02 you . it 's terrible|_|01 .

ugh , another|_|01 example|_|04 of crappy|_|01 cops|_|05 . they think|_|03 they can get|_|01 anyway|_|01 with anything . i 've started|_|08 to pull|_|17 out my phone|_|01 camera|_|01 whenever i see|_|19 the cops|_|05 talking|_|02 to someone|_|01 , especially|_|01 if they are a minority|_|03 . police|_|01 brutality|_|01 is such a problem|_|01 in our country|_|04 and it 's just so deeply|_|01 ingrained|_|01 in the system|_|08 , i 'm not sure|_|02 what can be done . we need|_|02 some kind|_|01 of overhaul|_|01 of the criminal|_|03 justice|_|02 system|_|08 .

the article|_|04 that i read|_|03 was about these architects|_|01 that are building|_|07 things|_|01 and they are kind|_|01 of looking|_|02 at the tactics|_|01 for buildings|_|07 and their tools|_|01 that are used|_|01 to build|_|07 the buildings|_|07 . they want|_|03 to see|_|01 what will be safer|_|04 and allow|_|06 the people|_|03 to make|_|43 better|_|01 buildings|_|07 . there was a recent|_|03 mishap|_|02 that caused|_|02 several|_|01 people|_|03 to die|_|05 and it was related|_|01 to the building|_|07 issues|_|02 .
what a terrible|_|01 tragedy|_|02 ! accidents|_|01 like|_|02 this hit|_|02 families|_|06 so hard|_|02 ... and losing|_|01 both a father|_|01 and son|_|02 this way|_|06 ! the poor|_|01 family|_|06 must|_|01 be just beside themselves . it seems|_|02 too , if one|_|01 looks|_|02 at the circumstances|_|02 , that they were close|_|01 and enjoyed|_|02 doing things|_|09 together|_|03 . how very sad|_|02 . the rest|_|06 of the family|_|06 must|_|01 be just shaken|_|09 to the core|_|01 . hopefully|_|02 they are a tight|_|14 knit|_|03 group|_|03 with support|_|10 systems|_|06 . i hate|_|01 to hear|_|02 about anyone in accidents|_|01 , but this sort|_|01 of thing|_|09 is just too sad|_|02 .
did you hear|_|03 about the wolf|_|01 that got|_|21 shot|_|03 by a government|_|02 sniper|_|01 in idaho|_|01 i think|_|01 it was . he was a special|_|02 wolf|_|01 from a pack|_|06 in california|_|01 that was endangered|_|02 and had a tracking|_|01 device|_|05 on him so they could monitor|_|02 his|_|01 movements|_|04 . he had already|_|01 traveled|_|01 700 miles|_|08 looking|_|09 for a mate|_|03 , which is what wolves|_|01 do when they come|_|01 of age|_|01 . they are trying|_|03 to hold|_|03 them accountable|_|01 for the needless|_|01 and cruel|_|01 slaughter|_|03 of wild|_|01 animals|_|01 . i forgot|_|01 the name|_|05 of the group|_|01 . but i hope|_|03 they stop|_|18 them . animals|_|01 need|_|02 more laws|_|01 that protect|_|01 them from evil|_|01 garbage|_|03 people|_|01 .

this took|_|02 place|_|01 close|_|08 to where i live|_|02 so i can honestly|_|02 say|_|01 that it alarms|_|02 me . its a brutal|_|04 world|_|08 where this can happen|_|01 and its always|_|04 sad|_|02 . i noticed|_|04 the police|_|01 and courts|_|05 could have been more involved|_|01 in preventing|_|01 this but thatch|_|01 just how many|_|01 of the violent|_|03 stories|_|02 i 've been hearing|_|02 have gone|_|05 recently|_|01 .

like|_|02 i have said|_|09 before and will say|_|09 it till|_|01 i am blue|_|02 in the face|_|01 . i hate|_|01 donald trump|_|02 . he is not progressing|_|01 the united|_|01 states|_|04 of america|_|01 forward|_|01 . he says|_|09 his|_|01 new|_|05 slogan|_|01 is keep|_|06 america|_|01 great|_|01 , well|_|07 , buddy|_|01 , you got|_|02 to make|_|36 it great|_|02 in the first|_|01 place|_|01 . he is one|_|06 racist|_|01 , misogynistic|_|01 , egotistical|_|01 liar|_|01 and can not wait|_|01 till|_|01 he leave|_|03 , however|_|04 way|_|06 .
these type|_|06 of events|_|01 of bomb|_|05 explosions|_|02 and terrorist|_|01 threats|_|03 are extremely|_|01 dangerous|_|02 and should be taken|_|01 very seriously|_|01 . people|_|01 are just going|_|04 around|_|04 for their day|_|10 and they do n't really|_|01 know|_|01 what could happen|_|01 to them and these type|_|06 of incidents|_|01 are very tragic|_|01 and hurtful|_|01 . the security|_|09 measures|_|01 in the united|_|01 states|_|06 should be more careful|_|03 and should check|_|10 anyone that is suspicious|_|01 and make|_|43 the country|_|04 a safer|_|01 place|_|01 than how it already|_|01 is .
a hurricane|_|01 is about to hit|_|01 taiwan|_|02 soon|_|01 . it 's supposed|_|02 to be really|_|01 big|_|02 , the biggest|_|02 since 1969 . we just had some really|_|01 awful|_|02 hurricanes|_|01 in the west|_|08 too . the ones|_|02 here were caused|_|02 by global|_|01 warming|_|02 , so i wonder|_|03 if china|_|01 's are too ? it 's horrible|_|03 that so many|_|01 people|_|01 will lose|_|11 their homes|_|01 or their lives|_|11 just so rich|_|01 executives|_|02 can make|_|08 a few bucks|_|01 more .
this will not end|_|04 well|_|13 . people|_|01 have to improve|_|03 their own country|_|02 . taking|_|01 a shortcut|_|01 by moving|_|03 to a better|_|13 country|_|02 will just result|_|07 in the host|_|03 country|_|02 suffering|_|09 . the best|_|03 citizens|_|01 will work|_|03 hard|_|09 to improve|_|03 their country|_|02 . they will not give|_|01 up and leave|_|07 . lots|_|05 of blood|_|05 was shed|_|04 in many|_|01 of the countries|_|02 that migrants|_|01 seek|_|01 to live|_|02 in .
hey , i wonder|_|01 if this crash|_|02 is related|_|05 to terrorism|_|01 . i bet|_|08 it was . seems|_|02 like|_|02 big|_|01 accidents|_|01 nowadays|_|01 has something to do with terrorism|_|01 . you got|_|02 any family|_|08 from delaware|_|04 ? i do n't . there is one|_|05 thing|_|09 i know|_|01 , that i do n't want|_|01 to die|_|04 in a vehicle|_|02 accident|_|01 . that has to be terrible|_|01 . i guess|_|02 if it 's instant|_|01 death|_|04 then it 's okay|_|01 . i just do n't want|_|01 to suffer|_|10 for a long|_|01 time|_|02 . i hope|_|02 the people|_|03 taken|_|02 to the hospital|_|02 are okay|_|01 .

the united|_|03 states|_|06 should be ashamed|_|01 of how this last|_|02 election|_|04 went|_|01 . it was sad|_|01 that they could not be fair|_|01 to other countries|_|04 in the campaigning|_|01 . trump|_|01 bullied|_|02 other countries|_|04 and the other bullies|_|02 in the us|_|01 voter|_|01 for him . there is no reason|_|02 why such a fool|_|01 should be running|_|14 our country|_|04 . i know|_|05 as americans|_|01 anyone can become|_|01 president|_|02 , but that does not mean|_|04 that they do not have to be presidential|_|02 material|_|01 .
wow|_|02 , it is pretty|_|02 sad|_|02 to see|_|01 a happy|_|04 family|_|01 be devastated|_|01 by a preventable|_|01 cause|_|01 . i send|_|02 my prayers|_|05 out to whomever was in immediate|_|04 relations|_|01 with the family|_|01 . this makes|_|45 me be more grateful|_|02 for everyday|_|01 life|_|01 because i really|_|01 do n't know|_|07 when my last|_|02 day|_|10 will be . i hope|_|02 the fire|_|09 department|_|03 workers|_|02 are emotionally|_|02 well|_|01 , because i know|_|07 it can be distressful|_|01 to see|_|01 these things|_|08 happen|_|04
those poor|_|02 boys|_|01 . they never|_|02 asked|_|01 for any of this . their father|_|01 be a died|_|06 beat|_|02 dad|_|01 and kill|_|13 them . what a completely|_|01 asshole|_|01 to scared|_|01 jerk|_|01 . the boys|_|01 were so young|_|01 and helpless|_|02 with a dead|_|13 beat|_|02 dad|_|01 . the man|_|09 should of just killed|_|13 himself and left|_|06 those 2|_|01 boys|_|01 out of it . what did he accomplish|_|01 by killing|_|13 his|_|01 sons|_|02 ? i have no words|_|02 to describe|_|01 how much|_|01 pain|_|04 those 2|_|01 little|_|08 ones|_|02 were probably|_|01 in . its shame|_|02 when kids|_|05 have to take|_|01 fault|_|05 for their parents|_|01 misfortunes|_|01 . and that mother|_|01 . the heart|_|10 ache|_|01 she will have to face|_|11 of losing|_|05 not only 1|_|01 son|_|02 but 2|_|01 . i can not imagine|_|02 the sorrow|_|02 that would cause|_|02 .
can you believe|_|01 this happened|_|04 ? ugh . how scary|_|01 ! i realize|_|02 that people|_|01 can be angry|_|03 with each other , but pushing|_|02 someone|_|01 in front|_|02 of a train|_|01 ? ? ? it is amazing|_|01 to me that people|_|01 are so out of control|_|02 that they ca|_|01 n't even|_|01 handle|_|02 a verbal|_|06 dispute|_|02 with someone|_|01 . its easy|_|02 , just walk|_|01 away|_|02 ! i guess|_|02 i should stay|_|10 away|_|02 from the train|_|01 platform|_|02

i am crushed|_|08 after hearing|_|02 about the conditions|_|06 in haiti|_|01 after hurricane|_|01 matthew|_|02 hit|_|01 the area|_|01 . the people|_|01 are literally|_|02 starving|_|02 to death|_|05 and the injured|_|01 and sick|_|06 do not have access|_|04 to enough|_|01 , if any medical|_|02 care|_|01 . there are areas|_|01 that are completely|_|01 inaccessible|_|02 to aid|_|01 , either|_|01 medically|_|01 or food|_|03 or water|_|02 supplies|_|01 . there is extensive|_|03 looting|_|03 in haiti|_|01 and the situation|_|01 is extremely|_|01 dangerous|_|02 even|_|03 for those that try|_|05 to bring|_|02 in supplies|_|01 to the people|_|01 living|_|01 there . my heart|_|01 is breaking|_|02 as i think|_|13 of all the people|_|01 , children|_|03 and adults|_|02 in haiti|_|01 . it is a country|_|01 that still|_|01 has not recovered|_|01 from the earthquake|_|02 that happened|_|01 there years|_|03 before . i think|_|13 that our country|_|01 should continue|_|04 to report|_|03 on these terrible|_|01 conditions|_|06 and try|_|05 to get|_|02 aid|_|01 to haiti|_|01 from every|_|02 source|_|04 available|_|03 .
i think|_|03 there is enough|_|02 information|_|01 about the health|_|02 hazards|_|01 of smoking|_|01 for it to be understood|_|01 why it should be outlawed|_|01 in most public|_|02 places|_|01 . it is something that should be done in the privacy|_|02 of people|_|01 's homes|_|01 , right|_|07 ? it makes|_|43 sense|_|01 to me . as for the rest|_|04 of the information|_|01 here about food|_|03 safety|_|02 , i do n't trust|_|06 most any public|_|02 food|_|03 establishment|_|02 . i 've seen|_|05 too many|_|01 nasty|_|02 kitchens|_|01 and bathrooms|_|01 to trust|_|06 a place|_|01 to be clean|_|02 when it counts|_|08 !
hi|_|01 n. just wanting|_|01 to talk|_|02 to somebody|_|01 and you as always|_|02 you are the right|_|12 person|_|01 to reach|_|05 to . i just read|_|03 an article|_|04 on the matthew|_|01 and the destruction|_|01 it left|_|08 in haiti|_|01 . i was overwhelmed|_|02 and i almost|_|07 can not believe|_|01 how many|_|01 people|_|01 were affected|_|01 and not just that but they were suffering|_|03 from all kinds|_|01 of unimaginable|_|02 things|_|11 . hunger|_|02 was the first|_|01 to list|_|03 , there was a lot|_|05 a starvation|_|02 , people|_|01 were poring|_|02 from all over when aid|_|01 was coming|_|04 to bring|_|02 them food|_|03 aid|_|01 with trucks|_|01 . disease|_|01 was everywhere|_|01 , doctors|_|04 coming|_|04 from all over the world|_|08 had to face|_|03 with cholera|_|01 and disease|_|01 . infrastructure|_|02 was damaged|_|02 , homes|_|01 destroyed|_|02 . it is really|_|01 hard|_|01 to express|_|04 in words|_|02 all the suffering|_|03 the people|_|01 had to deal|_|01 with . i feel|_|05 like|_|02 there should be something we should do to help|_|05 .
oh|_|01 man|_|08 , i feel|_|04 perturbed|_|01 . why do people|_|01 have to keep|_|02 suffering|_|03 and dying|_|05 so we can understand|_|01 that strict|_|03 gun|_|01 control|_|02 is necessary|_|01 , who needs|_|03 to die|_|05 ? how many|_|01 people|_|01 ? this is just a sad|_|02 and crazy|_|01 story|_|02 repeating|_|01 itself , over and over again . we need|_|03 to understand|_|01 that as long|_|02 as anyone can get|_|03 a gun|_|01 , nobody|_|04 is safe|_|02 .

i 'm not so sure|_|07 that there is any right|_|12 in this situation|_|01 , of course|_|04 it was wrong|_|07 what he did and he could have handled|_|01 this another|_|01 way|_|11 . he did what he did for his|_|01 own reasons|_|02 and he ca|_|01 n't take|_|06 that back|_|06 and he definitely|_|01 does not feel|_|05 sorry|_|01 for what he did . was it so serious|_|01 just because he is the mayor|_|01 and would it not been so serious|_|01 if he was n't a mayor|_|01 ? could he have done something better|_|09 with the money|_|03 ? absolutely|_|01 , so he is n't wrong|_|07 when he says|_|01 the money|_|03 should have been used|_|01 for other things|_|08 , but throwing|_|04 a pie|_|01 in someones|_|01 face|_|08 probably|_|01 is n't the best|_|03 way|_|11 to show|_|01 it

yeah|_|01 so global|_|01 warming|_|10 is really|_|01 messing|_|01 with the polar|_|03 bear|_|02 and the glaciers|_|01 , if the earth|_|04 continues|_|02 to melt|_|09 and the glaciers|_|01 continue|_|02 to melt|_|09 then we could be looking|_|02 at the extension|_|08 of the polar|_|03 bear|_|02 , the disappearance|_|02 of our glacier|_|01 and mass|_|02 ma flooding|_|02 . luckily|_|01 they eat|_|02 a lot|_|02 of people|_|03 keeping|_|02 a close|_|01 eye|_|05 the sea|_|03 levels|_|07 and working|_|03 on how to slow|_|03 the warming|_|10 of our planet|_|01 .
check|_|23 out this news|_|04 article|_|04 . it 's absolutely|_|01 infuriating|_|01 that this sort|_|03 of thing|_|08 would happen|_|02 yet|_|04 again , not only from a big|_|01 oil|_|01 and gas|_|01 company|_|03 , but specifically|_|01 from bp again . their ineffable|_|02 ineptitude|_|01 constantly|_|02 leads|_|05 to environmental|_|02 disasters|_|03 and someone|_|01 has to put|_|07 a stop|_|06 to their bs|_|01 before we let|_|02 them completely|_|01 destroy|_|04 our habitat|_|01 here on earth|_|01 .

global|_|01 warming|_|01 is an issue|_|01 that has been brewing|_|02 for some time|_|06 and seems|_|04 to be getting|_|11 torn|_|05 in all directions|_|02 as it is not a grey|_|01 issue|_|01 but a black|_|05 and white|_|12 issue|_|01 meaning|_|01 it is either|_|01 happening|_|01 or it is not . it is hard|_|01 to see|_|01 which side|_|10 has the more valid|_|01 argument|_|01 over the other since everyone involved|_|01 is so passionate|_|01 about their side|_|10 of it all .
did you hear|_|02 that the very first|_|02 female|_|02 us|_|01 attorney|_|01 general|_|03 died|_|04 recent|_|01 at 78|_|01 . she was put|_|01 in under clinton|_|04 though|_|01 so she was probably|_|01 very corrupt|_|01 and did a lot|_|05 of bad|_|01 things|_|01 over the course|_|07 of her career|_|02 . but she went|_|01 to harvard|_|01 so she must|_|01 have been pretty|_|01 smart|_|12 regardless|_|01 . she was also|_|02 the one|_|02 who got|_|01 a little|_|03 boy|_|04 sent|_|01 back|_|03 to cuba|_|02 which is just horrible|_|03 since they are living|_|01 in horrible|_|03 conditions|_|03 with a horrible|_|03 government|_|02 that abuses|_|01 them .
i just read|_|03 an article|_|04 about the awful|_|02 treatment|_|01 of animals|_|01 of zoos|_|02 in foreign|_|02 countries|_|04 from us|_|01 . feeling|_|05 a little|_|03 down thinking|_|01 of how these people|_|01 could treat|_|03 the animals|_|01 how they could continue|_|02 to raise|_|02 animals|_|01 in zoos|_|02 where people|_|01 will come|_|16 and view|_|05 them while they 're ill|_|03 hurt|_|04 and some even|_|03 dying|_|10 . even|_|03 after receiving|_|02 help|_|02 to get|_|02 these animals|_|01 to a better|_|20 location|_|01 where they can be cared|_|02 for properly|_|01 other zoos|_|02 are still|_|01 continuing|_|02 with bad|_|01 treatment|_|01 and allowing|_|01 visitors|_|01 to come|_|16 witness|_|05 it . just like|_|02 a child|_|01 animals|_|01 depend|_|08 on us|_|01 if we have them caged|_|01 either|_|01 let|_|01 them out of the cage|_|01 or take|_|15 care|_|02 of them why is that so hard|_|11 for people|_|01 to understand|_|01 or do ?
i hope|_|03 everyone is ok|_|01 . i was in a small|_|04 earthquake|_|02 and it was extremely|_|01 scary|_|01 . a lot|_|05 of people|_|01 can die|_|03 if you do n't have safe|_|02 buildings|_|07 . i think|_|02 there should be a major|_|06 international|_|01 effort|_|01 to provide|_|06 guidance|_|01 for any nations|_|04 in an earthquake|_|02 prone|_|02 region|_|05 so that we can do a little|_|02 bit|_|10 to prevent|_|02 more deaths|_|04 when the earthquakes|_|02 inevitably|_|01 hit|_|05 .
this is the type|_|06 of thing|_|02 that really|_|01 scares|_|01 me . i would be very interested|_|01 in viewing|_|03 this video|_|01 . how in the world|_|01 does one|_|01 shoot|_|01 their own relatives|_|01 and two|_|01 police|_|01 officers|_|01 ? what gives|_|01 this person|_|01 the right|_|01 to take|_|02 someone|_|01 else|_|03 life|_|08 ? those people|_|01 may|_|01 have had children|_|03 , mothers|_|01 , sisters|_|03 , friends|_|01 , co|_|01 - workers|_|02 , and now they are dead|_|01 , and for what ? how did this individual|_|01 go|_|01 so long|_|01 without being apprehended|_|01 . sometimes|_|01 the system|_|02 really|_|01 confuses|_|01 me and upsets|_|02 me . i wish|_|01 they would have caught|_|24 him sooner|_|01 and kept|_|02 him alive|_|01 so he could explain|_|03 his|_|01 actions|_|01 .
reading|_|06 the article|_|04 , i was disgusted|_|02 knowing|_|01 that a father|_|01 had not only killed|_|01 himself but took|_|06 away|_|06 the lives|_|01 of his|_|01 two|_|01 sons|_|02 as well|_|13 . the only reason|_|03 why that man|_|08 even|_|01 killed|_|01 himself was that the police|_|01 saw|_|01 him killing|_|01 his|_|01 two|_|01 children|_|02 . people|_|01 in this world|_|08 today|_|01 should n't lose|_|06 their lives|_|01 due|_|02 to a crazy|_|01 / selfish|_|01 elder|_|03 .
looks|_|03 like|_|04 american|_|02 apparel|_|01 is at it again and declaring|_|08 bankruptcy|_|02 . ironically|_|02 they are getting|_|01 bought|_|01 out by a canadian|_|01 company|_|01 . i feel|_|05 sorry|_|01 for the employees|_|01 , but its hard|_|02 to feel|_|05 sorry|_|01 for the company|_|01 since they just font|_|01 seem|_|02 to get|_|01 it . i think|_|03 one|_|06 chance|_|02 is fair|_|07 , but when you have to declare|_|08 bankruptcy|_|02 again a year|_|03 later|_|01 your management|_|02 does n't seem|_|02 to know|_|11 what they are doing . maybe|_|01 the company|_|01 that bought|_|01 them will finally|_|01 get|_|01 it right|_|04 .
i feel|_|05 really|_|01 bad|_|01 for these orangutans|_|01 . they must|_|01 have been treated|_|03 so bad|_|01 to be in the condition|_|05 they are in when they were found|_|01 . those things|_|11 should never|_|02 have been bought|_|04 and trades|_|01 and put|_|02 in a domesticated|_|03 situation|_|02 . it 's good|_|17 that they 're being taken|_|01 care|_|02 of . hopefully|_|01 they can recover|_|01 and go|_|01 back|_|03 to where they came|_|04 from .
here is an article|_|02 i just read|_|06 about an accident|_|01 at an amusement|_|01 park|_|02 in australia|_|02 . i 've never|_|02 heard|_|02 of dreamworld|_|01 , have you ? but the ride|_|02 sounds|_|03 like|_|02 the old|_|01 shoot|_|02 the rapids|_|01 we used|_|01 to ride|_|02 on at cedar|_|02 point|_|03 . in this case|_|20 , the boat|_|01 tipped|_|01 over and people|_|01 got|_|01 trapped|_|04 in the conveyor|_|01 belt|_|02 . i ca|_|01 n't even|_|01 imagine|_|02 what the last|_|02 moment|_|01 of those people|_|01 's lives|_|01 must|_|01 have been like|_|02 . as for the kids|_|02 who saw|_|01 it all happen-- there are no words|_|07 ! at least|_|01 none|_|02 of the children|_|02 died|_|01 in the accident|_|01 . but now they have lost|_|01 a parent|_|01 . one|_|04 of those kids|_|02 was just a baby|_|01 . now she will never|_|02 know|_|11 her mother|_|01 . i never|_|02 thought|_|03 about rides|_|02 failing|_|04 when we were kids|_|02 and used|_|01 to go|_|01 to amusement|_|01 parks|_|02 , but now i would probably|_|01 not ride|_|02 on any of that stuff|_|01 .
i ca|_|01 n't believe|_|03 wells|_|05 fargo|_|01 would do this in such a unprofessional|_|01 manner|_|01 . repossessing|_|01 vehicles|_|03 without going|_|02 through the proper|_|02 procedures|_|07 . especially|_|01 screwing|_|01 over people|_|01 who protect|_|02 our country|_|04 . i hope|_|02 their fines|_|01 were huge|_|01 . they are going|_|02 to have to do a lot|_|05 of changing|_|06 if they want|_|05 to get|_|02 the trust|_|04 of their customers|_|01 back|_|04 . i for one|_|04 never|_|02 plan|_|03 on using|_|01 them .
i felt|_|03 extremely|_|01 bad|_|01 and horrible|_|03 for the child|_|04 that fell|_|08 down like|_|02 that . i also|_|02 felt|_|03 very sad|_|02 and disturbed|_|11 when they found|_|02 him dead|_|01 about four|_|01 days|_|07 later|_|01 . the poor|_|01 child|_|04 should have been taken|_|24 care|_|02 of more and looked|_|02 after so that nothing|_|01 would have happened|_|01 to him then . i think|_|05 that this whole|_|02 thing|_|09 is such a horrible|_|03 tragedy|_|01 and that it also|_|02 could have been prevented|_|02 as well|_|09 .
the chicago|_|03 district|_|01 has shutdown|_|07 about twenty|_|01 five|_|01 percent|_|01 of there public|_|01 drinking|_|01 fountains|_|03 . they have found|_|01 levels|_|02 of lead|_|02 that are great|_|02 in this area|_|01 . it is believed|_|01 that about one|_|06 out of seven|_|01 children|_|04 have levels|_|02 of lead|_|02 in their system|_|08 that the epa|_|01 deems|_|01 too high|_|02 . after the outbreak|_|01 in flint|_|03 , i can see|_|05 for their concerns|_|02 .
i feel|_|05 that racism|_|01 is still|_|04 alive|_|01 today|_|02 and it is a big|_|08 problem|_|01 people|_|01 need|_|01 to realize|_|02 that color|_|08 does n't matter|_|02 and that we are all humans|_|02 with feeling|_|02 and no one|_|02 person|_|01 is better|_|03 than the other regardless|_|01 of the color|_|08 of there skin|_|04 . there should be stronger|_|09 laws|_|03 helping|_|01 fight|_|05 racism|_|01 also|_|02 teaching|_|02 kids|_|02 that its not ok|_|01 to call|_|02 people|_|01 names|_|05 just cause|_|01 of there skin|_|04 color|_|08 . we need|_|01 to work|_|03 as a nation|_|04 to fix|_|02 this problem|_|01
it 's nice|_|03 that these cases|_|06 are critiqued|_|02 so thoroughly|_|02 as once an execution|_|01 has started|_|09 , there 's no going|_|03 back|_|03 . it sounds|_|02 like|_|02 he shot|_|17 his|_|01 relative|_|01 for sure|_|07 though|_|01 . even|_|04 though|_|01 he maybe|_|01 did n't kill|_|01 the husband|_|01 of the woman|_|02 he had an affair|_|01 with , one|_|01 murder|_|01 should potentially|_|01 be enough|_|01 for the death|_|08 penalty|_|01 .
this is a sad|_|01 state|_|02 of affairs|_|01 , but what do you expect|_|04 from a country|_|02 that is as corrupt|_|02 as russia|_|01 . the ruling|_|05 class|_|03 has a stranglehold|_|01 on the wealth|_|01 and the average|_|01 person|_|03 gets|_|14 next|_|01 to nothing|_|01 . the country|_|02 is barely|_|01 a step|_|04 above a third|_|01 world|_|03 country|_|02 in most parts|_|03 , while the rich|_|01 get|_|01 richer|_|01 and putin|_|01 profits|_|01 . there is not that much|_|01 difference|_|03 now than in the 70|_|01 's and 80|_|01 's except|_|01 now the corruption|_|01 is out in the open|_|02 and there are billionaires|_|01 all over the place|_|01 .
i think|_|03 if someone|_|01 is going|_|01 to take|_|29 on that responsibility|_|02 in raising|_|03 cattle|_|01 they should at least|_|01 know|_|01 what they are doing . this guy|_|03 , buddy|_|01 , does not care|_|02 for them . they hardly|_|02 have food|_|03 or water|_|06 . they get|_|01 no interaction|_|02 so when they do need|_|01 to round|_|01 them up , they 're mean|_|05 . that should be illegal|_|01 . i 'm surprised|_|01 he has not been caught|_|19 yet|_|01 . he is very lucky|_|06 because when he get|_|01 caught|_|19 he will regret|_|02 not taking|_|29 proper|_|04 care|_|01 of them .
i think|_|02 this world|_|08 is full|_|06 of hate|_|01 and i do n't understand|_|03 it . why do they hate|_|01 us|_|01 ? why are they killing|_|01 innocent|_|07 people?and donald trump|_|02 is n't going|_|02 to make|_|43 anything better|_|07 . he shows|_|01 people|_|01 hate|_|01 and we might|_|01 have even|_|04 more terrorist|_|01 coming|_|04 to america|_|01 . america|_|01 should show|_|01 people|_|01 how to love|_|02 . america|_|01 acts|_|02 like|_|02 the victim|_|02 but we have fault|_|01 as well|_|07 . there is no country|_|04 that is right|_|12 or wrong|_|05 we are all human|_|03 and we are all imperfect|_|01 . the only king|_|07 we should listen|_|02 to is god|_|03 . a lot|_|05 of these presidents|_|01 and kings|_|07 of our countries|_|04 think|_|02 there god|_|03 . we should humble|_|01 ourselves and just love|_|02 . put|_|01 ourselves in other peoples|_|01 shoes|_|02 .
hey guys|_|01 check|_|10 this article|_|04 out . i was talking|_|02 to about this sleep|_|02 paralysis|_|01 thing|_|09 . it 's such a scary|_|01 event|_|01 i do no wish|_|02 upon anyone . i 've experienced|_|05 it in the past|_|02 and is no fun|_|03 . some people|_|03 hear|_|02 voices|_|06 , others see|_|10 ghosts|_|01 or the likes|_|02 . i hope|_|01 you guys|_|01 never|_|01 have to experience|_|05 such a thing|_|09 . it 's good|_|01 thing|_|09 to know|_|05 that it has a medical|_|02 term|_|01 and is not something actually|_|02 paranormal|_|02 .
in shocked|_|01 at the possibility|_|04 , and now at the direct|_|01 knowledge|_|01 that the opiate|_|01 crisis|_|02 in america|_|01 not only affects|_|05 older|_|07 people|_|01 ( adults|_|02 ) , but also|_|02 very young|_|01 children|_|01 as well|_|11 . opiate|_|01 overdoses|_|01 are sad|_|02 and brutal|_|04 but the same thing|_|08 for a child|_|01 stirs|_|02 shock|_|01 and sadness|_|02 within|_|02 me to think|_|01 of the reasons|_|06 it occurs|_|03 and that could certainly|_|01 be prevented|_|02 .
i was just reading|_|03 this article|_|04 and thinking|_|09 about how lucky|_|01 we are to not have to experience|_|01 such things|_|05 . even|_|04 when major|_|08 weather|_|01 events|_|01 or natural|_|04 disasters|_|03 are close|_|01 by , we have the ability|_|02 evacuate|_|05 and miss|_|09 the real|_|03 damage|_|02 . i 've never|_|02 had to deal|_|08 with anything like|_|02 this and i think|_|09 it would be so difficult|_|02 -- i wonder|_|02 how the community|_|01 will come|_|15 together|_|05 to support|_|02 each other . it is so sad|_|02 that so much|_|01 destruction|_|01 can happen|_|02 so quickly|_|01 and totally|_|01 upend|_|02 the lives|_|03 of so many|_|01 .
it is really|_|01 sad|_|02 this country|_|02 is still|_|04 having major|_|08 issues|_|02 with prejudice|_|01 and inequality|_|01 . being a minority|_|03 myself , i feel|_|04 for the muslims|_|01 and others who faced|_|02 terrible|_|01 treatment|_|01 just because of their heritage|_|04 . i hope|_|02 you do n't have to experience|_|05 these terrible|_|01 things|_|11 as they have . i would be really|_|01 careful|_|04 who you talk|_|01 to just to be on the safe|_|02 side|_|04 . it is an unpredictable|_|02 world|_|03 we live|_|07 in today|_|01 sadly|_|02 .
the people|_|01 who will lose|_|08 homes|_|01 because of this should be fully|_|01 compensated|_|02 and be fully|_|01 relocated|_|02 with full|_|06 government|_|02 assistance|_|02 and be transferred|_|01 to a different|_|01 location|_|01 that is still|_|04 nearby|_|01 their old|_|01 homes|_|01 that will be razed|_|02 . it 's just not fair|_|07 if they will be leaving|_|01 these people|_|01 homeless|_|02 and will probably|_|01 have a hard|_|01 time|_|06 coping|_|05 with the loss|_|01 of their house|_|01 if this plan|_|03 gets|_|01 approved|_|02 .
hey friend|_|01 did you check|_|10 out this article|_|02 . we should do our best|_|03 to protect|_|02 ourselves and our loved|_|01 ones|_|02 from erika . i know|_|10 that when my wife|_|01 was pregnant|_|01 i paid|_|05 close|_|15 attention|_|01 to the news|_|04 in order|_|14 to be up to date|_|07 with developments|_|01 . it is really|_|01 sad|_|02 to see|_|10 children|_|04 being born|_|01 with microphone|_|01 . i really|_|01 hope|_|03 something will be done .
i am deeply|_|01 disturbed|_|02 by what i have read|_|03 in this article|_|04 . it seems|_|04 that a man|_|08 committed|_|01 a senseless|_|01 act|_|02 of murder|_|01 by pouring|_|06 flammable|_|01 liquid|_|04 on an innocent|_|07 bus|_|01 driver|_|05 and setting|_|05 him afire|_|02 . there is never|_|02 an acceptable|_|02 excuse|_|02 for such an act|_|02 . i can only guess|_|01 that racism|_|02 is the motivation|_|03 for the act|_|02 as the victim|_|02 was a member|_|02 of the indian|_|01 community|_|01 .
keisha the singer|_|03 opened|_|04 up about how she was treated|_|05 in the music|_|05 industry|_|02 ... it 's so crazy|_|03 how time|_|02 after time|_|02 these pop|_|01 stars|_|04 , rappers|_|01 an singers|_|03 come|_|04 out with these stories|_|02 about how they got|_|01 cheated|_|02 , or that they find|_|10 out that their manager|_|01 had been stealing|_|01 from them for years|_|03 , or giving|_|01 them advice|_|01 that does n't actually|_|04 serve|_|01 the artist|_|01 . the problem|_|01 is that a lot|_|05 of these artists|_|01 go|_|03 into the music|_|05 industry|_|02 naive|_|01 and desperate|_|04 and just take|_|02 whatever|_|01 hey can get|_|01 ... whatever|_|01 led|_|03 , just to get|_|01 their foot|_|01 in the door|_|01 but just end|_|01 up getting|_|01 screwed|_|01 ,
for days|_|10 , a hazy|_|01 pall|_|02 has spread|_|04 across|_|02 much|_|01 of northern|_|01 georgia|_|01 , including|_|03 metro|_|01 atlanta|_|01 , home|_|03 to 5.7 million|_|01 people|_|01 . state|_|04 officials|_|02 warned|_|03 that the air|_|01 is unhealthy|_|03 , and cautioned|_|01 people|_|01 with breathing|_|04 problems|_|01 to stay|_|05 indoors|_|01 as much|_|05 as possible|_|01 . with state|_|04 firefighters|_|04 scrambling|_|05 to quench|_|02 the blazes|_|01 currently|_|02 active|_|11 , officials|_|02 told|_|01 people|_|01 to avoid|_|01 starting|_|06 new|_|12 fires|_|03 that could quickly|_|01 spread|_|04 . “ we ’re a cigar|_|01 butt|_|01 away|_|06 from a disaster|_|02 , ” said|_|01 john|_|03 williams|_|06 , adventure|_|01 guide|_|03 at dynamical|_|01 falls|_|01 , a state|_|04 park|_|01 near|_|01 the southern|_|01 terminus|_|04 of the appalachian|_|01 trail|_|02 in georgia|_|01
hello|_|01 , i thought|_|01 this behavior|_|04 was a thing|_|11 of the past|_|02 , but read|_|05 this article|_|02 , it is rather|_|01 enlightening|_|01 . i often|_|05 think|_|01 here in the us|_|01 there is a great|_|02 divide|_|01 on how racial|_|02 issues|_|02 are dealt|_|02 with , and the us|_|01 is not the only one|_|02 . there are many|_|01 racial|_|02 problems|_|01 in other countries|_|04 and that makes|_|43 me feel|_|05 hopeless|_|04 for the future|_|03 . if we ca|_|01 n't fix|_|02 the issues|_|02 here in america|_|01 , how can we criticize|_|02 other countries|_|04 ?
those of you who smoke|_|01 should quit|_|01 . once we quit|_|01 , we 're often|_|05 surprised|_|02 at the changes|_|08 in attitude|_|01 we experience|_|01 regarding|_|05 smoking|_|07 , and life|_|03 in general|_|03 . when we quit|_|01 and win|_|01 our freedom|_|01 from addiction|_|03 , our mindset|_|01 changes|_|08 . after i quit|_|01 i came|_|04 to realize|_|02 how much|_|01 i really|_|01 do n't like|_|02 it ! i think|_|02 i care|_|01 more about myself now : my health|_|02 , i stand|_|04 up for myself when appropriate|_|01 , i feel|_|05 like|_|02 there are more possibilities|_|04 out there now without my smoking|_|07 monkey|_|01 on my back|_|01 .
this is just part|_|01 of the troubling|_|01 times|_|06 we live|_|01 in . there is a monster|_|01 in the white|_|07 house|_|01 that a majority|_|01 of the people|_|01 did not elect|_|02 and the russian|_|01 government|_|02 had a hand|_|06 in coming|_|13 to power|_|02 . he is breaking|_|02 laws|_|01 everyday|_|03 and has the most corrupt|_|01 cabinet|_|02 in my lifetime|_|05 . his|_|01 agenda|_|02 is simply|_|01 to cause|_|02 chaos|_|04 and to profit|_|02 off this as much|_|01 as possible|_|01 . the sooner|_|01 this failed|_|08 experiment|_|02 is over the better|_|13 of the nation|_|04 will be . the only hope|_|02 is that he does n't start|_|03 a nuclear|_|01 war|_|04 and that he will eventually|_|01 be tried|_|01 and brought|_|11 to justice|_|01 for his|_|01 numerous|_|01 crimes|_|02 .
we need|_|02 to destroy|_|04 the system|_|04 that allows|_|01 these things|_|05 to happen|_|03 . capitalism|_|01 that reinforces|_|02 these disgusting|_|02 habits|_|01 must|_|01 be destroyed|_|04 utterly|_|01 and the christian|_|01 religion|_|02 should be wiped|_|01 out in its entirety|_|01 . there is no excuse|_|01 for this kind|_|01 of repulsive|_|01 behavior|_|01 that drives|_|02 people|_|01 to abuse|_|03 these children|_|04 .
i said|_|01 trump|_|02 would win|_|05 . polls|_|05 said|_|01 otherwise|_|01 , i did n't care|_|02 , i knew|_|01 the fucker|_|01 would win|_|05 . i think|_|01 people|_|01 are not willing|_|01 to accept|_|02 that others are really|_|01 shitty|_|01 and that someone|_|01 like|_|02 trump|_|02 would be voted|_|01 in . they ca|_|01 n't see|_|05 past|_|01 others . people|_|01 have too much|_|01 faith|_|02 in others , too much|_|01 trust|_|03 . there are a lot|_|05 of vile|_|01 people|_|01 out there , just got|_|01 ta|_|01 encourage|_|03 them a little|_|02 bit|_|04 and they 'll come|_|04 out . trump|_|02 was their encouragement|_|03 . what will the liberals|_|02 do now ? i do n't know|_|01 . sometimes|_|01 i think|_|01 we will be okay|_|01 , sometimes|_|01 i think|_|01 we wo n't . i just know|_|01 that going|_|03 to one|_|01 march|_|04 is going|_|03 to do shit|_|04 . you need|_|01 tens|_|01 of marches|_|04 , packed|_|02 to the brim|_|02 . you need|_|01 them every|_|01 weekend|_|01 . for months|_|01 . you need|_|01 to call|_|03 your officials|_|02 , complain|_|01 , elect|_|01 them , vote|_|01 them out . do more . but one|_|01 march|_|04 is n't going|_|03 to do shit|_|01 .
here we go|_|01 again , talking|_|05 about political|_|01 figures|_|04 forging|_|02 and waging|_|01 war|_|01 for the popular|_|02 vote|_|01 . they switch|_|04 sides|_|10 and change|_|01 their point|_|20 of view|_|03 so much|_|01 that it is easy|_|03 to say|_|01 they do n't care|_|02 about the common|_|06 person|_|01 , only their chair|_|01 in office|_|06 . i think|_|03 that the parties|_|05 have merged|_|06 into one|_|01 , one|_|01 mass|_|03 all out war|_|01 to get|_|02 into office|_|06 .
i read|_|06 an article|_|04 about a man|_|08 who was caught|_|18 smashing|_|09 donald trump|_|02 's star|_|01 in hollywood|_|02 . he had a sledgehammer|_|01 and was smashing|_|09 it . i thought|_|12 it sounded|_|02 pretty|_|01 funny|_|02 . the article|_|04 described|_|02 some of the ways|_|01 people|_|01 are protesting|_|03 , from covering|_|01 the star|_|01 with graffiti|_|01 , to putting|_|04 a bernie sanders|_|01 sticker|_|03 on it , to putting|_|04 a barbed|_|02 wire|_|01 fence|_|02 around|_|02 it . i do n't like|_|02 that he even|_|01 has a star|_|01 , and i think|_|12 if i were to go|_|02 to hollywood|_|02 , i 'd like|_|02 to do something like|_|02 this as well|_|01 .
man|_|09 that 's tough|_|07 to read- i remember|_|07 watching|_|06 those events|_|03 unfold|_|04 and just being absolutely|_|01 miserable|_|05 and horrified|_|02 over it . i remember|_|07 hearing|_|02 that they were killing|_|01 hostages|_|01 one|_|06 by one|_|06 on the news|_|01 , and just bursting|_|09 into tears|_|04 at that point|_|20 . this article|_|02 really|_|01 vividly|_|01 reminded|_|01 me of that moment|_|01 , it 's really|_|01 sad|_|02 .
this is the world|_|08 we live|_|01 in now . until we have heavy|_|03 weapons|_|02 that are meant|_|04 for killing|_|01 like|_|02 guns|_|01 , explosives|_|01 , and machines|_|01 , we will never|_|02 have an end|_|02 in the conflict|_|01 in middle|_|04 east|_|05 -- or any country|_|02 for that matter|_|02 . if it does finish|_|02 , a lot|_|05 of people|_|01 will suffer|_|01 and die|_|11 first|_|02 which is worrisome|_|01 . millions|_|02 and millions|_|02 of people|_|01 experience|_|01 subhuman|_|02 living|_|06 conditions|_|03 and there 's nothing|_|01 we can do .
i certainly|_|01 feel|_|06 bad|_|03 for people|_|01 having to live|_|05 in such horrible|_|03 conditions|_|01 . however|_|01 , i also|_|02 feel|_|06 bad|_|03 for the regions|_|03 that these refugees|_|01 are going|_|01 to . it has to be a huge|_|01 strain|_|04 on these countries|_|04 to accept|_|07 large|_|01 numbers|_|01 of homeless|_|02 that will just depress|_|05 their economy|_|04 . it is a tough|_|03 situation|_|02 and i can see|_|01 both sides|_|03 of it .
i think|_|01 these people|_|01 have been fighting|_|06 each other over tribalism|_|02 and ideology|_|01 since i can remember|_|02 . in talking|_|02 about iraq|_|01 , which is dividing|_|02 into 3|_|01 main|_|03 groups|_|01 who have competed|_|01 for limited|_|01 resources|_|01 for a long|_|01 time|_|02 . and the wealth|_|03 of oil|_|01 taken|_|01 by the leaders|_|01 and not shared|_|01 with prosperity|_|02 for all people|_|01 has increased|_|02 tensions|_|06 . when i was young|_|01 it was iraq|_|01 iran|_|01 war|_|01 , the saddam|_|01 hussein|_|01 reign|_|01 of terror|_|04 , then the first|_|02 gulf|_|03 war|_|01 , the the second|_|02 iraq|_|01 war|_|01 , then isis|_|01 . these people|_|01 have something wrong|_|01 with them and i think|_|01 they bear|_|06 some responsibility|_|03 for their own suffering|_|03 .
this right|_|01 here is bullshit|_|01 . i do n't know|_|01 who wrote|_|10 this shit|_|01 article|_|04 but from what i read|_|06 it argues|_|03 that livestock|_|01 are more a contributor|_|03 to gas|_|02 emissions|_|05 in our atmosphere|_|05 then vehicle|_|03 emissions|_|05 . it spouts|_|01 some numbers|_|01 and facts|_|03 but i can see|_|01 straight|_|04 away|_|02 this is a fabricated|_|01 article|_|04 that is completely|_|01 biased|_|02 . this is the crap|_|01 we need|_|01 to take|_|06 out of our news|_|04 .
i am so moved|_|15 and jealous|_|02 really|_|01 of the people|_|03 of south|_|01 korea|_|01 . for them to protest|_|03 there president|_|02 , who is totally|_|01 wrong|_|01 for all she did , is something to be admired|_|02 . i love|_|01 the spirit|_|02 of the people|_|03 to not stop|_|18 until she leaves|_|03 office|_|04 . if only it was that easy|_|03 for us|_|01 americans|_|03 to do the same with trump|_|02 .
i just read|_|03 this article|_|04 about trees|_|03 dying|_|09 across|_|02 the country|_|04 and i ca|_|01 n't understand|_|03 why more people|_|01 are n't concerned|_|02 about this . if we lose|_|07 our trees|_|03 we lose|_|07 everything . it makes|_|02 me crazy|_|05 that people|_|01 are n't paying|_|05 attention|_|01 and could care|_|02 less|_|02 about the snowball|_|04 effect|_|02 that is happening|_|04 because of climate|_|02 change|_|09 . because of us|_|01 !
just when you think|_|02 things|_|08 could n't get|_|02 much|_|01 worse|_|09 ! i just ca|_|01 n't imagine|_|02 who in the world|_|03 would kill|_|07 , then mutilate|_|03 a baby|_|03 horse|_|02 ! it pretty|_|01 much|_|01 sounds|_|04 like|_|02 someone|_|01 with a mental|_|05 health|_|02 issue|_|01 is running|_|14 around|_|04 crazy|_|05 with a gun|_|02 . it is nice|_|01 to know|_|11 so many|_|01 nonprofits|_|01 are not only engaged|_|03 in finding|_|02 this criminal|_|03 , but also|_|02 to prevent|_|02 this from happening|_|02 again , i think|_|02 the adult|_|01 horses|_|02 were in better|_|13 shape|_|05 and that 's why they survived|_|02 . what kind|_|01 of lazy|_|01 loon|_|01 would mutilate|_|03 the little|_|08 horse|_|02 's genitals|_|01 ?
a moron|_|02 arkansas|_|02 cop|_|05 left|_|04 her police|_|01 dog|_|01 in the patrol|_|03 car|_|04 in the middle|_|04 of summer|_|02 and the poor|_|01 thing|_|08 died|_|04 . she 's on administrative|_|01 leave|_|02 while the incident|_|02 is being investigated|_|02 . what 's to investigate|_|02 ? the dog|_|01 did n't lock|_|02 itself in the car|_|04 . she should at least|_|01 be immediately|_|03 fired|_|01 for being too stupid|_|01 to be a cop|_|05 .
these people|_|01 were guests|_|08 who were presumably|_|01 staying|_|02 illegally|_|01 at this camp|_|02 . they were allowed|_|01 to stay|_|02 there out of compassion|_|02 , i 'm assuming|_|09 . then , when they 're told|_|02 that something else|_|03 has to be figured|_|01 out , they lose|_|01 it . when you give|_|40 a group|_|01 something , even|_|01 if it does n't belong|_|01 to them and even|_|01 if you 're being kind|_|01 my doing it , they immediately|_|03 feel|_|05 like|_|02 it belongs|_|01 to them and will react|_|01 strongly|_|01 if you try|_|01 to take|_|02 it away|_|04 .
too many|_|01 readily|_|01 . too many|_|01 readily|_|01 . too many|_|01 readily|_|01 . too many|_|01 readily|_|01 . too many|_|01 readily|_|01 . too many|_|01 readily|_|01 . too many|_|01 readily|_|01 . too many|_|01 readily|_|01 . too many|_|01 readily|_|01 . too many|_|01 readily|_|01 . too many|_|01 readily|_|01 . too many|_|01 readily|_|01 . too many|_|01 readily|_|01 . too many|_|01 readily|_|01 . too many|_|01 readily|_|01 . too many|_|01 readily|_|01 . too many|_|01 readily|_|01 . too many|_|01 readily|_|01 . too many|_|01 readily|_|01 . too many|_|01 readily|_|01 . too many|_|01 readily|_|01 . too many|_|01 readily|_|01 . too many|_|01 readily|_|01 . too many|_|01 readily|_|01 . too many|_|01 readily|_|01 . too many|_|01 readily|_|01 . too many|_|01 readily|_|01 . too many|_|01 readily|_|01 . too many|_|01 readily|_|01 . too many|_|01 readily|_|01 . too many|_|01 readily|_|01 .
this whole|_|02 article|_|04 is a little|_|01 sketchy|_|01 , it seems|_|02 like|_|02 they 're hiding|_|05 stuff|_|06 . this article|_|04 , if you want|_|01 to be really|_|01 cynical|_|01 and skeptical|_|01 , makes|_|42 it sound|_|02 like|_|02 the kids|_|02 might|_|01 be responsible|_|02 for the deaths|_|03 of the parents|_|02 . it seems|_|02 like|_|02 a pretty|_|01 vague|_|01 article|_|04 , i wish|_|02 we had more information|_|01 on this incident|_|02 .
i 'm not sure|_|02 how to feel|_|05 about this . we really|_|01 do need|_|03 to go|_|04 green|_|04 , but at what point|_|07 do we call|_|13 it green|_|04 when it kills|_|01 so many|_|01 animals|_|01 ? i 'm a little|_|01 aghast|_|01 , even|_|01 though|_|01 i know|_|05 science|_|02 needs|_|02 evidence|_|02 in numbers|_|04 , that they are wasting|_|10 money|_|01 on figuring|_|01 out that species|_|01 that typically|_|01 migrate|_|02 are * gasp|_|01 * being killed|_|01 in places|_|01 other than where they are from . put|_|01 that money|_|01 towards developing|_|15 something that stops|_|01 the problem|_|02 . we need|_|03 green|_|04 energy|_|06 like|_|02 wind|_|08 and solar|_|01 , so let|_|02 's find|_|05 a solution|_|02 to make|_|02 it so that we do n't keep|_|02 losing|_|01 what we 're trying|_|01 to save|_|09 .
i had no clue|_|02 oklahoma|_|01 was getting|_|01 so many|_|01 earthquakes|_|02 lately|_|01 . apparently|_|01 due|_|03 to the oil|_|01 companies|_|03 injecting|_|01 waste|_|05 it is triggering|_|04 a lot|_|05 more earthquakes|_|02 . they are n't massive|_|03 ones|_|02 , but still|_|03 5.0 is decent|_|06 . it caused|_|02 some damage|_|02 to buildings|_|07 and stuff|_|06 . people|_|02 even|_|03 at the oil|_|01 company|_|03 felt|_|03 it really|_|01 well|_|13 . it shook|_|09 everyone up a good|_|13 bit|_|04 . but its crazy|_|01 that its becoming|_|04 the norm|_|01 there ! so crazy|_|05 .
i hear|_|02 the british|_|01 government|_|02 is looking|_|02 to drill|_|02 for oil|_|01 again . this time|_|01 they are looking|_|02 to drill|_|02 near|_|01 the murchison falls|_|01 national|_|01 park|_|01 in uganda|_|01 . everyone is so dependent|_|01 on oil|_|01 all the time|_|01 . too bad|_|01 for some giraffes|_|01 that live|_|01 there as they will be displaced|_|02 . of course|_|09 i could really|_|01 care|_|02 less|_|02 about giraffes|_|01 5000 miles|_|01 away|_|02 from me . still|_|04 i wish|_|02 the giraffes|_|01 the best|_|03 i suppose|_|02 . brits|_|01 are such weasels|_|02 it figures|_|02 they would look|_|02 to kill|_|02 a bunch|_|02 of giraffes|_|01 for their own selfish|_|01 gains|_|02 . governments|_|02 all stink|_|01 .
i remember|_|01 where i was when the paris|_|04 attack|_|09 happened|_|01 . it was so terrible|_|02 how i felt|_|01 and how everyone around|_|04 the world|_|08 felt|_|01 . these terrible|_|02 people|_|01 are trying|_|01 to make|_|02 us|_|01 scared|_|01 to do things|_|07 we love|_|01 . but i wo nt|_|01 let|_|01 them win|_|01 . in so happy|_|04 the band|_|05 decided|_|01 to go|_|04 back|_|04 and give|_|09 a concert|_|01 . this has to be a statement|_|04 for us|_|01 all . fear|_|03 will never|_|02 win|_|01 !
this is what happens|_|03 when you take|_|01 in people|_|01 from an archaic|_|02 civilization|_|01 . all of these refugees|_|01 need|_|01 to be throw|_|01 back|_|06 into their mud|_|02 pit|_|06 . their religion|_|02 embraces|_|02 hatred|_|01 . let|_|01 them figure|_|01 out how to live|_|02 in peace|_|02 in their own countries|_|02 , then we can allow|_|01 them into civilized|_|03 world|_|08 . is it is now , i think|_|01 all of europe|_|01 is doomed|_|01 .
hey . i 'm not sure|_|07 if you have ever|_|01 considered|_|05 getting|_|02 yourself screened|_|01 for colon|_|01 cancer|_|05 . from what i have read|_|03 , the prep|_|01 for this screening|_|01 seems|_|02 quite|_|03 unpleasant|_|01 . drinking|_|05 massive|_|04 amounts|_|02 of a questionable|_|01 substance|_|07 heavy|_|02 with salt|_|02 does n't seem|_|02 to be like|_|02 a good|_|13 time|_|02 to me . i noticed|_|04 that some items|_|01 from a company|_|03 have made|_|02 it to phase|_|02 two|_|01 trials|_|04 through the fda|_|01 . one|_|03 is a food|_|02 bar|_|02 and the other one|_|01 is a smoothie|_|02 . they are supposed|_|02 to have some kind|_|01 of flavors|_|03 to them like|_|02 strawberry|_|03 and lemon|_|04 . i guess|_|02 this should help|_|05 with the process|_|06 .
i really|_|01 do not understand|_|04 what has become|_|04 of our society|_|02 . have you heard|_|02 about the guy|_|03 who shot|_|03 several|_|03 people|_|01 at the shopping|_|02 mall?because of him , six|_|01 people|_|01 were injured|_|01 and three|_|02 dead|_|01 and some three|_|02 people|_|01 had eye|_|05 injuries|_|02 because of the broken|_|13 glasses|_|01 . the guy|_|03 is only 20|_|01 from turkey|_|05 and guess|_|01 what , he has been charged|_|03 with murder|_|01 because he confessed|_|03 .
that 's a really|_|01 strange|_|02 and messed|_|02 up situation|_|02 . it 's really|_|01 sad|_|02 for the children|_|04 involved|_|07 and it 's very troubling|_|02 that any country|_|04 could plan|_|03 out such an awful|_|01 attack|_|01 . i hope|_|03 that things|_|08 change|_|01 in those areas|_|06 of the world|_|03 and more security|_|02 is put|_|01 in place|_|01 so these types|_|01 of attacks|_|01 can be detected|_|01 and negated|_|02 .
check|_|10 out this article|_|04 about the erika virus|_|03 . i did not know|_|01 that there was so much|_|01 going|_|01 on with it , or that it spread|_|02 so much|_|01 . i also|_|02 did not know|_|01 that it can spread|_|02 through the ways|_|11 they described|_|02 in the article|_|04 , like|_|02 sex|_|04 . definitely|_|01 information|_|05 we need|_|02 to know|_|01 make|_|01 sure|_|07 to read|_|03 up on this and be careful|_|01 !
there should be a class|_|03 action|_|01 lawsuit|_|01 against the company|_|03 putting|_|07 out dangerous|_|01 products|_|05 . they are liable|_|02 for any injuries|_|04 they have caused|_|01 . people|_|01 should be given|_|01 restitution|_|01 for the damages|_|02 they have suffered|_|09 . i am glad|_|01 kyle is speaking|_|01 out against this and hopefully|_|02 she can prevent|_|02 further injuries|_|04 to unsuspecting|_|02 consumers|_|01 .
oh|_|01 my gosh ! can you even|_|03 imagine|_|02 this ? thinking|_|01 of citizens|_|01 being torn|_|05 from their homes|_|09 , tortured|_|02 , frightened|_|01 ! how could they just blatantly|_|01 violate|_|01 people|_|01 in this way|_|01 ? i suppose|_|02 it is hopeful|_|01 that we might|_|01 learn|_|01 from this , correct|_|03 mistakes|_|02 , but that does n't mitigate|_|02 the harm|_|01 that was done ! it also|_|02 does n't bode|_|01 well|_|03 that protecting|_|02 the victims|_|02 now , after the fact|_|04 , also|_|02 seems|_|04 to be in question|_|06 . the assumption|_|03 that they were informed|_|01 of the release|_|03 of the data|_|01 , i think|_|02 , is reckless|_|02 . verification|_|01 that the already|_|01 suffering|_|03 victims|_|02 wo n't be further victimized|_|01 is as important|_|01 as the far|_|02 reaching|_|03 implications|_|02 of the data|_|01 itself ! i wonder|_|02 why there is no mention|_|03 of the ramifications|_|04 to the department|_|03 either|_|01 . just releasing|_|01 the data|_|01 is great|_|02 , but what about investigations|_|01 and punishments|_|01 ?
a mother|_|05 pushed|_|11 a stroller|_|01 onto an elevator|_|02 that was not there . the baby|_|01 dies|_|01 of injuries|_|04 and the mother|_|05 was hurt|_|02 . the building|_|01 had over 100|_|01 elevator|_|02 violations|_|02 but did not stay|_|02 on top|_|08 of things|_|10 to make|_|03 sure|_|04 the elevators|_|02 were working|_|09 properly|_|01 . the building|_|01 negligence|_|02 caused|_|02 an infants|_|01 death|_|04 . i ca|_|01 nt|_|01 imagine|_|01 going|_|01 through something like|_|02 that , that poor|_|01 mother|_|05 .
damaging|_|01 the amazon|_|02 rain|_|03 forest|_|02 , one|_|06 of the most iconic|_|01 and well|_|03 - known|_|01 rain|_|03 forests|_|02 known|_|01 to man|_|10 , just to get|_|02 oil|_|01 is simply|_|04 inexcusable|_|02 . the us|_|01 's hunt|_|01 for crude|_|01 oil|_|01 is coming|_|04 with disastrous|_|06 consequences|_|03 and needs|_|02 to be rectified|_|02 . by tearing|_|03 down the amazon|_|02 trees|_|01 , hurtful|_|01 greenhouse|_|01 gases|_|02 are rising|_|01 into the air|_|01 , damaging|_|01 the air|_|01 quality|_|05 around|_|04 us|_|01 . corporations|_|07 should n't be able|_|04 to hurt|_|02 the environment|_|02 like|_|01 this . it makes|_|02 me angry|_|03 .
" hey , i just read|_|03 an article|_|02 written|_|05 by a snowflake|_|01 that is melting|_|09 under man|_|01 made|_|03 " " global|_|01 warming|_|09 " " . one|_|06 thing|_|12 i have never|_|02 understood|_|03 is how the communist|_|02 party|_|05 took|_|27 over the environmental|_|02 movement|_|06 without a shot|_|01 . remember|_|01 when we found|_|04 out the founder|_|03 of ' green|_|02 peace|_|05 ' left|_|05 after discovering|_|02 the flood|_|02 of communist|_|02 and socialist|_|01 coming|_|04 into academia|_|01 and the organization|_|06 he started|_|10 ? i wish|_|02 someone|_|01 would actually|_|02 do some research|_|01 instead|_|01 of repeating|_|05 the same old|_|01 stuff|_|03 . "

things|_|08 seem|_|04 to be quite|_|04 bad|_|09 in yemen|_|01 . i ca|_|01 n't believe|_|01 is not only the united|_|01 states|_|01 conducting|_|01 drone|_|01 operations|_|05 or military|_|03 operations|_|05 for that matter|_|02 in yemen|_|01 . saudi|_|01 arabia|_|01 and qatar|_|02 are also|_|02 in it . things|_|08 must|_|01 be very bad|_|09 over there . i have little|_|01 background|_|02 about the issue|_|02 in yemen|_|01 , i wonder|_|02 what it is that saudi|_|01 arabia|_|01 and qatar|_|02 have to gain|_|01 here ?
hi|_|01 can you believe|_|01 this ? we have to be very careful|_|04 with this . you never|_|02 know|_|01 what kind|_|01 of damage|_|02 you can receive|_|02 in your eyes|_|05 from having these infections|_|03 . i would never|_|02 want|_|01 to this to happen|_|04 to me or my daughter|_|01 . i will have to really|_|01 take|_|02 care|_|02 of my our lenses|_|04 from now and on to prevent|_|01 any damage|_|02 .
it 's such a shame|_|02 the man|_|08 had to shoot|_|03 the dog|_|01 . labradors|_|01 in general|_|05 are decent|_|03 dogs|_|01 and not know|_|05 to attack|_|05 people|_|01 for no reason|_|02 . he could have shot|_|03 into the ground|_|01 or into the air|_|01 to scare|_|01 the dog|_|01 off . i feel|_|05 bad|_|01 for the lady|_|03 that lost|_|06 her dog|_|01 but this is why you keep|_|02 your dogs|_|01 on leashes|_|01 . if she had n't let|_|02 the dog|_|01 off the leash|_|01 this probably|_|01 would not have happened|_|01 . it 's a terrible|_|01 and unfortunate|_|03 situation|_|02 all around|_|04 and i hope|_|03 i never|_|02 find|_|05 myself with the same problem|_|01 . i 'm gon na|_|01 go|_|03 play|_|03 with my dog|_|01 now and be grateful|_|01 .
hey , take|_|29 a look|_|03 at this . lots|_|05 of conflicting|_|02 information|_|02 here , but it 'd be awesome|_|02 if there 's any truth|_|03 in this story|_|01 . i hate|_|01 to see|_|02 when animals|_|01 are in horrible|_|03 conditions|_|01 like|_|05 that , though|_|01 of course|_|04 peat|_|01 always|_|04 goes|_|02 way|_|05 too far|_|05 with their involvement|_|02 . maybe|_|01 that 's why i 'm not sure|_|07 what 's true|_|01 and what 's not in this article|_|04 ?
this article|_|02 i just read|_|06 is pretty|_|02 disturbing|_|11 . it 's about a guy|_|03 who was trying|_|01 to warm|_|01 up inside|_|01 a hot|_|11 spring|_|04 that fell|_|08 into one|_|02 that was way|_|12 too hot|_|11 , and was basically|_|01 boiled|_|01 alive|_|01 . it 's sad|_|02 , and apparently|_|01 one|_|05 of the people|_|03 with him caught|_|19 it on camera|_|01 . the really|_|01 disturbing|_|11 part|_|01 comes|_|04 when the authorities|_|07 could n't get|_|08 to the body|_|01 because of how hot|_|11 it was , and when they came|_|04 back|_|06 , they discovered|_|02 that it had dissolved|_|09 completely|_|01 . that part|_|01 creeper|_|03 me out .
this article|_|04 highlights|_|02 the fact|_|03 that we might|_|01 be going|_|01 on about our lives|_|03 , secure|_|02 in the knowledge|_|01 that everything is fine|_|01 , but then suddenly|_|01 when you least|_|01 expect|_|01 it , we are reminded|_|01 of our own mortality|_|01 . it makes|_|01 me want|_|05 to live|_|01 each and every|_|02 day|_|01 as well|_|07 as i can , because i never|_|01 know|_|01 if it might|_|01 be my last|_|02 . sometimes|_|01 we think|_|01 we have forever|_|02 , but this article|_|04 is a reminder|_|02 that each day|_|01 we live|_|01 on this earth|_|01 , imperfect|_|02 though|_|01 it may|_|01 be , is a gift|_|01 .
these people|_|03 are dumb|_|04 for voting|_|04 for him . they ca|_|01 n't even|_|01 tell|_|07 that he 's exploiting|_|01 their feelings|_|02 and has no intentions|_|01 to helping|_|01 them . he 's just taking|_|08 advantage|_|01 of the situation|_|02 for his|_|01 own gain|_|02 . they 'll find|_|01 out soon|_|01 and they 'll be the ones|_|02 who end|_|04 up suffering|_|11 most from this . i do n't really|_|01 have too much|_|01 sympathy|_|03 for them .
it seems|_|02 like|_|04 paris|_|02 is getting|_|01 to be a very dangerous|_|02 place|_|01 . i know|_|05 who guardianship|_|02 is , but i have never|_|02 heard|_|02 of this sheratan . it sounds|_|02 like|_|04 she is par|_|01 for the course|_|04 in hollywood|_|02 , just another|_|01 obama and hillary|_|01 supporter|_|01 . but still|_|01 , its terrible|_|01 to be tear|_|05 gassed|_|01 and beaten|_|02 , and i feel|_|05 sorry|_|01 for her .

all of this unrest|_|02 in the middle|_|04 east|_|03 makes|_|02 me afraid|_|02 to ever|_|03 leave|_|03 north|_|02 america|_|01 . i 'm glad|_|01 that it turned|_|10 out that the shooter|_|02 was mentally|_|01 unstable|_|05 instead|_|01 of being involved|_|07 in a larger|_|11 plot|_|04 . i wish|_|03 i had some answers|_|05 that could make|_|02 all this war|_|04 easier|_|03 but i just do n't understand|_|02 why everyone ca|_|01 n't just get|_|02 along|_|03 .
this article|_|03 was very interesting|_|06 but also|_|02 written|_|07 a little|_|01 strange|_|01 . it was about a wolf|_|01 who had wondered|_|02 off from the pack|_|06 . the wolf|_|01 was a protected|_|02 wolf|_|01 part|_|03 of a group|_|02 being protected|_|02 by some biological|_|01 organization|_|06 . had a tracking|_|07 monitor|_|03 on him and his|_|01 life|_|01 was largely|_|01 documented|_|02 . i guess|_|02 he wondered|_|02 from the pack|_|06 looking|_|02 to mate|_|03 . well|_|05 the government|_|01 , federal|_|01 government|_|01 , killed|_|14 the wolf|_|01 by a sniper|_|01 person|_|01 and its caused|_|02 a big|_|01 uproar|_|01 . kind|_|01 of weird|_|01 but i guess|_|02 that is a thing|_|12 .

i just read|_|03 a very sad|_|01 article|_|04 on the elderly|_|01 that are stuck|_|11 in aleppo|_|01 , syria|_|01 due|_|03 to the war|_|04 there . apparently|_|01 , 200,000 people|_|01 are unable|_|02 to get|_|01 out due|_|03 to the government|_|02 's siege|_|01 of the area|_|01 . there is a decreased|_|01 access|_|04 to food|_|03 and resources|_|02 for long|_|01 term|_|06 medical|_|02 conditions|_|07 are scarce|_|01 . the elderly|_|01 are having to sacrifice|_|01 their well|_|05 - being for the well|_|05 - being of their children|_|03 and grandchildren|_|01 . the war|_|04 needs|_|01 to come|_|04 to an end|_|10 soon|_|01 , before there is more suffering|_|05 by the people|_|01 of syria|_|01 .
what an alarming|_|02 statistic|_|01 ! i had no idea|_|03 that such things|_|08 even|_|01 existed|_|02 ! while it 's true|_|12 that this seems|_|02 to be much|_|04 more of a problem|_|01 in russia|_|04 than in the us|_|01 , since it 's on the internet|_|01 it is still|_|04 something that could potentially|_|01 be accessed|_|02 by our kids|_|01 ! teenagers|_|01 have enough|_|01 to deal|_|03 with without having to worry|_|06 about being prodded|_|02 into doing something horrible|_|03 like|_|02 committing|_|01 suicide|_|01 by these online|_|03 idiots|_|01 ! i remember|_|01 being a teenager|_|01 and how hard|_|01 it was , but i did n't have to deal|_|03 with this ! this is completely|_|01 awful|_|01 !
it 's ridiculous|_|03 that this day|_|01 in age|_|01 and for such an advanced|_|07 country|_|02 , we ca|_|01 n't even|_|03 get|_|18 water|_|06 right|_|01 . it should be a priority|_|02 that a basic|_|01 necessity|_|02 for life|_|01 be safe|_|02 . if we ca|_|01 n't do water|_|06 right|_|01 , how can we do anything else|_|03 right|_|01 ? it 's a freaking|_|01 joke|_|01 . our whole|_|01 governmental|_|01 system|_|08 is a mess|_|01 . and yet|_|01 , no one|_|01 does anything .
have i conveyed|_|04 my misanthropy|_|02 fully|_|01 yet|_|04 . read|_|06 this for a laugh|_|02 . this is what journalists|_|01 are doing . we have an orange|_|05 monkey|_|01 destroying|_|02 our nation|_|04 and people|_|01 spend|_|03 time|_|03 writing|_|10 about something as meaningless|_|01 as this . a guy|_|03 died|_|03 . terribly|_|01 sorry|_|01 . happens|_|01 thousands|_|01 and thousands|_|01 times|_|03 a day|_|01 . because this guy|_|03 was an idiot|_|01 it gets|_|01 written|_|10 up to feed|_|03 the idiotic|_|02 interests|_|01 of the sheep|_|03 .
this kind|_|01 of thing|_|05 happens|_|02 in north|_|04 korea|_|01 all the time|_|03 . the country|_|04 has so little|_|02 usable|_|02 farmland|_|01 , that any weather|_|01 disruption|_|03 is a major|_|08 problem|_|01 . this is what happened|_|02 during the arduous|_|03 march|_|03 in the 90s|_|01 , after kim il|_|01 sung|_|01 died|_|05 . the country|_|04 had a couple|_|04 bad|_|04 years|_|03 because of drought|_|02 and then flooding|_|02 , and suddenly|_|01 everyone was starving|_|02 .
as a parent|_|02 , i feel|_|13 that is definitely|_|01 one|_|06 of my responsibilities|_|01 to teach|_|02 my children|_|03 the importance|_|02 of loving|_|01 and taking|_|27 care|_|02 of our environment|_|02 . without the wilderness|_|04 , the animals|_|01 will have nowhere|_|01 to live|_|07 , and without the wilderness|_|04 , what will our animals|_|01 be forced|_|02 to live|_|07 in . what i want|_|01 them to remember|_|02 is that they are the ones|_|02 living|_|07 in the environment|_|02 , not the environment|_|02 invading|_|03 on our lives|_|03 . we must|_|01 take|_|27 care|_|02 of it in order|_|14 to make|_|27 sure|_|07 that we have a sustainable|_|01 environment|_|02 our children|_|03 's children|_|03 .
i thought|_|01 that this article|_|04 was something very hurtful|_|01 to read|_|06 . i was reading|_|06 about the fire|_|01 and what happened|_|03 to the place|_|01 that these people|_|03 live|_|02 and it said|_|01 that these people|_|03 got|_|14 hurt|_|05 and injured|_|05 and i felt|_|03 very bad|_|01 for them . i wish|_|02 that there was a way|_|06 that everyone could help|_|05 along|_|03 to . the people|_|03 should be more careful|_|05 about the fire|_|01 and see|_|10 the safety|_|02 next|_|02 time|_|02 .
i think|_|03 that rm may|_|01 weather|_|04 should have to pay|_|01 that money|_|03 back|_|03 if he still|_|04 has the reckless|_|02 or give|_|03 the reckless|_|02 back|_|03 to the store|_|02 with a price|_|02 tag|_|01 like|_|02 that the company|_|03 could really|_|01 need|_|03 that money|_|03 1.4 million|_|01 is a lot|_|05 of money|_|03 for a company|_|03 not to get|_|01 . also|_|02 we know|_|11 that he has the money|_|03 to pay|_|01 for the reckless|_|02 so mi|_|01 not sure|_|08 why he does n't just pay|_|01 the rest|_|01 of the balance|_|01 and not have to go|_|01 to court|_|11 and pay|_|01 all those fees|_|02 .
he said|_|01 it would not stop|_|04 him returning|_|01 to the field|_|03 to help|_|01 save|_|09 wildlife|_|01 . van|_|01 nicker|_|01 said|_|01 they were called|_|05 last|_|04 weekend|_|01 to assist|_|10 a ranger|_|01 who had caught|_|01 a poacher|_|03 near|_|01 sabin|_|02 river|_|01 . “ my colleagues|_|02 and i , with four|_|01 mozambican|_|02 police|_|01 officers|_|01 , were transporting|_|02 the poacher|_|03 to the station|_|01 , which was about 30|_|01 km|_|01 away|_|02 , when he escaped|_|01 from the vehicle|_|01 . i chased|_|01 after the poacher|_|03 and caught|_|01 him . i handed|_|05 him back|_|02 to the police|_|01 officer|_|01 . suddenly|_|01 , a mob|_|01 from the community|_|01 started|_|02 moving|_|01 towards us|_|01 , ” said|_|01 van|_|01 nicker|_|01 . the police|_|01 officers|_|01 who were with them ran|_|01 away|_|02 . “ we , the rangers|_|01 , were the targets|_|04 .
i was sad|_|02 to hear|_|02 that a woman|_|02 was critically|_|01 injured|_|01 sunday|_|02 evening|_|01 in a multiple|_|01 car|_|04 wreck|_|02 in the clinton|_|01 area|_|01 of prince|_|01 george|_|05 ’s county|_|01 . it seems|_|02 like|_|02 these things|_|09 are becoming|_|04 more common|_|06 . at least|_|01 the reporting|_|03 of such accidents|_|01 is more common|_|06 . people|_|01 should pay|_|05 more attention|_|01 to their driving|_|08 . i would n't be surprised|_|02 at all if someone|_|01 involved|_|05 was distracted|_|01 by cellphone|_|01 use|_|07 .
i find|_|05 this article|_|04 to be stupid|_|01 . it talks|_|01 about how trump|_|04 supporters|_|01 are attacking|_|01 actors|_|02 from the show|_|03 silicon|_|01 valley|_|01 . i 'm not a silicon|_|01 valley|_|01 fan|_|01 and i do not know|_|01 who those actors|_|02 are , but i believe|_|01 that if there were ever|_|03 to be a fight|_|05 that escalates|_|01 due|_|02 to differing|_|01 political|_|02 opinion|_|01 , i would just walk|_|10 up and leave|_|12 .
i find|_|01 that it is of a truth|_|05 , and am writing|_|08 to you regarding|_|05 this situation|_|02 that is erupting|_|08 in yemen|_|01 , that after the peace|_|04 talks|_|01 collapsed|_|01 security|_|01 and safety|_|02 for citizens|_|01 in these areas|_|01 has greatly|_|01 decreased|_|02 . i find|_|01 that how america|_|01 feels|_|11 about it , and others around|_|01 the world|_|01 , is more correct|_|01 , than in error|_|04 . whereby they are appalled|_|02 by all the violence|_|01 and blood|_|05 shed|_|04 . i feel|_|11 personally|_|05 that each party|_|01 should consider|_|01 the welfare|_|01 of the people|_|01 at large|_|01 , than any self|_|01 - aggrandizement|_|01 , and personal|_|01 power|_|01 plays|_|02 . it they can become|_|03 more self|_|01 - less|_|01 , and less|_|01 selfish|_|01 , they will make|_|43 decisions|_|01 that are in the best|_|03 interest|_|01 and safety|_|02 of the people|_|01 of yemen|_|01 , aside|_|05 and apart|_|05 of whatever|_|01 their political|_|02 ideologies|_|01 may|_|01 be , when they are saving|_|08 lives|_|02 , and not just garnering|_|01 votes|_|01 , or political|_|02 power|_|01
the article|_|04 was about corruption|_|05 at the international|_|01 monetary|_|01 fund|_|02 , specifically|_|01 the wrongdoing|_|02 of former|_|03 boss|_|01 rodrigo cato . the banking|_|02 industry|_|01 is rife|_|01 with issues|_|06 like|_|02 this , so it comes|_|04 as no surprise|_|03 that someone|_|01 was trying|_|05 to take|_|04 advantage|_|03 of the system|_|03 even|_|03 in an international|_|01 organization|_|03 like|_|02 the imf|_|01 . the problem|_|01 is that we do not have enough|_|02 prosecutors|_|01 that are willing|_|01 to take|_|04 on the banking|_|02 industry|_|01 and put|_|01 them in their place|_|01 . i 'm tired|_|02 of constantly|_|02 hearing|_|02 about people|_|01 getting|_|02 away|_|09 with white|_|05 collar|_|01 crimes|_|02 .
although this is bad|_|01 , i have to admit|_|04 that it 's also|_|02 rather|_|01 funny|_|02 . i do wonder|_|03 what caused|_|02 the squirrel|_|02 to go|_|01 on such a rampage|_|01 . perhaps|_|01 it felt|_|03 threatened|_|03 ? maybe|_|01 it was abused|_|03 ? perhaps|_|01 it got|_|01 caught|_|22 inside|_|01 and out of fear|_|03 did what animals|_|01 do - bite|_|03 and claw|_|01 their way|_|11 out . i 'm assuming|_|09 it was the latter|_|01 reason|_|02 and this just happened|_|01 to be an odd|_|01 situation|_|01 . i do n't think|_|02 it meant|_|04 to hurt|_|06 anyone , i think|_|02 it was just scared|_|01 and people|_|03 got|_|01 bit|_|02 because they got|_|01 in its way|_|11 . i ca|_|01 n't imagine|_|02 another|_|01 reason|_|02 than that . and the people|_|03 were fine|_|01 anyway|_|01 .
" male|_|02 models|_|09 are paid|_|05 a lot|_|05 less|_|03 than female|_|02 models|_|09 , which is interesting|_|01 considering|_|01 all of the news|_|01 lately|_|01 about a " " wage|_|01 gap|_|01 " " that some people|_|01 believe|_|01 exists|_|02 . each industry|_|01 has a different|_|01 set|_|05 of pay|_|01 and things|_|09 and that 's fine|_|04 , you have to look|_|02 at the individual|_|03 characteristics|_|01 when judging|_|02 whether something is wrong|_|03 . it 's very interesting|_|05 that this is starting|_|09 to change|_|03 though|_|01 , as male|_|02 products|_|04 become|_|02 a bigger|_|01 market|_|02 for companies|_|03 . "
isis|_|01 is now one|_|06 of the major|_|04 terrorists|_|01 group|_|01 operating|_|05 in iraq|_|01 . the iraqi|_|01 security|_|02 forces|_|04 are in constant|_|01 war|_|01 with it . isis|_|01 have killed|_|07 around|_|04 800 pol|_|02 in iraqi|_|01 city|_|01 of mosul|_|01 and using|_|04 1000s|_|01 of civilian|_|01 as human|_|03 shield|_|02 to stop|_|01 iraqi|_|01 forces|_|04 advance|_|03 and it make|_|18 me worried|_|02 that when it going|_|04 to stop|_|01 . we eliminate|_|01 one|_|06 group|_|01 and another|_|01 one|_|06 pop|_|01 up . this is a major|_|04 concern|_|04 for the world|_|08
i find|_|01 it interesting|_|01 to view|_|03 the lives|_|02 of primates|_|02 in order|_|13 to try|_|01 and understand|_|01 how it relates|_|05 to our own . the way|_|05 that the primates|_|02 dealt|_|01 with farsightedness|_|01 seemed|_|02 very practical|_|01 to me which shows|_|12 off their ingenuity|_|01 and ability|_|02 to problem|_|02 solve|_|01 . it makes|_|43 me wonder|_|03 if that 's where humans|_|02 get|_|02 their own ability|_|02 to problem|_|02 solve|_|01 as well|_|07 .
it 's amazing|_|01 what people|_|01 will do to avoid|_|01 embarrassment|_|01 . i just heard|_|01 about a guy|_|01 who was concerned|_|02 over urinary|_|02 track|_|09 issues|_|01 and decided|_|04 the best|_|03 way|_|09 to figure|_|01 out his|_|01 problem|_|01 was to shove|_|02 a stainless|_|01 steel|_|01 chopstick|_|01 into his|_|01 urethra|_|01 . it had to be removed|_|01 via surgery|_|02 , and it sounds|_|02 like|_|02 it was successful|_|01 , but jesus|_|01 christ|_|01 man|_|08 , go|_|02 to a doctor|_|01 .
yet|_|04 another|_|01 reason|_|02 to have more strict|_|03 immigration|_|02 rules|_|11 . these people|_|01 know|_|01 the dangers|_|02 that they face|_|01 when they do this , so it is hard|_|03 to feel|_|05 very sorry|_|01 for them . i do n't think|_|03 giving|_|09 them more information|_|05 on these dangers|_|02 will stop|_|18 them , but patrolling|_|01 the waters|_|01 and turning|_|01 these human|_|03 traffickers|_|01 back|_|06 will . if it is made|_|43 difficult|_|02 for these human|_|03 traffickers|_|01 to exploit|_|02 these people|_|01 , it will happen|_|01 less|_|02 often|_|05 .
i think|_|03 that it would a great|_|02 thing|_|08 if all students|_|01 could get|_|01 connected|_|08 to the internet|_|01 . the internet|_|01 will provide|_|06 them ways|_|11 to learn|_|08 more and it will help|_|01 them further|_|01 their education|_|03 as well|_|09 . i think|_|03 that president|_|02 obama 's plan|_|03 for the internet|_|01 should have really|_|01 worked|_|14 better|_|09 to so that all students|_|01 can have an opportunity|_|01 to use|_|01 computers|_|01 anytime that they want|_|05 to .
hello|_|01 friend|_|01 . i am really|_|01 very surprised|_|01 at all the things|_|12 that have happened|_|04 and continue|_|06 and continue|_|06 to happen|_|04 in the world|_|03 . now the big|_|01 problem|_|01 we are facing|_|02 in this part|_|03 of the united|_|01 states|_|01 of america|_|01 is a new|_|01 outbreak|_|01 or virus|_|03 . the specialists|_|01 in the field|_|03 of health|_|01 still|_|03 do not know|_|09 what this problem|_|01 is due|_|02 to and how to stop|_|03 it . here i write|_|07 part|_|03 of what i have learned|_|04 on the subject|_|02 . this started|_|10 in november|_|01 and the symptoms|_|01 are fever|_|01 , a lot|_|05 of chills|_|03 , and difficulty|_|03 to breathe|_|04
if he is not responsible|_|02 for the killings|_|02 , it would be baffling|_|01 as to why he would attack|_|05 the officers|_|01 . if it turns|_|10 out that he was responsible|_|02 for these killings|_|02 , it is good|_|01 that he can no longer|_|01 harm|_|01 anyone else|_|03 . it must|_|01 be a nerve|_|02 - wracking|_|01 job|_|01 to be a police|_|01 officer|_|01 , knowing|_|06 that at any moment|_|05 someone|_|01 could attack|_|05 you for no good|_|01 reason|_|03 .
this story|_|01 about the shooting|_|02 at the airport|_|01 is absolutely|_|01 breaking|_|02 my heart|_|01 . there is no reason|_|03 for these violent|_|02 gun|_|01 actions|_|01 to continue|_|02 to go|_|04 on . can you imagine|_|02 if this had been our dad|_|01 or other friend|_|05 or family|_|08 member|_|01 ? i can not imagine|_|02 what the victims|_|02 family|_|08 is going|_|04 through right|_|07 now . the poor|_|02 people|_|03 in the airport|_|01 must|_|01 have been in a frenzy|_|02 . it had to have been scary|_|01 to not know|_|01 what was going|_|04 on . especially|_|01 before everyone knew|_|01 the gunman|_|02 was dead|_|01 . this one|_|05 cowards|_|02 acts|_|01 caused|_|02 so much|_|01 turmoil|_|03 and upheaval|_|03 for so many|_|01 people|_|03 . can you imagine|_|02 all of the money|_|03 that was wasted|_|10 because of his|_|01 stupid|_|01 choices|_|02 . between flights|_|01 being canceled|_|01 , rearranged|_|01 , police|_|01 officers|_|01 time|_|04 . i wish|_|01 we could understand|_|01 what he was thinking|_|05 and why he did this mess|_|02 .
it looks|_|02 like|_|02 chaos|_|03 in iraq|_|01 . the islamic|_|01 state|_|02 ( is ) has taken|_|29 over mosul|_|01 and people|_|01 are getting|_|03 the hell|_|06 out of there . the problem|_|01 is , there is nowhere|_|01 to go|_|01 . there are a few camps|_|08 for refugees|_|01 but not nearly|_|07 enough|_|01 space|_|08 . people|_|01 are even|_|03 taking|_|29 there sheep|_|03 which ca|_|01 n’t be helpful|_|01 … the is has had people|_|01 under their rule|_|11 for almost|_|07 3|_|01 years|_|03 and the people|_|01 are making|_|02 a run|_|16 from it . no doubt|_|01 they have every|_|02 reason|_|02 – the young|_|01 women|_|01 and girls|_|02 feel|_|04 veil|_|05 - less|_|01 freedom|_|01 ! the is leader|_|01 au|_|03 baker|_|02 al|_|01 - baghdadi . the were right|_|02 to leave|_|03 as the city|_|03 is now a war|_|02 zone|_|04 with iraqi|_|01 security|_|03 forces|_|04 retaking|_|03 the city|_|03 . it is a bitter|_|02 fight|_|01 with the usual|_|01 “ blood|_|05 will spill|_|04 ” messages|_|02 rampant|_|03 . many|_|01 families|_|08 are leaving|_|03 and there are some really|_|01 heart|_|01 - wrenching|_|03 tales|_|01 . so sad|_|02 … many|_|01 are in fear|_|03 .
there are too many|_|01 police|_|01 shootings|_|02 . however|_|02 , being in the police|_|01 is not an easy|_|01 job|_|02 . too many|_|01 people|_|03 are in a rush|_|04 to judgment|_|01 . if cities|_|03 would be more forthright|_|03 and transparent|_|04 it would help|_|05 . why people|_|03 feel|_|01 that violence|_|03 and looting|_|01 is a valid|_|02 method|_|01 of protest|_|01 is beyond|_|03 me . i have great|_|03 sympathy|_|03 for the police|_|01 .
this is so sad|_|01 guys|_|03 . :( i ca|_|01 n't believe|_|03 this , i never|_|02 knew|_|04 how far|_|03 reaching|_|06 climate|_|02 change|_|09 actually|_|04 was . these poor|_|02 turtles|_|01 are dying|_|04 because of the temperature|_|02 changes|_|09 . please|_|03 do something , write|_|04 your local|_|03 senator|_|01 so we can start|_|08 to reverse|_|05 this . we need|_|02 to get|_|02 back|_|05 into the climate|_|02 accords|_|01 and become|_|04 a leader|_|01 in environmental|_|02 sustainability|_|01 , instead|_|01 of what we have been doing .
the real|_|01 problem|_|01 with people|_|03 born|_|06 with critical|_|04 illness|_|01 is that we try|_|01 so hard|_|01 to give|_|33 them a normal|_|01 life|_|02 . however|_|01 these people|_|03 are not normal|_|01 . and to force|_|02 them into feeling|_|06 normal|_|01 while a nice|_|04 sentiment|_|01 , is hardly|_|02 productive|_|01 . instead|_|01 we should focus|_|05 on how these people|_|03 can live|_|05 differently|_|01 than trying|_|01 to merge|_|06 them into general|_|02 society|_|02 . society|_|02 it 's self|_|02 is a disgusting|_|02 community|_|01 of work|_|02 till|_|01 you die|_|05 . no matter|_|06 what it is you chose|_|03 to do . take|_|06 autism|_|01 for example|_|04 , we try|_|01 so hard|_|01 to normalize|_|01 them . however|_|01 with my experience|_|02 these people|_|03 are brilliant|_|03 in their own ways|_|11 that we ca|_|01 n't understand|_|02 . they see|_|02 things|_|11 in an alien|_|01 like|_|02 manor|_|02 of ultra|_|01 basic|_|04 instinct|_|01 . this instinct|_|01 should have it 's own way|_|11 of flourishing|_|02 instead|_|01 of bowing|_|06 down to the rest|_|02 of us|_|01 .
the whole|_|02 situation|_|01 with iraq|_|01 and the uprising|_|01 of isis|_|01 can be attributed|_|08 to the u.s.|_|01 war|_|04 on terror|_|04 and failed|_|04 attempts|_|05 at establishing|_|01 democracy|_|01 in the middle|_|03 east|_|03 . the truth|_|02 of the matter|_|01 is , the g.w. bush|_|05 administration|_|06 had no idea|_|03 what they were doing when they decided|_|01 to invade|_|04 iraq|_|01 under the pretense|_|01 of ridding|_|01 saddam|_|01 hussein|_|01 of weapons|_|02 of mass|_|05 destruction|_|06 : iraq|_|01 had none|_|02 , and we destroyed|_|04 the iraqi|_|01 way|_|01 of life|_|07 over this lie|_|01 . iraqis|_|01 may|_|01 have suffered|_|10 under saddam|_|01 hussein|_|01 , but at the very least|_|01 , the region|_|03 was stable|_|03 and extremists|_|01 were rare|_|06 . after the american|_|02 invasion|_|01 , civilian|_|01 deaths|_|06 likely|_|01 skyrocketed|_|01 because law|_|01 and order|_|03 were thrown|_|01 out as well|_|03 .
our system|_|04 has failed|_|11 us|_|01 once again and continues|_|02 to fail|_|11 us|_|01 daily|_|01 . the idea|_|06 that a foster|_|01 care|_|01 system|_|04 allows|_|01 for brothers|_|01 to be split|_|02 apart|_|05 that came|_|04 in together|_|05 in insane|_|01 . it 's strange|_|02 to me that we treat|_|03 human|_|03 life|_|03 as if it is less|_|02 than important|_|01 . i wish|_|02 that people|_|01 would wake|_|04 up from the old|_|07 - world|_|08 ideals|_|01 and behavior|_|01 . thanks|_|02 to the 20ht century|_|01 and the advent|_|01 of film|_|02 as a story|_|02 - telling|_|01 mechanic|_|01 , we have the ability|_|01 to be able|_|03 to share|_|01 stories|_|02 with each other on a bigger|_|02 level|_|02 . i ca|_|01 n't believe|_|01 that it 's 2018 and we still|_|04 operate|_|01 as if it 's 1400 a.d . i am disgusted|_|02 by our modern|_|05 culture|_|06 and our governmental|_|01 system|_|04 . it 's all a sham|_|01 . we are slaves|_|03 .
this article|_|04 was really|_|01 inspiring|_|02 . the woman|_|02 in it goes|_|01 through so much|_|01 but she still|_|01 tries|_|06 to persevere|_|01 . i think|_|02 it is admirable|_|02 to not give|_|01 up in the face|_|02 of such obstacles|_|02 . but i imagine|_|02 it was really|_|01 difficult|_|01 for her to do ! imagine|_|02 being in pain|_|02 like|_|02 that ... it 's horrifying|_|02 . what do you think|_|02 of this article|_|04 ? is n't it inspiring|_|02 ?
hey i know|_|10 you are busy|_|01 but i wanted|_|01 to share|_|01 something that is laying|_|01 heavy|_|23 on my heart|_|01 . the nigerian|_|02 paper|_|01 is reporting|_|04 of mass|_|03 rape|_|03 done by the government|_|02 . women|_|02 and children|_|04 were raped|_|07 by policemen|_|01 , soldiers|_|01 , camp|_|08 leaders|_|01 and vigilante|_|01 groups|_|01 . this makes|_|08 my blood|_|05 boil|_|01 . how does this make|_|08 you feel|_|08 ? what can we do ?

this must|_|01 be terrifying|_|01 to have people|_|03 come|_|16 into your town|_|02 , drag|_|02 you from your home|_|01 , and to watch|_|06 while those you love|_|01 are taken|_|04 or shot|_|03 , really|_|01 it must|_|01 be unbearable|_|01 , even|_|03 as you endure|_|03 it . we get|_|01 upset|_|01 when we hear|_|02 news|_|01 of one|_|03 or two|_|01 people|_|03 being kidnapped|_|01 or suffering|_|09 this kind|_|01 of trauma|_|02 , yet|_|03 here we 're talking|_|02 about much|_|05 more . it must|_|01 be heartbreaking|_|02 for them .
this article|_|04 is very , very , eye|_|05 - opening|_|04 and interesting|_|05 to read|_|03 about the the seven|_|01 biggest|_|01 threats|_|03 that president|_|02 trump|_|02 poses|_|01 to the environment|_|02 . i think|_|06 with president|_|02 trump|_|02 backing|_|01 out of the paris|_|04 agreement|_|06 and not really|_|01 focusing|_|02 a little|_|03 bit|_|02 of more efforts|_|01 on global|_|01 warming|_|02 , there can be a big|_|01 problem|_|01 in the future|_|03 .
this feels|_|06 so typical|_|01 . the burden|_|04 of safe|_|02 sex|_|03 has fallen|_|26 to the woman|_|02 for decades|_|01 , ever|_|03 since the oral|_|01 contraceptive|_|01 was introduced|_|03 . women|_|02 frequently|_|01 have to decide|_|03 between accepting|_|20 disturbing|_|11 side|_|01 effects|_|02 or accepting|_|20 the risk|_|04 of pregnancy|_|01 , whereas men|_|01 have never|_|01 had to make|_|01 that choice|_|02 . there will never|_|01 be true|_|08 equality|_|02 until men|_|01 and women|_|02 face|_|02 the risks|_|04 and consequences|_|03 of sex|_|03 equally|_|01 .
wow|_|01 ! i did;t know|_|03 tigers|_|02 were in such trouble|_|02 ! this makes|_|08 me want|_|01 to do more research|_|01 and donate|_|01 to the national|_|01 tiger|_|02 conservation|_|03 authority|_|02 . we must|_|01 protect|_|02 these animals|_|01 ! it is so disturbing|_|01 that poaching|_|02 is still|_|04 so problematic|_|01 in today|_|02 's society|_|02 . i have heard|_|02 of poaching|_|02 of other animals|_|01 , but rarely|_|01 about tigers|_|02 . i hope|_|02 something can be done , and soon|_|01 , to help|_|05 tigers|_|02 .
i have never|_|02 heard|_|02 of sleep|_|01 paralysis|_|01 but it does n't sound|_|01 like|_|02 a particularly|_|01 dangerous|_|02 disorder|_|01 . we all undergo|_|01 a state|_|02 of unconsciousness|_|01 during sleep|_|01 where we dream|_|02 and can not control|_|10 certain|_|01 things|_|09 in the dream|_|01 . but this seems|_|02 to be an extension|_|01 of dreaming|_|02 where your brain|_|01 becomes|_|01 out of sync|_|01 with your body|_|09 . i suspect|_|03 this may|_|01 something to do with stress|_|01 and mental|_|05 health|_|02 problems|_|01
this story|_|03 i have read|_|03 was heart|_|01 breaking|_|40 ! two|_|01 men|_|01 were shot|_|17 , one|_|01 twice|_|01 in the stomach|_|04 and the other shot|_|01 in the back|_|01 . sadly|_|02 no weapons|_|01 were recovered|_|01 and no arrests|_|04 were made|_|03 causing|_|02 me to worry|_|06 the person|_|01 that did this is free|_|03 . this upsets|_|02 me worried|_|01 for myself and others , hoping|_|02 to protect|_|01 the community|_|03 from the criminal|_|02 gun|_|02 man|_|01 still|_|04 at large|_|06 . the two|_|01 men|_|01 were taken|_|01 to the hospital|_|02 , hoping|_|02 for a speedy|_|01 recovery|_|03 for them and comfort|_|01 for their families|_|01 after this tragic|_|01 incident|_|02 ! the terrible|_|01 time|_|06 they must|_|01 all be going|_|01 through now . worrying|_|06 and stressing|_|07 over this unthinkable|_|01 situation|_|02 . i sure|_|07 do hope|_|02 the person|_|01 responsible|_|02 is found|_|01 and arrested|_|01 quickly|_|01 , to keep|_|04 our community|_|03 safe|_|01 from additional|_|03 attacks|_|05 and to to get|_|01 him the help|_|01 he needs|_|01 . not to mention|_|01 time|_|06 in prison|_|02 . certainly|_|01 right|_|04
it 's a weird|_|01 ironic|_|02 twist|_|13 that once illegal|_|01 animals|_|01 are seized|_|01 they may|_|01 fare|_|04 worse|_|14 than if the smugglers|_|01 were allowed|_|01 to get|_|04 away|_|01 with them . it brings|_|04 out the selfishness|_|01 of humans|_|02 and their inability|_|02 to share|_|02 this wonderful|_|02 world|_|08 with its other inhabitants|_|01 . these animals|_|01 should be properly|_|01 cared|_|02 for , and perhaps|_|01 some of the financing|_|01 could come|_|04 from fines|_|01 imposed|_|01 upon the people|_|01 who illegally|_|01 absconded|_|01 with them in the first|_|05 place|_|01 .
i think|_|06 that this is a kind|_|01 of funny|_|02 story|_|02 . i enjoy|_|04 hearing|_|02 about escaped|_|01 animals|_|01 from the zoo|_|02 for some reason|_|06 . if you think|_|06 about it the zoo|_|02 is just one|_|03 big|_|01 animal|_|01 jail|_|01 . i am sure|_|07 that i would resent|_|01 the fact|_|03 of being locked|_|02 up if i was a wild|_|01 animal|_|01 . some of these animals|_|01 have never|_|02 known|_|11 the difference|_|03 .
it seems|_|02 pretty|_|01 suspicious|_|01 to me that a machine|_|02 that was off could just turn|_|10 itself back|_|03 on . i 'm sure|_|06 somebody|_|01 either|_|01 accidentally|_|01 turned|_|10 it on or do it on purpose|_|01 . that sounds|_|02 like|_|02 a really|_|01 awful|_|02 way|_|02 to go|_|03 though|_|01 being crushed|_|01 like|_|02 that . they better|_|01 come|_|04 up with some better|_|17 safety|_|01 requirements|_|02 to make|_|01 sure|_|06 that does n't happen|_|01 to anybody ever|_|03 again .
i remember|_|01 how hard|_|03 i was to my mother|_|01 especially|_|01 in my teens|_|01 . it can be rough|_|04 and now i see|_|01 that instead|_|01 of how it use|_|01 to be . as a kid|_|01 you always|_|04 think|_|01 that you know|_|11 what is best|_|02 that you are number|_|07 one|_|04 . you do n't really|_|01 think|_|01 about other people|_|03 and their feelings|_|02 and you tend|_|02 to rebel|_|02 and just be this horrible|_|03 version|_|02 of yourself .
" looks|_|02 like|_|04 a lot|_|05 of muslim|_|01 hate|_|01 crimes|_|02 are going|_|01 on , especially|_|01 in new|_|06 york|_|01 city|_|03 . a lady|_|03 had her clothes|_|01 set|_|12 on fire|_|08 right|_|01 in public|_|02 . people|_|01 yelling|_|02 " " get|_|02 out of america|_|01 " " at them , etc . i can understand|_|01 people|_|01 's animosity|_|01 towards them as their religious|_|04 people|_|01 essentially|_|01 declared|_|02 war|_|04 on us|_|01 , but not everyone is that extreme|_|01 . "
i wonder|_|01 if i recognize|_|02 this guy|_|03 . i have n't heard|_|02 of him up until now . he was just a little|_|02 before our time|_|02 , although i 'm sure|_|02 he had an impact|_|01 on many|_|01 of the people|_|03 we know|_|01 . it seems|_|02 like|_|02 he influenced|_|01 many|_|01 other comedians|_|02 that i know|_|01 . i plan|_|03 on looking|_|02 up his|_|01 work|_|02 to see|_|05 what is out there of him .
the article|_|04 i read|_|06 was about the disparity|_|01 in responsibility|_|02 for birth|_|01 control|_|02 between men|_|01 and women|_|02 . a new|_|12 male|_|03 birth|_|01 control|_|02 was rejected|_|02 as having too many|_|01 side|_|01 effects|_|02 on men|_|01 , when options|_|02 available|_|01 to women|_|02 have far|_|01 more and more severe|_|06 side|_|09 effects|_|02 . the article|_|04 mentioned|_|01 that birth|_|01 control|_|02 for women|_|02 revolutionized|_|03 lives|_|06 so much|_|04 that the side|_|09 effects|_|02 were deemed|_|01 acceptable|_|02 , but men|_|01 are not accustomed|_|02 to ceding|_|02 convenience|_|01 for responsibility|_|02 , are used|_|01 to women|_|02 taking|_|35 control|_|02 in this area|_|01 .
i was reading|_|03 about a dad|_|01 who lost|_|01 his|_|01 daughter|_|01 in the charlie headboard|_|01 attacks|_|07 in paris|_|04 . it was touching|_|07 . i mean|_|01 , it was dark|_|02 , him talking|_|02 about losing|_|01 her and those feeling|_|01 , as well|_|12 as those of other people|_|01 who lived|_|01 it . but his|_|01 story|_|01 touched|_|07 me . he was talking|_|02 about all the notes|_|01 he received|_|13 and how there was such an outpouring|_|06 . he wrote|_|03 a book|_|01 , and he 's healing|_|02 . nice|_|04 to see|_|15 theirs some form|_|02 of recovery|_|03 after something so awful|_|01
micheal moore|_|06 was right|_|12 about this . trump|_|02 could and did win|_|05 . the more we dismissed|_|11 him the stronger|_|07 he got|_|02 . i ca|_|01 n't stand|_|04 his|_|01 attitude|_|03 and his|_|01 lack|_|01 of compassion|_|02 . but i can understand|_|02 how he won|_|05 . voters|_|01 were fed|_|01 up with the traditional|_|02 lifetime|_|05 politicians|_|03 . i think|_|02 hillary|_|01 lost|_|08 the election|_|04 more than trump|_|02 won|_|05 it . a lot|_|05 of people|_|01 did n't trust|_|06 her and wanted|_|05 a change|_|09 . now good|_|12 or bad|_|09 we have change|_|01 .
megan kelly|_|03 during an interview|_|01 , repeatedly|_|01 shaking|_|07 his|_|01 finger|_|02 at her and accusing|_|01 her of being “ fascinated|_|01 with sex|_|01 ” because she brought|_|11 up allegations|_|02 of sexual|_|02 assault|_|03 against trump|_|02 . in a scolding|_|01 tone|_|02 , gingrich tried|_|01 to tell|_|07 kelly|_|03 which words|_|07 she could or could not use|_|04 . gingrich once had a fascination|_|03 of his|_|01 own with bill|_|08 clinton|_|01 ’s sex|_|01 life|_|02 , as he was a driving|_|01 force|_|01 behind|_|01 the movement|_|04 to impeach|_|01 clinton|_|01 following|_|01 a consensual|_|01 sexual|_|02 relationship|_|01 he had with a young|_|01 former|_|03 intern|_|01 . clinton|_|01 became|_|02 the second|_|01 president|_|01 in american|_|02 history|_|02 to be impeached|_|01 by the house|_|01 , but he was acquitted|_|02 by the senate|_|01 . voters|_|01 , meanwhile|_|02 , punished|_|01 the republicans|_|01 for what they saw|_|01 as an overreach|_|01 : the gop|_|01 lost|_|01 five|_|01 house|_|01 seats|_|07 in the 1998 midterm|_|01 elections|_|04 , which led|_|23 to gingrich ’s resignation|_|03 as speaker|_|03 .
this article|_|04 about the murder|_|01 / suicide|_|01 of this couple|_|05 just further|_|05 proves|_|02 that people|_|01 who commit|_|01 acts|_|02 of murder|_|01 are usually|_|01 mentally|_|01 disturbed|_|02 . they will harm|_|01 someone|_|01 and themselves with or without access|_|06 to a gun|_|01 . this murder|_|01 / suicide|_|01 was clearly|_|01 not done by a gun|_|01 . there are so many|_|01 situations|_|03 where a murderer|_|01 will kill|_|01 themselves after they have harmed|_|01 someone|_|01 else|_|03 , proving|_|02 that they are very disturbed|_|01 and they should have received|_|02 help|_|02 of some sort|_|03 . this will prevent|_|02 them from harming|_|01 innocent|_|01 people|_|01 along|_|04 with themselves .
i ca|_|01 n't believe|_|01 that this happened|_|01 . can you imagine|_|02 what it must|_|01 be like|_|02 to flee|_|01 from something so incredibly|_|01 dangerous|_|02 and then lose|_|01 your life|_|05 at sea|_|03 or see|_|01 people|_|01 die|_|01 while you 're escaping|_|01 ? i wonder|_|01 sometimes|_|01 what must|_|01 possess|_|01 refugees|_|01 to do this . is there no other way|_|01 for them to escape|_|01 ? why do they risk|_|01 their lives|_|05 when they know|_|05 the numbers|_|07 of people|_|01 who die|_|01 in situations|_|01 like|_|02 this ? it must|_|01 be awful|_|01 where they are coming|_|01 from for them to risk|_|01 it all . i mean|_|04 , look|_|02 at that star|_|04 soccer|_|01 player|_|04 . she was like|_|02 royalty|_|02 in her country|_|04 and a celebrated|_|06 athlete|_|01 . if even|_|01 she took|_|06 the risk|_|04 and died|_|01 , what must|_|01 it be like|_|02 for other people|_|01 ?
it makes|_|43 me sad|_|02 to think|_|13 of this man|_|08 who was mentally|_|01 unstable|_|01 attacking|_|06 people|_|01 . i wonder|_|01 sometimes|_|01 how many|_|01 attacks|_|05 are attributed|_|01 to terrorists|_|01 when in reality|_|03 the people|_|01 might|_|01 just be mentally|_|01 ill|_|02 . i wish|_|03 we had a better|_|07 system|_|08 for treating|_|03 mental|_|05 illness|_|01 in our country|_|04 instead|_|01 of locking|_|09 people|_|01 away|_|09 .
friends|_|03 and family|_|01 - we need|_|03 to pray|_|01 for those people|_|01 in taiwan|_|02 . they have just been hit|_|10 by yet|_|03 another|_|01 hurricane|_|01 . this has left|_|03 their country|_|04 in quite|_|04 the run|_|05 down state|_|04 . people|_|01 are heavily|_|03 effected|_|02 in this country|_|04 and need|_|03 our thoughts|_|03 and prayers|_|04 . we also|_|02 need|_|03 to pray|_|01 for china|_|01 due|_|02 to the hurricane|_|01 heading|_|01 there next|_|03 .
oh|_|01 my god|_|01 ... i ca|_|01 n't even|_|03 imagine|_|02 the fear|_|03 those two|_|01 poor|_|01 boys|_|04 must|_|01 have felt|_|03 . i can only hope|_|03 they did not see|_|01 it coming|_|04 . how disturbed|_|01 must|_|01 one|_|01 be to see|_|01 this sort|_|03 of thing|_|05 as the only way|_|11 out , the right|_|12 thing|_|05 to do ? the pain|_|02 and loss|_|03 this family|_|01 is feeling|_|04 is probably|_|01 only compounded|_|02 due|_|02 to the conflicting|_|01 feelings|_|01 of someone|_|01 you love|_|01 committing|_|18 such an atrocious|_|03 act|_|04 on others you love|_|01 , whose lives|_|01 were just beginning|_|07 . poor|_|01 babies|_|04 ... i do hope|_|02 they did n't suffer|_|03 . it shows|_|01 that complaints|_|02 of domestic|_|03 issues|_|01 should be taken|_|06 seriously|_|01 , by everyone . it states|_|02 he was under investigation|_|01 / being sought|_|01 for domestic|_|03 violations|_|02 . how did he even|_|03 get|_|03 his|_|01 hands|_|07 on those boys|_|04 ? it 's so sad|_|02 .
this article|_|04 about a firecracker|_|01 going|_|03 off during a protest|_|03 is about the stupidest|_|01 thing|_|09 i have seen|_|01 in a while . the journalists|_|01 are pond|_|01 scum|_|02 trying|_|01 desperately|_|01 to write|_|05 anything they can to divide|_|12 people|_|03 up . college|_|03 kids|_|02 ca|_|01 n't bear|_|02 a firecracker|_|01 going|_|03 off , they need|_|02 to institute|_|02 mandatory|_|01 military|_|03 service|_|09 like|_|02 israel|_|02 does , then maybe|_|01 they would not be scared|_|01 chickens|_|01 crying|_|02 about everything .
if you have gone|_|01 through war|_|01 , gone|_|01 through hell|_|02 , you should expect|_|01 that when you come|_|04 home|_|09 to the country|_|04 that you have been fighting|_|06 to protect|_|02 that they will take|_|29 care|_|06 of you in some way|_|01 instead|_|01 of throwing|_|06 you out into the cold|_|03 and basically|_|01 tell|_|01 you good|_|01 luck|_|03 . it is heartbreaking|_|02 to know|_|01 people|_|01 out there are in poverty|_|01 , but especially|_|01 to know|_|01 that our war|_|01 veterans|_|03 are treated|_|08 this way|_|01 .
this article|_|02 reminds|_|01 me of an incident|_|01 that happened|_|01 when i was a teenager|_|01 . my step|_|04 dad|_|01 worked|_|03 at a power|_|05 plant|_|03 and there was some small|_|01 explosion|_|01 and three|_|02 people|_|03 died|_|04 . one|_|01 of them was the father|_|06 of a guy|_|03 i knew|_|04 from school|_|07 . i had heard|_|02 his|_|01 head|_|01 was crushed|_|01 . it was very disturbing|_|11 imagery|_|02 and it has stuck|_|01 with me since . i worry|_|01 about my husband|_|01 working|_|03 in a dangerous|_|02 job|_|01 , too , but it seems|_|04 generally|_|01 a lot|_|05 of guys|_|03 working|_|03 in these places|_|06 are n't following|_|08 safety|_|02 rules|_|12 and that 's how the accidents|_|02 happen|_|01 .
i just read|_|06 this article|_|02 about a wolf|_|04 being killed|_|01 after traveling|_|06 700 miles|_|02 by a government|_|02 agent|_|01 . i do n't understand|_|02 it ! there was no reason|_|03 for it . it had n't attacked|_|05 or disturbed|_|11 anyone so what was the point|_|20 of it all ? i feel|_|05 like|_|02 anymore|_|01 people|_|03 just kill|_|01 animals|_|01 to kill|_|01 . this is why one|_|05 day|_|01 so these animals|_|01 will be extinct|_|01 . i think|_|03 that it should be against the law|_|01 to kill|_|01 any animal|_|01 that has n't put|_|04 you in danger|_|03 in and way|_|01 ! this is not ok|_|01 ! this needs|_|03 to stop|_|04 ! i am disgusted|_|02 by it all !
it 's always|_|05 sad|_|01 to hear|_|02 about someone(s ) dying|_|01 especially|_|01 there are children|_|02 involved|_|01 , luckily|_|01 only adults|_|01 were killed|_|01 according|_|01 to the article|_|04 and the children|_|02 survived|_|01 but it 's emotional|_|03 , physical|_|04 , and mentally|_|01 hard|_|01 for the children|_|02 to adapt|_|03 to it . maybe|_|01 the adults|_|01 were there parents|_|01 and watching|_|06 somebody|_|01 kill|_|01 your own family|_|02 members|_|01 is heart|_|01 - wrenching|_|03 . my love|_|01 and prayers|_|01 go|_|01 out for the kids|_|02
this is awful|_|01 ! i just read|_|05 that a family|_|06 lost|_|01 two|_|01 family|_|06 pets|_|01 and their home|_|01 due|_|02 to a horrible|_|03 fire|_|01 , still|_|04 in investigation|_|01 ! this is one|_|05 of those times|_|04 when i let|_|02 my mind|_|01 wander|_|01 and i think|_|05 , what is going|_|01 to happen|_|01 to them ? where would they sleep|_|02 at night|_|07 ? and the pain|_|02 they must|_|01 feel|_|13 for not having the pets|_|01 , and a place|_|01 to call|_|03 their own .
a fire|_|09 destroyed|_|01 a family|_|04 's house|_|01 . the people|_|03 escaped|_|05 and suffered|_|08 no harm|_|01 but two|_|01 of their cats|_|02 died|_|11 . as a result|_|02 of the fire|_|09 , they are displaced|_|03 but at least|_|01 they 're alive|_|01 . at least|_|01 the red|_|02 cross|_|04 is helping|_|01 them out . they might|_|01 be sad|_|01 about the pets|_|01 but i am sure|_|06 they feel|_|01 fortunate|_|01 that no people|_|03 died|_|11 in this fire|_|09 .
i always|_|05 read|_|06 about these house|_|01 fires|_|01 and never|_|01 think|_|02 about them again . that is something that i should do less|_|01 of . maybe|_|01 i can find|_|10 a way|_|01 to donate|_|01 time|_|06 or money|_|03 for families|_|04 in tragedies|_|02 so that they can get|_|01 back|_|04 on their feet|_|01 as soon|_|01 as possible|_|01 . this recent|_|01 reversal|_|03 of my attitude|_|01 was because a friend|_|01 of mine|_|02 recently|_|01 had their apartment|_|01 burn|_|05 out due|_|02 to a building|_|01 fire|_|01 .
is val wilmer healthy|_|01 or not ? seems|_|04 as though|_|01 comments|_|01 keep|_|02 being made|_|03 about his|_|01 health|_|01 and now michael|_|01 douglas|_|01 has even|_|01 said|_|01 something about him . although , just because the two|_|01 worked|_|03 together|_|03 on the ghost|_|01 and the darkness|_|01 ( one|_|01 of the best|_|03 movies|_|01 ever|_|01 ! ) does n't give|_|01 him the right|_|01 to make|_|03 public|_|02 comments|_|01 about wilmer 's health|_|01 whether it 's true|_|12 or not . maybe|_|01 he does n't want|_|05 the whole|_|01 world|_|01 to know|_|05 if he 's going|_|04 through something .

hello|_|01 jane , how have you been , i want|_|05 to vent|_|02 out an article|_|02 i read|_|05 and is very heart|_|03 breaking|_|04 . a few families|_|06 lost|_|01 their loved|_|01 one|_|02 in a ride|_|08 at the dreamworld|_|01 theme|_|01 park|_|01 in queensland|_|01 , australia|_|01 . they were thrown|_|08 off the ride|_|08 into the water|_|03 . it is a very sad|_|02 story|_|02 and it will be investigated|_|02 , also|_|02 the dream|_|01 world|_|01 ceo|_|01 has created|_|03 a memorial|_|03 at the park|_|01 with 500|_|01 staff|_|06 to attend|_|10 , which is very kind|_|01 .
the article|_|04 was about new|_|01 global|_|01 warming|_|01 study.warns : desert|_|01 in southern|_|01 spain|_|01 in the future|_|03 — climate|_|01 scientists|_|01 from france|_|01 shared|_|01 a study|_|01 this week|_|01 about the possible|_|01 grim|_|01 future|_|03 awaiting|_|03 the country|_|04 of spain|_|01 , and the earth|_|04 as a whole|_|01 . they warned|_|02 that if climate|_|01 change|_|01 continues|_|02 , deserts|_|01 in the middle|_|03 east|_|05 will expand|_|09 to the mediterranean|_|01 and even|_|03 reach|_|07 southern|_|01 spain|_|01 , transforming|_|02 today|_|02 ’s deciduous|_|01 forests|_|02 into barren|_|08 lands|_|04 hostile|_|05 for plants|_|04 and animals|_|01 , and of course|_|04 including|_|03 humans|_|02 . last|_|07 year|_|03 , hundreds|_|01 of countries|_|04 around|_|01 the globe|_|01 have signed|_|04 a non|_|01 - binding|_|01 agreement|_|01 . known|_|03 as the paris|_|01 agreement|_|01 , its main|_|03 goal|_|01 is to stop|_|01 global|_|01 warning|_|02 by implementing|_|02 and keeping|_|02 long|_|01 - term|_|03 solutions|_|05 . the target|_|01 is to keep|_|02 temperature|_|01 rising|_|11 by more than 2|_|01 degrees|_|01 celsius|_|01 or 3.6 degrees|_|01 fahrenheit|_|01
i just read|_|06 about this australian|_|01 hiker|_|01 that was lost|_|01 in the malaysian|_|01 jungle|_|03 for two|_|01 weeks|_|01 and most of that time|_|03 without food|_|03 . he was week|_|01 but he survived|_|01 . i 'm shocked|_|02 . i 'm happy|_|04 he made|_|35 it because to often|_|05 you hear|_|02 those stories|_|03 of a lost|_|01 hiker|_|01 and it ends|_|04 tragically|_|01 . his|_|01 friends|_|01 and family|_|04 say|_|11 he has a strong|_|09 mental|_|01 attitude|_|01 , he must|_|01 . i do n't think|_|01 i 'd ever|_|01 survive|_|01 that long|_|01 especially|_|01 since i do n't even|_|01 know|_|05 anything about safe|_|03 plants|_|04 to eat|_|06 like|_|01 this guy|_|03 must|_|01 have . way|_|09 to go|_|01 sir|_|02 . way|_|09 to fight|_|03 .
hopefully|_|02 this fighting|_|01 ends|_|02 soon|_|01 its getting|_|02 to be too much|_|01 the negative|_|03 impact|_|02 is getting|_|02 bigger|_|01 and bigger|_|01 . if things|_|01 font|_|01 stop|_|01 before long|_|02 then the fighting|_|02 wo nt|_|01 be in that area|_|02 till|_|01 spread|_|09 even|_|02 wider|_|06 as all the larger|_|01 countries|_|04 get|_|02 involved|_|01 and the fighting|_|02 just wo nt|_|01 stop|_|01 . maybe|_|01 we should start|_|07 a petition|_|01 or something to get|_|02 some attention|_|01 on this issue|_|02
regardless|_|01 of what scientists|_|01 believe|_|01 the earth|_|01 is warming|_|01 . i think|_|10 that people|_|03 are constantly|_|02 always|_|02 trying|_|01 to come|_|04 up with reasons|_|06 as to what is happening|_|01 with the earth|_|01 , but these people|_|03 are trying|_|01 to pick|_|02 this lady|_|03 research|_|01 apart|_|02 . also|_|02 , i am not sure|_|06 how sexual|_|02 harassment|_|02 plays|_|22 into the article|_|04 , but that is a big|_|01 deal|_|06 in the us|_|01 . people|_|03 get|_|02 harassed|_|02 way|_|05 to often|_|03 in the workplace|_|01 with nothing|_|01 being done .
so tragic|_|01 and sad|_|02 that this police|_|01 officer|_|01 was just doing his|_|01 job|_|02 and now he 's gone|_|15 and his|_|01 family|_|08 is left|_|12 to grieve|_|02 his|_|01 loss|_|02 . i hope|_|02 they figure|_|01 out who did this and serve|_|01 justice|_|02 to the fullest|_|03 extent|_|01 . it sounds|_|02 like|_|02 it could be one|_|01 of the people|_|03 they found|_|01 dead|_|01 , though|_|01 . i guess|_|02 we 'll find|_|01 out later|_|01 .
class|_|08 differences|_|03 influence|_|01 and varies|_|03 how a parent|_|01 raises|_|02 their child|_|04 . middle|_|04 - class|_|08 parents|_|01 raise|_|02 their child|_|04 through the use|_|01 of feelings|_|01 and lower|_|05 - class|_|08 parents|_|01 raise|_|02 their children|_|04 through behavior|_|01 control|_|02 . middle|_|04 - class|_|08 parents|_|01 and lower|_|05 - class|_|08 parents|_|01 raise|_|02 their children|_|04 to be like|_|04 them feeling|_|05 and behavioral|_|01 wise|_|01 . middle|_|04 - class|_|08 children|_|04 get|_|01 reprimanded|_|01 for feeling|_|05 the wrong|_|07 way|_|11 and lower|_|05 - class|_|08 children|_|04 are punished|_|01 for behaving|_|02 badly|_|04
this really|_|01 saddens|_|02 me that people|_|01 are so lost|_|11 now a days|_|02 . it never|_|01 solves|_|01 anything to hurt|_|06 other people|_|01 and this just shows|_|08 a lack|_|01 of judgment|_|03 and remorse|_|01 . it feels|_|11 as though|_|01 there had been a disconnect|_|02 with humanity|_|08 and we do not have the respect|_|06 for each other that e|_|01 once had . i hope|_|03 that this person|_|01 can find|_|02 their way|_|06 to a better|_|07 path|_|05 .
i just read|_|03 an article|_|04 about the attacks|_|05 in a syrian|_|01 town|_|01 . it sounds|_|02 horrible|_|03 what they are going|_|01 through . it talks|_|02 about women|_|02 and children|_|03 dying|_|04 . i tried|_|01 to imagine|_|01 what it would be like|_|02 to live|_|01 in such horror|_|02 . it mentions|_|01 many|_|01 post|_|05 on social|_|05 media|_|02 of pictures|_|01 and videos|_|01 . i would be interested|_|01 in seeing|_|05 some of the pictures|_|01 and videos|_|01 of this violence|_|03 . reading|_|03 stuff|_|01 like|_|02 this really|_|01 makes|_|43 you appreciate|_|01 being in america|_|01 .
we just have a long|_|02 way|_|09 to go|_|03 . too many|_|01 times|_|04 we do not believe|_|01 the victim|_|02 especially|_|01 if they are females|_|02 . things|_|05 happen|_|01 to them especially|_|01 now and they are coming|_|04 out but we still|_|01 ask|_|01 for proof|_|02 when we should believe|_|01 in them most and that should be more than enough|_|02 proof|_|02 . we want|_|01 to believe|_|01 them and show|_|01 them that we care|_|02 as people|_|03 and that we would do what it takes|_|29 to get|_|04 them the justice|_|02 that they deserve|_|01
do you know|_|10 about erika virus|_|03 news|_|04 ? that like|_|04 dengue|_|01 and west|_|03 nile|_|01 virus|_|03 , this mosquito|_|01 - spread|_|07 disease|_|01 is now going|_|03 to be a regular|_|08 fixture|_|01 — and a perennial|_|02 risk|_|03 for pregnant|_|01 women|_|01 . the huge|_|01 bloom|_|01 of erika activity|_|01 in the americas|_|01 right|_|07 now is unprecedented|_|01 . a longtime|_|01 us|_|01 army|_|01 scientist|_|01 who is now semiretired , hal stead|_|01 believes|_|01 erika will vanish|_|01 in a few years|_|02 , likely|_|01 for decades|_|01 . that ’s the way|_|05 another|_|01 retrovirus|_|01 , chikungunya works|_|01 , he wrote|_|01 in an article|_|04 in emerging|_|03 infectious|_|01 diseases|_|01 last|_|05 year|_|02 . “ the rate|_|04 at which people|_|01 are getting|_|01 infected|_|01 right|_|07 now certainly|_|01 suggests|_|05 that we ’re heading|_|04 , within|_|02 a year|_|02 or two|_|01 , to achieve|_|01 sufficient|_|01 herd|_|01 immunity|_|02 for this virus|_|03 to die|_|04 out ,
the pipeline|_|02 seems|_|02 to be interfering|_|01 with native|_|03 american|_|02 tribes|_|02 and is causing|_|02 lots|_|04 of environmental|_|02 damage|_|02 . i do feel|_|12 for these individuals|_|01 , and it 's important|_|01 they get|_|02 all the help|_|01 they deserve|_|01 . their ancestors|_|01 were decimated|_|03 throughout|_|01 history|_|05 and there inst|_|02 enough|_|02 reparations|_|04 to solve|_|01 the genocide|_|01 that was caused|_|02 .
i heard|_|02 about a rock|_|02 climber|_|04 who died|_|01 in vietnam|_|01 trying|_|06 to scale|_|04 it 's highest|_|02 mountain|_|01 . i remember|_|07 we 've talked|_|02 about going|_|01 on vacation|_|02 there . sadly|_|02 it was a young|_|03 guy|_|03 , 22|_|01 , not much|_|05 younger|_|03 than us|_|01 . it 's a really|_|01 tragic|_|01 story|_|02 because he was on the trip|_|04 with his|_|01 girlfriend|_|02 and when it went|_|01 off on his|_|01 own he became|_|01 lost|_|11 . in his|_|01 final|_|03 moments|_|06 they were actually|_|03 in contact|_|02 through testing|_|02 .
i feel|_|05 sad|_|02 yet|_|01 again to here about more crimes|_|02 against the native|_|03 americans|_|03 . the pipeline|_|02 is disgusting|_|02 and will no doubt|_|02 result|_|03 in leaks|_|05 that contaminate|_|02 water|_|02 . it is good|_|13 that people|_|01 are protesting|_|02 but i do n't feel|_|05 it will end|_|02 up working|_|03 . there is oil|_|01 there and they will kill|_|02 people|_|01 if they need|_|03 to just like|_|02 they do in every|_|02 other country|_|04 .
so i just read|_|03 this article|_|02 , a very interesting|_|01 one|_|02 . you all need|_|02 to read|_|03 it to understand|_|03 what it is really|_|01 about . there is a way|_|11 the author|_|01 puts|_|04 things|_|05 in a very simple|_|06 way|_|11 for everyone to understand|_|03 . i would encourage|_|01 you all to find|_|01 it and read|_|03 it . it will be worth|_|01 your time|_|06 .
dear|_|04 friend|_|01 , i have just finished|_|02 reading|_|09 a very upsetting|_|04 and tragic|_|01 article|_|04 . it told|_|03 the story|_|01 of a young|_|01 teenage|_|02 girl|_|02 in india|_|01 named|_|02 ins ha|_|02 mustache|_|01 . she lost|_|08 her vision|_|03 and 14|_|01 years|_|03 old|_|03 because she was shot|_|03 repeatedly|_|01 with pellets|_|02 . she has been in and out of hospitals|_|02 for months|_|02 trying|_|01 to regain|_|03 her vision|_|03 , but so far|_|05 it has not been successful|_|01 . she is trying|_|01 to stay|_|04 positive|_|01 now but she knows|_|10 that she has a difficult|_|01 road|_|02 ahead|_|05 of her . i hope|_|03 that she regains|_|03 her sight|_|03 .
i do n't know|_|01 much|_|04 about the issues|_|01 in syria|_|01 and other countries|_|04 in the middle|_|04 east|_|03 , but i 'm not a fan|_|01 of war|_|02 or our place|_|01 in these international|_|03 conflicts|_|01 . the united|_|01 states|_|02 has had military|_|03 influence|_|04 in the middle|_|04 east|_|03 for way|_|01 too long|_|01 , and we were deceived|_|02 by president|_|02 obama at the time|_|03 he started|_|03 office|_|04 . he stated|_|02 he would pull|_|16 all troops|_|04 out , but that never|_|01 really|_|01 happened|_|04 . the troops|_|04 may|_|01 have decreased|_|02 , but we have a strong|_|03 presence|_|01 there still|_|04 .
take|_|35 a look|_|02 at this story|_|01 that i found|_|10 online|_|03 . it 's about forest|_|02 fires|_|01 being spread|_|02 out over a couple|_|05 of different|_|01 states|_|01 , pretty|_|01 interesting|_|01 . i know|_|01 that i sent|_|02 you the pictures|_|09 of what was happening|_|01 around|_|04 here , but you might|_|01 be also|_|02 interested|_|01 in reading|_|06 this story|_|01 about how it is happening|_|01 all over the place|_|01 .
we need|_|01 to recognize|_|02 that global|_|01 warming|_|02 is real|_|03 and acknowledge|_|04 our part|_|09 in it . we as a globe|_|01 need|_|01 to take|_|01 note|_|05 and work|_|02 together|_|05 . the great|_|01 barrier|_|03 reef|_|03 is one|_|03 of our planet|_|02 's more amazing|_|01 wonders|_|02 and we need|_|01 to do all we can to protect|_|02 it , while the amazon|_|02 is n't doing absolutely|_|02 fantastic|_|02 we 've improved|_|03 the quality|_|01 and conservation|_|03 .
that is really|_|01 sad|_|01 to hear|_|02 . it 's awful|_|01 that cars|_|01 can be so unsafe|_|04 and sometimes|_|01 people|_|01 forget|_|04 how easy|_|09 it is to get|_|01 into an accident|_|02 if everyone is n't careful|_|01 and observant|_|02 . it said|_|09 this happened|_|04 at 6:30pm so i wonder|_|02 if maybe|_|01 the sun|_|01 was shining|_|01 right|_|01 in someone|_|01 's eyes|_|05 because that has happened|_|04 to me at sunset|_|03 and i could barely|_|01 see|_|01 . it 's difficult|_|01 to pull|_|03 over and stop|_|05 in those conditions|_|08 as well|_|09 .
wow|_|02 - what a lucky|_|02 cop|_|05 ! ! i ca|_|01 n't believe|_|01 he was able|_|04 to stop|_|05 that guy|_|03 . the community|_|01 is much|_|05 better|_|13 off without him . as fascinating|_|01 as i find|_|05 true|_|12 crime|_|02 , i really|_|01 do n't understand|_|02 the impulse|_|01 of some people|_|03 to kill|_|10 . it 's crazy|_|02 . i ca|_|01 n't believe|_|01 the damage|_|02 that guy|_|03 caused|_|02 . luckily|_|01 , he was stopped|_|05 ! !
i think|_|11 we all need|_|01 to do a better|_|12 job|_|02 of taking|_|29 care|_|06 of are forest|_|02 and water|_|06 ways|_|05 because we rely|_|01 on these to survive|_|01 and if we are killing|_|01 animals|_|01 and fish|_|02 the wrong|_|05 way|_|05 and they start|_|10 to go|_|03 away|_|01 it could have a big|_|01 impact|_|02 on us|_|01 and by that time|_|06 it could be to late|_|01 to do anything about it . so we need|_|01 to put|_|04 laws|_|01 in that will help|_|05 the animals|_|01 but also|_|02 help|_|05 allow|_|01 us|_|01 to fish|_|02 for them the right|_|04 way|_|05 not by taking|_|29 a shortcut|_|01
you know|_|05 i 'm not a fan|_|01 of religion|_|02 in any context|_|02 , but this type|_|06 of thing|_|11 happens|_|02 everywhere|_|01 . there 's always|_|04 some idiot|_|01 who goes|_|01 off and uses|_|01 religion|_|02 , bigotry|_|01 , sex|_|04 , gender|_|04 , anything really|_|01 as an explanation|_|03 . it 's sad|_|02 that you read|_|06 something like|_|02 this and it does n't even|_|01 feel|_|05 like|_|02 news|_|01 . perhaps|_|01 its just our access|_|02 that 's making|_|02 this seem|_|02 ordinary|_|01 .
just came|_|04 across|_|02 an article|_|02 that involves|_|07 shootings|_|02 and people|_|01 being killed|_|01 . the story|_|02 is about a white|_|10 person|_|01 in his|_|01 50|_|01 's if i am not mistaking|_|01 that was bothered|_|01 by the loud|_|01 music|_|05 that was playing|_|26 in a duran go|_|01 by some black|_|04 teenagers|_|01 at a gas|_|01 station|_|01 in florida|_|01 . there was an argument|_|03 regarding|_|05 the music|_|05 and some exchange|_|02 of words|_|02 . the white|_|10 guy|_|03 shot|_|03 the 17|_|01 year|_|01 old|_|01 black|_|04 kid|_|01 6|_|01 times|_|01 . he was convicted|_|01 for life|_|01 with the possibility|_|02 of parole|_|01 after 2|_|01 years|_|01 . he was denied|_|05 . these situations|_|01 are complicated|_|02 and they are happening|_|01 quite|_|04 often|_|01 lately|_|01 . there should be a limit|_|05 on many|_|01 things|_|07 , and one|_|05 of them should be the guns|_|02 . there should be a stricter|_|03 gun|_|02 control|_|02 .
i like|_|02 we expect|_|04 turkey|_|02 to safeguard|_|01 its parliamentary|_|03 democracy|_|01 , including|_|02 respect|_|03 for human|_|03 rights|_|08 and the rule|_|04 of law|_|01 , and we are conveying|_|01 these expectations|_|03 directly|_|01 to the turkish|_|01 authorities|_|01 , ” gathering|_|01 said|_|01 in a statement|_|04 with the eu|_|01 ’s enlargement|_|03 commissioner|_|02 , erdoğan has launched|_|04 repeated|_|05 personal|_|04 attacks|_|09 on demirtaş , who analysts|_|03 have seen|_|05 as the sole|_|01 politician|_|03 in turkey|_|02 who comes|_|01 anywhere|_|01 near|_|03 to rivaling|_|02 his|_|01 charisma|_|01 . demirtaş has made|_|43 it a personal|_|04 crusade|_|02 to oppose|_|02 erdoğan ’s plan|_|02 for a presidential|_|02 system|_|04 in turkey|_|02 , which the hp|_|01 says|_|01 would lead|_|03 to dictatorship|_|01 .
i ca|_|01 n't imagine|_|02 what it must|_|01 have been like|_|02 for the people|_|03 who were caught|_|01 up in this , how helpless|_|03 they must|_|01 have felt|_|03 . not having any recourse|_|02 for so long|_|01 , no one|_|03 doing anything to right|_|01 the wrongs|_|02 , just feeling|_|04 like|_|02 it 's ok|_|01 for you to be abused|_|03 and for it to go|_|02 on for so long|_|02 and happen|_|01 to so many|_|01 people|_|03 . maybe|_|01 they feel|_|04 some kind|_|01 of closure|_|05 now though|_|01 .
working|_|02 out is important|_|01 , but you may|_|01 want|_|05 to check|_|08 the ingredients|_|03 of the supplements|_|02 you take|_|09 . this article|_|04 talks|_|02 about a number|_|01 of ingredients|_|03 that can cause|_|01 dangerous|_|02 side|_|09 effects|_|02 and are also|_|02 very common|_|09 in work|_|05 out supplements|_|02 . it 's scary|_|01 to think|_|01 about what we are putting|_|07 in our body|_|01 . from now on , i am probably|_|01 going|_|01 to cut|_|01 back|_|06 and go|_|01 more natural|_|09 .
did you hear|_|02 about the earthquake|_|01 in tanzania|_|01 ? there were over 200|_|01 deaths|_|06 . it 's so scary|_|01 because you ca|_|01 n't really|_|01 prepare|_|12 for something like|_|02 that . i live|_|01 in california|_|01 so people|_|03 are always|_|04 warning|_|01 us|_|01 about the san andres fault|_|01 line|_|02 . i get|_|02 so worried|_|01 thinking|_|02 about how bad|_|09 it might|_|01 get|_|02 if something like|_|02 that happens|_|04 to us|_|01 .
i 'm glad|_|02 that they finally|_|01 put|_|01 an end|_|08 to this mans|_|08 killing|_|01 spree|_|01 . i 'm not sure|_|06 why he did what he did but he was obviously|_|01 mentally|_|01 ill|_|05 and was n't taking|_|02 his|_|01 medication|_|02 . i believe|_|05 friends|_|01 had to have been helping|_|01 him hide|_|05 otherwise|_|01 i do n't know|_|01 how he could have hidden|_|05 so long|_|02 otherwise|_|01 . anyways|_|01 , incidents|_|02 like|_|02 this only makes|_|27 them try|_|01 to crack|_|02 down harder|_|11 on guns|_|02 and our rights|_|06 to bear|_|06 arms|_|01 , but this person|_|01 was clearly|_|01 mentally|_|01 ill|_|05 .
it 's always|_|02 sad|_|02 when you lose|_|07 the legends|_|01 no matter|_|06 what . for one|_|01 it makes|_|36 you feel|_|04 old|_|01 but for two|_|01 you lose|_|07 any future|_|03 of their work|_|02 . it is also|_|02 sad|_|02 for the family|_|01 who loses|_|07 a loved|_|01 one|_|01 and is hard|_|01 to imagine|_|02 the responsibility|_|01 of keeping|_|02 up the name|_|01 of the famous|_|01 person|_|03 they 've loss|_|05 . i mean|_|04 how do you know|_|05 what they would do with the rights|_|07 of their music|_|05 or if you should even|_|01 use|_|01 them anymore|_|01 ?
hey what s going|_|01 on jacob|_|02 ? i want|_|01 to tell|_|01 vent|_|04 out something i read|_|06 in this article|_|04 . there was a saudi|_|01 - led|_|03 coalition|_|03 that is backed|_|01 by the us|_|01 , they had led|_|03 an attack|_|01 in yemen|_|01 , that had killed|_|01 around|_|04 43|_|01 people|_|01 . this is sad|_|01 to hear|_|04 so much|_|01 killing|_|02 in this world|_|08 . according|_|01 to what i read|_|06 this happened|_|01 because they are trying|_|01 to take|_|06 someone|_|01 out of power|_|01 and they are trying|_|01 to bring|_|04 in a new|_|05 leader|_|01 , i think|_|02 his|_|01 name|_|02 is abed|_|01 rambo man|_|08 sour|_|02 . the usa|_|01 wants|_|01 to put|_|07 him in there . also|_|02 they are more people|_|01 dying|_|01 from the long|_|01 conflict|_|01 , people|_|01 are starving|_|02 and also|_|02 planes|_|04 had attacked|_|03 a funeral|_|01 place|_|01 and they had killed|_|01 people|_|01 there as well|_|03 . all this necessary|_|01 killing|_|02 is not good|_|13 for this word|_|07 . this is really|_|01 , really|_|01 bad|_|01 that we need|_|02 war|_|01 to solve|_|01 problems|_|02 .
wow|_|02 , can you believe|_|01 he survived|_|01 in the jungle|_|01 that long|_|01 on his|_|01 own ? it is amazing|_|01 what the human|_|03 body|_|01 is capable|_|02 of hey ? i remember|_|02 the last|_|02 time|_|03 i went|_|01 a couple|_|03 days|_|07 without food|_|03 and it was so intense|_|01 . people|_|01 think|_|10 they are ready|_|03 to survive|_|01 in the wild|_|01 but we really|_|01 have so few skills|_|02 to get|_|01 food|_|03 for ourselves without the right|_|01 tools|_|01 . it 's amazing|_|01 that he was found|_|10 after all that time|_|03 . i wonder|_|03 how long|_|01 it will take|_|29 for him to recover|_|01 ?
this article|_|04 greatly|_|01 disturbs|_|11 me . the fact|_|03 that we treat|_|01 muslims|_|01 and people|_|01 of their culture|_|04 like|_|04 dogs|_|01 and terrorist|_|01 is disgusting|_|02 and wrong|_|05 both morally|_|02 and ethically|_|01 . the way|_|01 they are being shown|_|12 on tv|_|01 and media|_|02 is wrong|_|05 and horrible|_|03 . our president|_|01 thinks|_|10 that if we ban|_|02 muslims|_|01 from the country|_|04 , all of a sudden|_|01 our nation|_|04 is safe|_|02 . when the fact|_|03 of the matter|_|02 is , most shootings|_|02 that happen|_|04 in this country|_|04 , are from caucasians|_|01 . muslims|_|01 are shown|_|12 in bad|_|01 light|_|01 due|_|02 to some extremist|_|01 and they do not deserve|_|01 this treatment|_|03 .
i feel|_|05 so sad|_|02 for the world|_|01 . the world|_|01 needs|_|03 a revolution|_|03 and good|_|01 people|_|01 in charge|_|03 of the countries|_|01 . bad|_|01 people|_|01 need|_|03 to disappear|_|04 from this world|_|01 , we need|_|03 specials|_|03 force|_|02 to deal|_|01 with injustice|_|02 from this world|_|01 . a lot|_|02 of people|_|01 is in pain|_|02 because of different|_|03 beliefs|_|01 , race|_|03 , culture|_|02 and bad|_|01 presidents|_|01 . people|_|01 around|_|04 the world|_|01 should have the same opportunities|_|01 to be happy|_|02 and have a fair|_|01 life|_|13 . i would like|_|04 to help|_|01 every|_|02 injustice|_|02 in the world|_|01 . big|_|01 countries|_|01 in the would should help|_|01 all the people|_|01 that are suffering|_|03 because of injustice|_|02 . i can see|_|05 a lot|_|02 of pain|_|02 around|_|04 the world|_|01 and i just can say|_|01 that a lot|_|02 of people|_|01 with resources|_|02 are extremely|_|01 selfish|_|01 . we need|_|03 powerful|_|01 people|_|01 dealing|_|01 with this kind|_|01 of situations|_|01 . on the other hand|_|06 , people|_|01 should make|_|03 disappear|_|04 isis|_|01 from the map|_|01 asap|_|01 .
that 's really|_|01 strange|_|02 that people|_|01 would make|_|43 such a big|_|01 deal|_|06 about her being single|_|07 and running|_|03 for office|_|03 . that seems|_|02 really|_|01 petty|_|01 , i wish|_|02 people|_|01 would focus|_|02 all their attention|_|03 on the real|_|02 issues|_|02 when it comes|_|01 to politics|_|01 . it seemed|_|02 like|_|02 the rules|_|12 for moldova|_|01 did n't consider|_|05 that a single|_|07 person|_|01 might|_|01 run|_|03 , i think|_|06 they should update|_|03 it .
a man|_|09 has took|_|02 it on himself to kill|_|01 evasive|_|02 mice|_|04 that have doubled|_|01 in size|_|03 on an island|_|01 . the mice|_|04 feed|_|01 on birds|_|01 and when the birds|_|01 have babies|_|03 its like|_|02 a buffet|_|01 for them to thrive|_|02 on . i imagine|_|02 it must|_|01 be disgusting|_|02 to have so many|_|01 mice|_|04 doing what they please|_|02 and destroying|_|04 other animals|_|01 . it gives|_|43 me the creeps|_|03 thinking|_|05 about it .
z|_|02 did you hear|_|02 ? ? kate unsaleable|_|01 and len wise|_|12 man|_|10 broke|_|28 up ! ! ! ! i ca|_|01 n't believe|_|03 it . what happened|_|01 ? i 'm distraught|_|01 . at least|_|01 they do n't have any kids|_|01 so they do n't have to put|_|01 them through that whole|_|01 thing|_|08 about divorce|_|01 . but i mean|_|04 come|_|01 on , she can barely|_|01 even|_|01 wait|_|04 to get|_|21 back|_|06 out there , without her wedding|_|02 ring|_|03 ? ? ? jeez . sad|_|02 .
i just read|_|06 an article|_|04 about 500|_|01 people|_|01 being killed|_|01 in an earthquake|_|02 . i feel|_|01 so blessed|_|04 that i live|_|02 in a state|_|06 where i do n’t fear|_|01 earthquakes|_|02 , or severe|_|02 tornado|_|01 warnings|_|03 , flash|_|02 floods|_|02 or major|_|08 disasters|_|01 . of course|_|02 vermont|_|01 has had our issues|_|02 and weather|_|01 events|_|01 that caused|_|02 damage|_|02 , however|_|01 we ’re not in a region|_|04 of the world|_|03 where we fear|_|01 for our lives|_|02 at certain|_|03 months|_|02 of the year|_|03 . i could not imagine|_|02 being terrified|_|01 for my children|_|02 , property|_|05 , and family|_|04 like|_|04 some of these families|_|04 are . living|_|02 through an experience|_|02 like|_|04 that , must|_|01 leave|_|12 behind|_|05 emotional|_|03 scars|_|10 while growing|_|07 up .
you know|_|05 how you were having trouble|_|02 sleeping|_|02 ? here , read|_|06 about people|_|03 who have tinnitus|_|01 - it 'll put|_|04 you to sleep|_|02 . i feel|_|05 like|_|02 more should be done to help|_|01 the seven|_|01 percent|_|01 who say|_|11 their tinnitus|_|01 is a big|_|08 problem|_|01 for them , though|_|01 . that 's the same as any other psychiatric|_|01 complaint|_|04 , right|_|01 ? if it 's affecting|_|05 your life|_|06 so that you ca|_|01 n't function|_|01 normally|_|01 , there should be some kind|_|01 of help|_|01 for you
since trump|_|02 became|_|02 president|_|01 it has been clear|_|01 that people|_|01 who are racist|_|02 , misogynist|_|01 , and sexist|_|01 people|_|01 have been hiding|_|02 , probably|_|01 because society|_|02 overall|_|02 expresses|_|01 these things|_|09 as a bad|_|01 thing|_|09 . but since they see|_|05 a leader|_|01 that is like|_|04 them , it gives|_|36 them fuel|_|01 to be bad|_|01 people|_|01 in public|_|02 and even|_|03 are proud|_|01 of it . i just hate|_|01 trump|_|02 and everything about him as well|_|12 as his|_|01 supporters|_|01 .
what i learned|_|02 about this situation|_|02 was that sometimes|_|01 life|_|02 is not fair|_|07 . seeing|_|05 this boy|_|01 trapped|_|01 in a place|_|06 for 4|_|01 days|_|01 is terrible|_|01 . his|_|01 poor|_|01 body|_|01 tried|_|01 to survive|_|01 and grab|_|05 on for dear|_|03 life|_|02 but children|_|02 are not exempt|_|01 from this life|_|02 . to think|_|03 about that kid|_|02 in that position|_|02 makes|_|45 me sad|_|02 . his|_|01 family|_|02 is the one|_|02 that suffers|_|10 unfortunately|_|01 .
another|_|01 example|_|01 of the government|_|02 disregard|_|02 for the indian|_|01 people|_|01 who lived|_|01 here before we ever|_|03 arrived|_|02 . sad|_|02 in this day|_|02 and age|_|01 they are just trying|_|01 to protect|_|01 their land|_|04 . stop|_|04 the potential|_|01 for environmental|_|02 damage|_|02 to the land|_|04 where they have lived|_|01 for thousands|_|01 of years|_|03 . do n't we learn|_|01 anything from history|_|02 . how can they shot|_|03 and harm|_|01 these people|_|01 just protecting|_|01 their land|_|04 and way|_|01 of life|_|07 .
istanbul|_|01 , have you heard|_|01 what is going|_|09 on over near|_|01 turkey|_|02 ? man|_|01 i am not even|_|04 really|_|01 sure|_|08 myself but it sounds|_|02 pretty|_|01 messed|_|02 up . at least|_|01 eight|_|01 members|_|01 of parliament|_|01 were charged|_|03 with some type|_|06 terrorism|_|01 - related|_|02 crimes|_|02 . this is just sickening|_|04 to me . turkey|_|02 ’s parliament|_|01 voted|_|03 to strip|_|01 lawmakers|_|01 of their immunity|_|01
trump|_|02 refuses|_|05 to take|_|02 a salary|_|01 from the government|_|02 for being president|_|01 . well|_|05 he is rich|_|02 so $ 400,000 is probably|_|01 nothing|_|01 to him . its saving|_|09 the government|_|02 but that would probably|_|01 be the only smart|_|07 move|_|05 he s made|_|08 since he s been in the white|_|05 house|_|07 period|_|02 . in not a trump|_|02 supporter|_|01 but i like|_|02 the idea|_|01 that he chose|_|01 to save|_|09 the government|_|02 money|_|03 .
reading|_|06 this article|_|04 makes|_|43 me upset|_|01 . i hate|_|01 what we do to native|_|03 people|_|01 . it seems|_|04 as a society|_|03 we seem|_|04 to ignore|_|04 their feelings|_|02 and traditions|_|01 just to move|_|02 ourselves forward|_|03 . we forget|_|03 that we intruded|_|01 onto their land|_|04 to make|_|43 ourselves homes|_|01 that we enjoy|_|02 yet|_|01 we ca|_|01 n't offer|_|02 them the same good|_|13 feeling|_|02 . to even|_|03 think|_|01 that the option|_|02 of having dangerous|_|02 amounts|_|02 of mercury|_|04 seep|_|01 into the waters|_|01 is beyond|_|03 me .
" a little|_|01 animal|_|01 called|_|01 the aquitaine|_|01 is an endangered|_|02 species|_|01 . efforts|_|02 are being made|_|16 to save|_|06 the species|_|01 but many|_|01 conservation|_|02 groups|_|03 do not think|_|03 these efforts|_|02 will be successful|_|01 . they call|_|01 it " " quick|_|01 fix|_|01 " " intervention|_|01 . usually|_|01 , when efforts|_|02 are made|_|16 to conserve|_|03 a species|_|01 , the efforts|_|02 are unsuccessful|_|01 . apparently|_|01 these animals|_|01 are small|_|01 porpoises|_|01 which get|_|01 trapped|_|04 in nets|_|02 . "
you know|_|01 i love|_|01 playing|_|02 devil|_|01 's advocate|_|01 and having random|_|01 views|_|03 on things|_|01 . well|_|05 here 's another|_|01 one|_|05 of my crazy|_|01 ideas|_|03 so prepare|_|02 yourself . i think|_|01 that the mayor|_|01 of sacramento|_|01 is blessed|_|01 that 's all that happened|_|01 to him . yes|_|01 he may|_|01 be upset|_|02 and a little|_|08 shaken|_|09 , but he still|_|01 gets|_|03 to go|_|04 home|_|01 to his|_|01 family|_|01 and enjoy|_|02 his|_|01 wealth|_|03 . he does n't lose|_|06 his|_|01 job|_|02 and he is n't majorly damaged|_|02 . i would easily|_|03 take|_|01 a pie|_|01 in the face|_|01 if afterwards|_|01 i was a rich|_|02 white|_|10 man|_|10 who still|_|01 had supporters|_|01 behind|_|02 me .
that 's interesting|_|01 about the buzzing|_|01 possibly|_|02 being created|_|03 by the brain|_|01 . i always|_|01 thought|_|03 it was created|_|03 by the auditory|_|01 nerve|_|01 . someone|_|01 very close|_|01 to me deals|_|02 with tinnitus|_|01 every|_|02 day|_|01 , and i always|_|01 thought|_|03 it was odd|_|05 because i 'm the one|_|02 who has worked|_|36 in high|_|05 noise|_|05 environments|_|02 , but she 's the one|_|02 who suffers|_|03 with it . it 's interesting|_|03 because it says|_|01 psychotherapy|_|02 is a possible|_|01 solution|_|05 which would make|_|03 us|_|01 very happy|_|01 if it 's real|_|02 .
did you hear|_|02 about the shipwreck|_|03 in egypt|_|01 ? unfortunately|_|01 it looks|_|02 like|_|02 fifty|_|01 five|_|03 people|_|03 have died|_|01 . it 's such a sad|_|02 story|_|01 . i feel|_|05 so bad|_|01 for the families|_|01 and that has to be a odd|_|02 feeling|_|02 for the 150|_|01 or so that survived|_|02 . so many|_|01 people|_|03 swam|_|05 to save|_|02 their lives|_|01 . i would never|_|02 be able|_|02 to do that ! there were also|_|02 children|_|02 on the boat|_|01 , so that is incredibly|_|01 sad|_|02 . i hate|_|01 that people|_|03 died|_|01 and had no chance|_|02 of survival|_|01 .
i 'm not sure|_|02 how to feel|_|06 about animals|_|01 that are considered|_|01 as abused|_|03 when being used|_|01 for entertainment|_|01 purposes|_|02 . it gives|_|18 us|_|01 the opportunity|_|01 to learn|_|08 and see|_|08 them up close|_|01 but at the same time|_|02 its hard|_|03 to handle|_|02 the fact|_|03 that these animals|_|01 might|_|01 be feeling|_|06 pain|_|02 . i mean|_|04 imagine|_|01 being captive|_|02 by monkeys|_|01 your whole|_|01 life|_|02 so they can introduce|_|07 them to humans|_|02 . would be sad|_|02 .
honestly|_|02 i do feel|_|04 bad|_|01 for him but at the same time|_|04 you should not be taking|_|34 a selfish|_|01 around|_|04 an animal|_|01 that is clearly|_|01 so dangerous|_|01 . pythons|_|03 are really|_|01 dangerous|_|01 animals|_|01 and i get|_|02 that the man|_|08 had rescued|_|02 the reptile|_|01 from a local|_|02 hotel|_|01 but even|_|03 still|_|01 , you need|_|01 to have your eyes|_|05 on that thing|_|01 at all times|_|04 . i feel|_|04 like|_|02 some people|_|03 are not as responsible|_|01 as they should be , and that goes|_|03 for anything . people|_|03 are too busy|_|05 spending|_|02 their life|_|01 looking|_|02 through the viewfinder|_|03 of their smartphone camera|_|01 and are so busy|_|05 trying|_|01 to document|_|02 everything online|_|03 in their desperate|_|01 , never|_|01 ending|_|04 quest|_|01 for more likes|_|02 and followers|_|02 that they are willing|_|01 to put|_|07 their personal|_|01 safety|_|06 on the line|_|03 , and that 's really|_|01 sad|_|02 and i think|_|01 it really|_|01 speaks|_|02 to where we 're going|_|03 as a society|_|02 as well|_|03 , and it 's frustrating|_|02 .
i am so bothered|_|05 and upset|_|01 about the elementary|_|02 school|_|05 teacher|_|02 that was charged|_|20 with child|_|03 pornography|_|01 . i can not believe|_|01 a trusted|_|01 individual|_|01 would commit|_|01 such a heinous|_|01 crime|_|02 involving|_|07 children|_|03 ! this infuriates|_|01 me to my core|_|01 that someone|_|01 could hurt|_|02 innocent|_|04 children|_|03 this way|_|02 ! does this make|_|02 you just as mad|_|02 ? i really|_|01 feel|_|05 for those parents|_|01 of the children|_|03 involved|_|07 and hope|_|03 that it does not do permanent|_|02 damage|_|03 to all those sweet|_|04 babies|_|03 !
you mean|_|04 you ca|_|01 n't breathe|_|02 in smog|_|01 and pollution|_|01 and walk|_|01 away|_|02 unscathed|_|01 ? who knew|_|05 ? ! this article|_|04 states|_|02 so much|_|01 obviousness|_|01 , that you would hope|_|02 people|_|01 were already|_|01 aware|_|01 of these issues|_|02 . you have cancer|_|05 ? well|_|01 , you had better|_|13 move|_|01 away|_|02 from that smog|_|01 bowl|_|01 you live|_|02 in ! india|_|01 and china|_|01 are both owners|_|02 of some nasty|_|02 smog|_|01 infested|_|03 cities|_|03 . not surprised|_|01 .
so sad|_|02 ! the middle|_|04 east|_|05 just keeps|_|02 getting|_|02 worse|_|01 . i hate|_|01 what ’s happening|_|03 to these people|_|03 , but i ’m not sure|_|02 how to solve|_|01 it . i wish|_|02 there was a simple|_|01 , easy|_|03 fix|_|01 . however|_|01 , it seems|_|02 like|_|02 every|_|02 time|_|02 we try|_|01 to fix|_|02 something it just gets|_|02 worse|_|01 . it ’s such a complex|_|01 situation|_|03 with no easy|_|03 answer|_|02 . unfortunately|_|01 , i do n’t see|_|05 it being solved|_|01 any time|_|02 soon|_|01 .
josh|_|02 , i just read|_|06 about the calais|_|01 refugee|_|01 camp|_|01 that was set|_|02 up in france|_|01 to house|_|07 the people|_|01 from syria|_|01 that the maniac|_|02 killing|_|04 his|_|01 own people|_|01 drove|_|02 away|_|02 . the problem|_|01 with all of this is the country|_|04 of syria|_|01 must|_|01 come|_|05 to a place|_|02 where they take|_|06 back|_|01 what has been taken|_|06 from them . but you know|_|01 why they ca|_|01 n't ? the citizens|_|01 were not allowed|_|01 to be armed|_|02 and any weapons|_|01 they have now have been supplied|_|01 by us|_|01 and the allies|_|01 . perfect|_|03 example|_|04 as to why our founders|_|02 wrote|_|05 the second|_|01 amendment|_|02 .
this article|_|04 talks|_|02 about pouching|_|02 in africa|_|01 . it 's really|_|01 sad|_|02 hearing|_|02 about the rhinos|_|01 . we need|_|02 to protect|_|02 these animals|_|01 . these animals|_|01 are more important|_|01 that the people|_|01 poaching|_|01 them . those poachers|_|02 deserve|_|01 to die|_|05 ; they are horrible|_|03 people|_|01 and they are destroying|_|04 a unique|_|02 species|_|01 . this is a terrible|_|01 thing|_|12 . they desperately|_|01 need|_|02 to protect|_|02 these poor|_|01 rhinos|_|01 from people|_|01 .
this is troubling|_|05 as it is unusual|_|03 to have two|_|01 people|_|03 die|_|05 of this cause|_|01 at the same time|_|06 . this seems|_|02 suspicious|_|01 as well|_|13 . i hope|_|02 the authorities|_|06 can find|_|02 some answers|_|02 so this tragedy|_|01 is not repeated|_|01 . i hope|_|02 the family|_|08 can eventually|_|01 find|_|02 some peace|_|05 and get|_|02 the information|_|05 they need|_|02 for closure|_|05 on their loss|_|01 .
so , a man|_|03 in china|_|01 , put|_|07 a chopstick|_|01 into his|_|01 penis|_|01 . yeah|_|01 , you heard|_|02 me . he wanted|_|05 to see|_|02 if he had an infection|_|07 or something , and instead|_|01 of being a normal|_|03 person|_|01 , and going|_|05 to the doctor|_|01 , he decided|_|02 to self|_|02 examine|_|01 and see|_|02 what he could find|_|04 . he ended|_|02 up having to have surgery|_|02 to remove|_|08 the chopstick|_|01 out of his|_|01 penis|_|01 . what would possess|_|01 a man|_|03 , to do such a thing|_|08 ? , the only thing|_|08 i can think|_|01 of after reading|_|06 this story|_|02 , , is about how real|_|03 mental|_|05 illness|_|01 is .. there is no other excuse|_|01 in my opinion|_|02 on why someone|_|01 so masochistic|_|01 . i mean|_|04 , the doctors|_|01 said|_|01 , any further , and he would have killed|_|01 himself . it hurts|_|02 me just thinking|_|01 about this .
this breaks|_|02 my heart|_|01 . i mean|_|04 , i know|_|01 there 's trouble|_|03 everywhere|_|01 , but these people|_|01 have absolutely|_|02 no hope|_|05 , and the united|_|05 states|_|04 caused|_|02 this , so we share|_|01 responsibility|_|03 . i 'm going|_|01 to look|_|02 around|_|04 and see|_|02 which refugee|_|01 organizations|_|05 are trying|_|01 to help|_|01 , and gather|_|07 donation|_|02 information|_|05 . are you in ? i 'll see|_|02 if alan wants|_|01 to bring|_|02 this up at church|_|04 , too .
this is just crazy|_|03 , you have to feel|_|05 for the mother|_|05 , but at the same time|_|04 what kind|_|01 of apartment|_|01 has that many|_|01 violations|_|02 and is still|_|01 not punished|_|01 . they need|_|03 to sue|_|01 them and anybody involved|_|01 with this . i ca|_|01 nt|_|01 believe|_|01 that in today|_|01 's society|_|02 that tragedies|_|02 like|_|02 this are tolerated|_|03 . somebody|_|01 needs|_|03 to go|_|22 to jail|_|01 for the death|_|05 of this little|_|02 girl|_|02 and the injuries|_|02 that her mother|_|05 suffered|_|03 . i ca|_|01 nt|_|01 imagine|_|02 what the mother|_|05 is going|_|22 through and she probably|_|01 blames|_|02 herself . things|_|11 like|_|02 this should just not happen|_|02 .
this is just such a sad|_|02 situation|_|02 . i wish|_|01 they had been able|_|01 to find|_|01 out more when they investigated|_|02 , but i guess|_|02 they ca|_|01 n't always|_|04 get|_|01 it right|_|01 . i really|_|01 feel|_|05 for the father|_|01 . he did what he could to stop|_|01 his|_|01 son|_|02 and he was n't able|_|01 to . it reminds|_|01 me of a certain|_|07 person|_|03 i know|_|10 whose family|_|08 member|_|01 was involved|_|02 in a different|_|03 kind|_|01 of violent|_|01 extremism|_|01 . sometimes|_|01 people|_|03 you love|_|01 go|_|03 on terrible|_|01 paths|_|05 and you do n't have enough|_|02 information|_|05 to do anything until it 's too late|_|06 .
this article|_|04 is so alarming|_|02 . the fact|_|04 that many|_|01 indonesians|_|02 are n't safe|_|02 in their own home|_|01 country|_|04 is very distressing|_|01 . a lot|_|05 of people|_|01 ca|_|01 n't afford|_|01 to leave|_|06 , so they 're stuck|_|02 risking|_|01 their lives|_|01 because of this haze|_|01 , which is nothing|_|01 that they can do anything about . a lot|_|05 of innocent|_|07 people|_|01 are getting|_|02 a raw|_|06 deal|_|06 , here .
i just read|_|06 about the arrest|_|02 of the women|_|01 from that national|_|01 geographic|_|02 magazine|_|01 . you know|_|05 , the one|_|02 with the striking|_|05 green|_|04 eyes|_|03 . she 's in her 40s|_|01 now , and she was just arrested|_|07 for staying|_|04 illegally|_|01 in pakistan|_|01 . if worst|_|10 comes|_|20 to worst|_|10 , she could be put|_|01 in jail|_|01 for 14|_|01 years|_|03 or deported|_|01 back|_|04 to the place|_|01 she was trying|_|01 to escape|_|01 . it breaks|_|07 my heart|_|10 to see|_|01 refugees|_|01 who are just looking|_|01 for a safe|_|01 place|_|01 to live|_|05 being at risk|_|04 for deportation|_|03 .
showing|_|01 just how amazing|_|01 females|_|02 have been doing especially|_|01 in sports|_|02 . it makes|_|08 you wonder|_|02 just how hard|_|01 they have been working|_|02 and becoming|_|01 role|_|02 models|_|09 for young|_|01 girls|_|02 . that they would do whatever|_|01 it took|_|04 to become|_|01 something and people|_|03 like|_|02 rounds|_|09 rouse|_|01 and how much|_|01 she achieved|_|01 just shows|_|01 what it means|_|03 to be a champion|_|01 .
i just read|_|06 this article|_|04 about contact|_|09 lenses|_|01 . it has some good|_|13 information|_|05 about the risks|_|04 associated|_|01 with improper|_|03 wear|_|03 of contacts|_|09 . i ca|_|01 n't believe|_|01 there are some people|_|03 who store|_|02 their lenses|_|01 in tap|_|02 water|_|01 . gross|_|01 ! i definitely|_|01 make|_|43 it a point|_|23 to not wear|_|09 my lenses|_|01 over the 30|_|01 day|_|02 limit|_|01 and i try|_|01 to never|_|01 fall|_|23 asleep|_|03 in wearing|_|09 them .
it ’s a sad|_|02 day|_|05 when young|_|04 kids|_|05 are killing|_|02 themselves . they act|_|03 on impulse|_|05 and do not realize|_|03 that their actions|_|01 have lasting|_|02 consequences|_|02 . if someone|_|01 was just their to listen|_|02 to these kids|_|05 a lot|_|07 of this probably|_|01 would’t be happening|_|01 . its just so sad|_|02 especially|_|01 for the parents|_|02 and grandparents|_|01 but also|_|02 for the whole|_|02 family|_|02 .
hey , so i just read|_|03 about this fire|_|08 in arizona|_|02 . it was not super|_|03 serious|_|02 and no one|_|01 besides|_|01 one|_|01 person|_|01 needed|_|01 to go|_|01 to the hospital|_|02 . it was not like|_|02 super|_|03 tragic|_|01 but it just makes|_|03 me think|_|05 about my own life|_|03 . it also|_|02 makes|_|03 me really|_|01 think|_|05 about my living|_|06 situation|_|03 . i have never|_|02 thought|_|05 about how i live|_|01 in an apartment|_|01 building|_|07 shared|_|05 with several|_|01 other people|_|01 and that their actions|_|01 could have severe|_|01 consequences|_|03 . for example|_|04 , say|_|01 someone|_|01 above me has a child|_|03 who is playing|_|03 with the stove|_|02 and the parents|_|01 are unaware|_|01 . i fire|_|08 could start|_|08 and all of that is beyond|_|03 my control|_|02 . it really|_|01 freaks|_|01 me out now that i know|_|05 someone|_|01 besides|_|01 just myself could ruin|_|02 my home|_|01 or personal|_|01 belongings|_|01 . even|_|03 worse|_|01 , someone|_|01 could lose|_|03 their life|_|03 .
i read|_|02 an article|_|04 today|_|02 that was discussing|_|02 the problems|_|01 with sudan|_|02 in africa|_|01 . the article|_|04 was kind|_|01 of hard|_|12 to follow|_|02 , but it seems|_|02 like|_|02 there is a lot|_|05 of political|_|02 and peace|_|05 keeping|_|04 discourse|_|01 there . i really|_|01 feel|_|05 terrible|_|01 for all the innocent|_|07 people|_|03 that are caught|_|27 up in silly|_|01 power|_|04 plays|_|02 and government|_|02 issues|_|05 . people|_|03 's lives|_|02 are being ruined|_|02 and destroyed|_|02 every|_|02 day|_|01 .
there was just a 5.0 earthquake|_|02 in oklahoma|_|01 . fortunately|_|01 , no one|_|01 was badly|_|10 injured|_|01 . i did n't even|_|01 know|_|04 they had earthquakes|_|02 there . it must|_|01 be very scary|_|01 to have to go|_|03 through one|_|05 of those . i 'm glad|_|03 we do n't have them here . we used|_|03 to have drills|_|03 at school|_|05 , in the event|_|01 of an earthquake|_|02 , but that just seems|_|04 like|_|02 a waste|_|02 of time|_|05 . i 've never|_|01 even|_|01 been through one|_|05 .
did you hear|_|02 the story|_|03 about the orangutan|_|01 named|_|03 diana|_|02 ? she was illegally|_|01 captured|_|02 with , i think|_|02 , three|_|02 others . these animals|_|01 are becoming|_|01 extinct|_|03 . the good|_|01 news|_|02 is , though|_|01 , that she was saved|_|06 . when she was found|_|04 she was blind|_|01 and partially|_|01 paralyzed|_|01 , due|_|03 to meningitis|_|01 , i sure|_|07 because she was n't being taken|_|03 care|_|06 of . i do n't understand|_|03 how people|_|01 can treat|_|01 these beautiful|_|02 animals|_|01 so poorly|_|01 . it really|_|01 make|_|43 me sad|_|02 .
the research|_|01 team|_|02 from australia|_|01 ’s university|_|02 of queensland|_|01 said|_|01 the earth|_|04 has lost|_|07 nearly|_|03 1.3 million|_|01 square|_|05 miles|_|02 of wilderness|_|04 . they’be defined|_|03 wilderness|_|04 as an area|_|01 with no human|_|01 development|_|01 . dr.|_|04 james|_|09 watson|_|03 of the university|_|02 of queensland|_|01 in australia|_|01 said|_|01 globally|_|01 important|_|01 wilderness|_|04 areas|_|01 are completely|_|01 ignored|_|04 in environmental|_|02 policy|_|03 , and much|_|04 has been paid|_|10 to the loss|_|05 of species|_|01 . without any policies|_|03 to protect|_|02 them , they are “ falling|_|17 victim|_|02 to widespread|_|01 development|_|01 , ” he added|_|02 . dr.|_|04 watson|_|03 also|_|02 revealed|_|02 that humanity|_|08 has one|_|01 to two|_|01 decades|_|01 to turn|_|10 things|_|07 around|_|09 . to date|_|08 , the world|_|08 has a total|_|05 of 30.1 million|_|01 km2 , or around|_|09 20|_|01 percent|_|01 of the world|_|08 ’s land|_|04 area|_|01 , that remain|_|04 as wilderness|_|04 , with the majority|_|01 being located|_|01 in countries|_|02 in north|_|02 america|_|02 , north|_|02 asia|_|01 , australia|_|01 and north|_|02
it 's about time|_|03 ! i really|_|01 support|_|04 them doing this petition|_|01 . i hope|_|03 that they take|_|01 it seriously|_|01 and are able|_|04 to liberate|_|01 the saudi|_|01 women|_|02 who have been oppressed|_|01 for so long|_|01 . you would never|_|01 see|_|03 that kind|_|01 of ownership|_|03 / guardianship|_|02 system|_|05 in places|_|01 like|_|02 the united|_|05 states|_|01 . maybe|_|01 feminism|_|01 really|_|01 is sparking|_|04 change|_|06 around|_|07 the world|_|08 .
rhinos|_|01 are going|_|03 extinct|_|03 , and it s a real|_|03 shame|_|02 since they do nothing|_|01 to harm|_|01 human|_|03 life|_|01 . they are a majestic|_|01 creature|_|02 with much|_|01 to offer|_|02 . however|_|01 , they are being killed|_|09 because of poachers|_|03 and their horn|_|09 . the black|_|12 rhino|_|01 is almost|_|07 extinct|_|03 . only about five|_|01 thousand|_|01 still|_|01 exist|_|02 in the world|_|01 today|_|01 , and this is a real|_|03 shame|_|02 .

i just read|_|03 an article|_|04 about two|_|01 us|_|01 military|_|03 personals|_|01 being shot|_|03 in jordan|_|02 . i have so many|_|01 emotions|_|01 running|_|03 through me . i am sad|_|02 about the loss|_|01 of lives|_|06 . i am in disbelief|_|01 . how could this happen|_|01 ? the article|_|04 said|_|01 they do not believe|_|01 it was a roster|_|02 attack|_|05 so that makes|_|35 me feel|_|05 relieved|_|03 , but still|_|04 worried|_|06 . us|_|01 is there to assist|_|10 jordan|_|02 for training|_|01 . why our are people|_|03 being attacked|_|03 ? ! the article|_|04 said|_|01 they failed|_|04 to stop|_|03 at the entrance|_|03 so i do not know|_|05 if maybe|_|01 it was a miscommunication . i am confused|_|05 to what actually|_|02 happened|_|01 . from what i read|_|03 there was an attack|_|05 on jordan|_|02 when they just drove|_|02 and barreled|_|01 through their border|_|03 so they are on high|_|01 alert|_|02 . my heart|_|01 goes|_|03 out to all of those involved|_|01 and i am sad|_|02 . but why on earth|_|01 would they think|_|01 that the us|_|01 military|_|03 personal|_|01 are planning|_|03
hey , i wanted|_|05 to share|_|01 this article|_|04 with you that i just found|_|10 . it is about the issue|_|02 with junk|_|02 food|_|03 ads|_|01 and targeting|_|01 kids|_|02 . we were talking|_|02 about this the other day|_|01 . well|_|03 apparently|_|01 it will not be ending|_|04 any time|_|03 soon|_|01 . it is a billion|_|02 dollar|_|04 industry|_|01 and there is very little|_|08 anyone can do about it . there are organizations|_|05 out there that is trying|_|01 to prevent|_|02 this and fight|_|02 against childhood|_|01 obesity|_|01 . the who organization|_|05 is blaming|_|02 video|_|01 bloggers|_|01 / bloggers|_|01 who get|_|01 paychecks|_|01 from junk|_|02 food|_|03 companies|_|03 . they are claiming|_|05 that they are more powerful|_|01 than ads|_|01 . i 'm not sure|_|08 i believe|_|01 that but it could be possible|_|01 , you think|_|05 ?
i 'm always|_|02 upset|_|02 to hear|_|02 about violence|_|03 erupting|_|05 as a result|_|01 of lives|_|02 lost|_|11 due|_|01 to police|_|01 action|_|01 . i believe|_|01 most police|_|01 officers|_|01 are good|_|13 people|_|01 , but there is a pervasive|_|01 issue|_|02 of racism|_|02 ingrained|_|01 in many|_|01 police|_|01 departments|_|03 . the protests|_|01 were certainly|_|01 justified|_|05 . police|_|01 should be subjected|_|01 to psychological|_|02 testing|_|02 to determine|_|08 whether they have an inclination|_|03 toward racism|_|02 . those that do need|_|03 to be removed|_|01 from active|_|02 duty|_|01 immediately|_|03 .
i know|_|01 that you are an animal|_|01 lover|_|01 like|_|02 i am . it really|_|01 bothers|_|01 me that individuals|_|01 open|_|09 up zoos|_|02 and do n't really|_|01 care|_|01 about the animals|_|01 . it is wonderful|_|02 that an organization|_|05 was available|_|03 to take|_|01 these animals|_|01 out of the zoo|_|02 near|_|02 the gaza|_|01 strip|_|06 . i will not be going|_|03 to any zoos|_|02 anytime soon|_|01 . how about you ? animals|_|01 need|_|01 to be free|_|03 , not stared|_|03 at and yelled|_|02 at by little|_|03 children|_|03 . they deserve|_|01 space|_|02 . for now on when someone|_|01 asks|_|01 me to go|_|03 to a zoo|_|02 , my answer|_|02 is noon|_|01 !
global|_|01 warming|_|02 and fires|_|02 and now being considered|_|01 to be linked|_|02 to one|_|01 another|_|01 . while being a resident|_|01 of california|_|01 , this to me is not surprising|_|01 . unfortunately|_|01 we as a nation|_|04 need|_|02 to open|_|09 our eyes|_|05 up and realize|_|02 the impact|_|01 that we are having on our environment|_|02 . even|_|03 worse|_|01 is now we have a president|_|02 who in his|_|01 own words|_|01 feel|_|06 as though|_|01 global|_|01 warming|_|02 is just a fabrication|_|01 . this is going|_|15 to cost|_|02 us|_|01 more money|_|01 in the fire|_|02 fighting|_|02 department|_|03 and we are going|_|15 to see|_|01 way|_|06 worse|_|01 side|_|10 affects|_|05 from this problem|_|01 .
hello|_|01 friend|_|01 , have you read|_|06 this article|_|04 ? i think|_|02 you should , it 's quite|_|02 interesting|_|03 if i do say|_|01 so myself . it is about a representative|_|01 named|_|01 darrell issac , he is a republican|_|02 and has a southern|_|03 california|_|01 seat|_|06 . how great|_|03 would it be , to see|_|02 this massively|_|01 bad|_|01 man|_|08 lose|_|01 ? hopefully|_|02 , issac may|_|01 well|_|09 quote|_|03 mercuric|_|01 on november|_|01 8ht : “ ... ask|_|01 for me to - morrow|_|01 and you shall find|_|02 me a grave|_|03 man|_|08 . ”
i guess|_|02 people|_|03 do n't realize|_|02 how much|_|01 of an impact|_|01 they can have . the article|_|02 says|_|01 if people|_|03 would have done something they could have stopped|_|05 the extinction|_|06 of the animals|_|01 . but at the same time|_|02 , it is people|_|03 's action|_|01 indirectly|_|01 that caused|_|02 the extinction|_|06 , through contributing|_|01 to climate|_|02 change|_|03 . there is so much|_|01 that can go|_|04 out of balance|_|01 in nature|_|05 when people|_|03 are involved|_|02 . when one|_|03 species|_|01 dies|_|04 off , then everything in that ecosystem|_|01 changes|_|02 . i guess|_|02 the article|_|02 was kind|_|01 of interesting|_|01 . but what is the solution|_|05 the problem|_|01 they are talking|_|01 about ? how should people|_|03 intervene|_|01 to save|_|06 those animals|_|01 ?
there are a lot|_|05 of older|_|01 people|_|01 in russia|_|01 who survived|_|02 the second|_|01 world|_|01 war|_|01 who are now trying|_|01 their best|_|03 to survive|_|02 . many|_|01 estimates|_|02 say|_|01 that there are a lot|_|05 of people|_|01 in russia|_|01 who survived|_|02 only on $ 4.50 a day|_|01 . with this little|_|01 money|_|02 they do not have the luxury|_|01 of going|_|01 out to eat|_|02 . also|_|02 when living|_|02 on so little|_|01 money|_|02 it is dangerous|_|02 because of health|_|02 care|_|01 problems|_|01 . if one|_|05 has to have surgery|_|01 or even|_|03 get|_|01 expensive|_|01 medication|_|02 it can be a real|_|02 setback|_|03 to their life|_|01 style|_|01 . i hope|_|03 the russian|_|01 economy|_|04 becomes|_|01 better|_|01 enough|_|01 to support|_|09 it 's elderly|_|01 and everyone else|_|03 in the country|_|02 .
there 's something terrifying|_|01 about being attacked|_|05 by animals|_|01 . it 's even|_|03 more horrifying|_|02 to find|_|01 out the animals|_|01 that are attacking|_|05 you are the ones|_|01 you think|_|05 are so cute|_|02 and adorable|_|01 . i just read|_|06 an article|_|02 about squirrels|_|02 attacking|_|05 a retirement|_|01 home|_|01 and injuring|_|01 three|_|02 elderly|_|01 . it must|_|01 have been so terrifying|_|01 for them to encounter|_|10 this event|_|01 . imagine|_|02 going|_|01 out to feed|_|03 the squirrels|_|02 like|_|02 you usually|_|01 do and in turn|_|03 get|_|01 attacked|_|05 by these rabid|_|01 critters|_|01 ! it 's so shocking|_|01 and i 'm still|_|01 shaking|_|09 after reading|_|06 this . they had to call|_|02 in the ambulances|_|01 and animal|_|01 control|_|02 to help|_|01 the situation|_|02 out . this is tragic|_|01 . the bites|_|05 from the attack|_|09 could lead|_|03 to rabies|_|01 and other diseases|_|01 . i feel|_|05 troubled|_|01 thinking|_|01 about this because these elderly|_|01 ca|_|01 n't really|_|01 react|_|03 quick|_|01 enough|_|01 in these situations|_|02 .
i just read|_|08 about a car|_|02 crash|_|02 in prince|_|01 georges|_|07 county|_|02 , near|_|07 clinton|_|01 . it involved|_|01 three|_|01 vehicles|_|01 and it happened|_|04 at the tail|_|01 end|_|10 of rush|_|02 hour|_|04 . it said|_|11 that one|_|01 woman|_|01 was critically|_|01 injured|_|01 , but i wonder|_|03 if the passengers|_|01 in the other two|_|01 vehicles|_|01 were injured|_|01 . maryland|_|02 drivers|_|05 suck|_|04 . i avoid|_|02 anywhere|_|01 near|_|07 dc|_|01 since the roads|_|02 are not conducive|_|01 to safe|_|02 driving|_|08 .
i just read|_|03 this crazy|_|03 article|_|04 about wells|_|05 fargo|_|01 that i thought|_|03 i would share|_|02 with you . it turns|_|01 out that low|_|01 level|_|07 employees|_|01 were signing|_|07 people|_|03 up for products|_|01 and things|_|08 that they did not need|_|03 . sometimes|_|01 they were even|_|01 forging|_|01 signatures|_|04 to get|_|01 this done . now before you jump|_|02 to conclusions|_|05 and thin|_|05 k|_|01 that this is all the employees|_|01 fault|_|01 let|_|01 me fill|_|01 you in some more . management|_|02 came|_|04 up with a quota|_|02 and incentive|_|02 system|_|08 where employees(who do n't make|_|02 very good|_|13 money|_|03 to begin|_|07 with ) would make|_|02 extra|_|01 money|_|03 the more people|_|03 they signed|_|07 up to these new|_|01 accounts|_|03 . so basically|_|01 the people|_|03 in charge|_|03 over there thought|_|03 that it was a good|_|13 idea|_|01 to screw|_|02 over their account|_|03 holders|_|03 and give|_|03 their low|_|01 - level|_|07 employees|_|01 crazy|_|03 quotas|_|02 , all so they could make|_|02 more money|_|03 . then its the workers|_|02 getting|_|01 fired|_|03 .
hearing|_|02 this news|_|04 makes|_|03 me so sick|_|01 . the worst|_|01 thing|_|05 a person|_|01 can do is to hurt|_|02 a defenseless|_|02 animal|_|01 for no reason|_|02 . it 's so sickening|_|04 that someone|_|01 felt|_|01 the need|_|01 to senselessly|_|01 murder|_|03 one|_|02 of these amazing|_|01 horses|_|02 . it makes|_|03 me so sad|_|02 that this happened|_|04 , and i really|_|01 hope|_|03 the culprit|_|01 gets|_|02 brought|_|11 to justice|_|02 .
the tweets|_|01 attacked|_|01 her personally|_|05 , she explained|_|01 in a blog|_|01 post|_|09 on thursday|_|01 , and celebrated|_|06 the end|_|03 of “ mockingbird|_|01 . ” “ mockingbird|_|01 is canceled|_|01 , ” cain|_|01 had tweeted|_|01 early|_|01 last|_|01 week|_|01 . “ but we need|_|02 to make|_|02 sure|_|08 @marvel makes|_|02 room|_|02 for more titles|_|08 by women|_|02 about women|_|02 kicking|_|07 ass . ” she also|_|02 tweeted|_|01 out the cover|_|09 of the last|_|01 “ mockingbird|_|01 ” issue|_|04 and encouraged|_|03 followers|_|02 to buy|_|05 that issue|_|04 and “ send|_|01 a message|_|02 to @marvel that there ’s room|_|02 in comics|_|01 for super|_|03 her stories|_|03 about grown|_|01 - up women|_|02 .
boy|_|04 i ca|_|01 n't ever|_|01 imagine|_|02 being in a fire|_|09 like|_|02 these people|_|01 . first|_|01 your scared|_|01 about just trying|_|01 to get|_|01 out . then your looking|_|02 out for your neighbors|_|01 and their pets|_|01 . man|_|08 just tragic|_|01 really|_|01 tough|_|04 . now they have to find|_|05 somewhere|_|01 to stay|_|01 . just turns|_|20 your life|_|02 upside|_|02 down . paperwork|_|01 keepsakes|_|01 so hard|_|07 to get|_|01 over . even|_|03 if your not hurt|_|05 it must|_|01 affect|_|01 you for the rest|_|05 of your life|_|02 .
apparently|_|01 an actor|_|02 was found|_|02 dead|_|06 in a talk|_|03 show|_|01 host|_|01 's home|_|01 . not sure|_|04 what occurred|_|02 but you have to feel|_|05 sorry|_|01 for those close|_|02 to them . i certainly|_|01 do n't want|_|01 to be negative|_|03 and assume|_|09 that demons|_|03 finally|_|02 caught|_|03 up with him or an assault|_|02 of some sort|_|03 occurred|_|02 but it is odd|_|01 and they clearly|_|01 have family|_|06 who lost|_|01 a loved|_|02 one|_|01 . it a shame|_|02 that someone|_|01 with talent|_|02 to entertain|_|01 and act|_|03 would lose|_|01 their life|_|03 at a younger|_|01 age|_|01 and i guess|_|02 it could be any of us|_|01 but it 's sad|_|02 fur|_|03 those who knew|_|05 him and my heart|_|01 goes|_|01 out to them .
if people|_|01 are concerned|_|02 about others to where they feel|_|06 fear|_|01 . they need|_|01 to leave|_|01 the situation|_|01 entirely|_|02 . no working|_|01 things|_|01 out , no seeing|_|01 what happens|_|01 . if you feel|_|06 threatened|_|03 , leave|_|01 ! the problem|_|01 is most people|_|01 think|_|01 they ca|_|01 n't just drop|_|01 everything . but it 's mostly|_|01 because they either|_|01 do n't know|_|05 how , or do n't want|_|01 to live|_|05 any other lesser|_|01 lifestyle|_|01 than they are accustomed|_|02 to . kids|_|01 run|_|03 away|_|01 all the time|_|02 from home|_|01 with no skills|_|02 , or means|_|04 to get|_|01 by . many|_|01 of them end|_|01 up making|_|43 it out ok|_|01 . some do n't , but it 's usually|_|01 due|_|02 to making|_|43 the wrong|_|05 choices|_|02 . taking|_|06 the easy|_|03 way|_|05 out . we are free|_|03 to make|_|43 our own choices|_|02 , and live|_|05 the life|_|03 we can live|_|05 . so why would any one|_|01 ever|_|01 put|_|04 up with feeling|_|02 threatened|_|03 , when they can just leave|_|01 , and disappear|_|01 . even|_|01 if you have no where to go|_|03 , you can always|_|04 die|_|04 .
just found|_|05 this article|_|04 ; not surprised|_|01 by this at all . i ca|_|01 n't believe|_|01 there are truly|_|01 female|_|03 trump|_|02 voters|_|01 but i 'm not surprised|_|01 ; racism|_|02 is something they all bind|_|02 together|_|05 with . she really|_|01 should just leave|_|08 the party|_|05 if she actually|_|04 has any sense|_|02 . feel|_|01 free|_|01 to share|_|01 this with someone|_|01 else|_|03 as well|_|07 if you want|_|01 .
hey check|_|01 this out , you are a big|_|01 leonard|_|01 cohen fan|_|01 right|_|01 ? this is sad|_|01 , but this is life|_|05 . i often|_|03 think|_|09 about the deaths|_|04 of old|_|04 people|_|01 , should we be sad|_|01 ? should we celebrate|_|06 their life|_|05 ? what is the appropriate|_|01 emotion|_|01 to experience|_|05 at this point|_|23 . i know|_|05 i was sad|_|01 when my two|_|01 grand|_|06 fathers|_|01 died|_|03 , but that is personal|_|01 .
apparently|_|01 isis|_|01 is still|_|04 prevalent|_|01 in pakistan|_|01 .. there have been numerous|_|01 attacks|_|09 on the public|_|02 and a police|_|01 academy|_|04 . as bad|_|01 as this group|_|03 is for some reason|_|06 i do n't find|_|05 them to be that big|_|01 of a threat|_|03 to americans|_|01 . at least|_|01 not the ones|_|02 here at home|_|01 . by the way|_|01 was n't donald trump|_|02 suppose|_|02 to get|_|02 rid|_|01 of isis|_|01 completely|_|01 ?
hello|_|01 friends|_|01 i have just read|_|03 an article|_|04 about these people|_|03 from egypt|_|01 that were on a boat|_|01 and then they got|_|01 shipwrecked|_|04 i think|_|03 . the recent|_|01 scientist|_|01 of the earth|_|09 have no found|_|04 the evidence|_|02 about the ship|_|01 and the bodies|_|01 and are beginning|_|04 to make|_|35 ideas|_|01 up about the people|_|03 . they said|_|11 that the people|_|03 were on the ship|_|01 and i forgot|_|04 why or what they were doing but it is still|_|04 a little|_|05 bit|_|04 interesting|_|01 . the article|_|04 was very long|_|02 and hard|_|01 to read|_|03 though|_|01 .
hey , are n't you from the south|_|05 ? have you had any issues|_|02 with wildfires|_|01 in your area|_|02 ? there 's all this talk|_|02 about forest|_|01 fires|_|09 and droughts|_|02 in california|_|01 , but this is the first|_|02 time|_|02 i 've heard|_|02 about stuff|_|04 going|_|01 down in your area|_|02 . everything okay|_|01 down there ? make|_|01 sure|_|01 you stay|_|03 safe|_|02 ! i know|_|01 you do n't go|_|01 out much|_|04 , but it does n't take|_|01 much|_|01 to have a disaster|_|03 to fall|_|10 on your doorstep|_|01 .
it does n't matter|_|02 what country|_|04 you live|_|11 in . the powerful|_|01 will always|_|04 stomp|_|01 on the weak|_|12 . expecting|_|04 anything from your government|_|02 or your party|_|04 is pointless|_|01 unless you have some amount|_|02 of influence|_|05 . politics|_|05 have not stopped|_|01 war|_|04 , poverty|_|01 , disease|_|01 , crime|_|02 , or anything else|_|01 . it simply|_|01 is a way|_|11 to subjugate|_|01 mass|_|03 amounts|_|02 of people|_|03 no differently|_|01 than in olden|_|01 times|_|03 . they keep|_|02 painting|_|03 a pretty|_|02 picture|_|01 , and we all live|_|11 in this illusion|_|02 that life|_|01 can be great|_|01 here or there . but that is because there is not enough|_|02 focus|_|01 on the horrible|_|03 things|_|05 happening|_|02 under our noses|_|05 , even|_|03 in our own neighborhoods|_|01 . people|_|03 are wretched|_|01 , and those who rise|_|08 to power|_|01 will continue|_|02 to be the most retched|_|01 as they sell|_|03 themselves out to any donor|_|02 , or support|_|06 that will keep|_|02 them in power|_|01 .
i would feel|_|05 absolutely|_|01 horrible|_|03 to be in any of these parents|_|02 shoes|_|02 , i feel|_|05 like|_|02 they probably|_|01 think|_|11 they are completely|_|01 lost|_|03 , anxious|_|02 , deserted|_|03 . i would be a complete|_|01 mess|_|01 . i font|_|01 know|_|05 exactly|_|01 what i would do in that situation|_|02 . i feel|_|05 like|_|02 the chances|_|02 are good|_|17 enough|_|01 for them to try|_|01 for that second|_|01 baby|_|04 but i do understand|_|02 them not wanting|_|01 to try|_|01 because of the small|_|01 chances|_|02 of the other one|_|01 having the erika virus|_|03 anyways|_|01 .
the person|_|01 that rented|_|01 out the apartment|_|01 i feel|_|02 was in the wrong|_|02 doing because they dint|_|01 own the place|_|01 so when the damages|_|02 came|_|04 it he wast able|_|01 to fix|_|12 the problems|_|01 making|_|02 it the owners|_|02 problem|_|01 which led|_|03 to them finding|_|03 out and having to file|_|05 the law|_|01 suite|_|02 for 20k to get|_|01 there money|_|03 back|_|06 so it was a messy|_|01 situation|_|02
yuck . although i do n't think|_|02 you can say|_|01 it was particularly|_|01 disturbing|_|11 for women|_|01 because a lot|_|05 of women|_|01 voted|_|03 for the misogynistic|_|01 ass . the real|_|03 problem|_|01 was reasonable|_|03 people|_|01 did n't bother|_|01 to vote|_|03 . i did . and after the election|_|01 news|_|01 i was so depressed|_|02 , i stayed|_|05 home|_|09 and drank|_|02 wine|_|02 that day|_|10 . i did n't have to work|_|03 .
i just read|_|03 this article|_|04 about a really|_|01 bad|_|01 accident|_|02 that happened|_|01 at a water|_|01 park|_|06 . apparently|_|01 , the ride|_|02 malfunctioned|_|01 and threw|_|02 some kids|_|01 from the ride|_|02 and the parents|_|02 were stuck|_|01 in the raft|_|01 and they were stuck|_|01 underwater|_|01 and were hitting|_|01 the machinery|_|02 below . everyone kept|_|02 talking|_|02 about how horrific|_|02 it was and what a terrible|_|01 tragedy|_|02 it was . i feel|_|05 really|_|01 bad|_|01 for these people|_|01 and it really|_|01 makes|_|01 you wonder|_|02 if you should go|_|01 to a park|_|06 ever|_|03 again . you 're suppose|_|02 to have fun|_|02 at these places|_|01 but you never|_|01 really|_|01 ever|_|03 think|_|03 about actually|_|02 getting|_|01 hurt|_|06 when you get|_|01 on these rides|_|02 . those poor|_|06 people|_|01 , they just wanted|_|01 to have a nice|_|03 afternoon|_|01 and it just ended|_|04 so badly|_|05 .
hey , josh|_|02 have you seen|_|10 this ? world|_|01 currencies|_|01 are going|_|03 to be taking|_|06 a hit|_|03 , i just wanted|_|05 to let|_|02 you know|_|03 . the complete|_|05 misunderstanding|_|01 of how to run|_|11 something as simple|_|07 as a bank|_|10 multiplied|_|02 by thousands|_|01 around|_|07 the country|_|04 of india|_|01 is bringing|_|04 that country|_|04 to its knees|_|01 . we see|_|10 this happen|_|01 all the time|_|02 where markets|_|01 are controlled|_|10 by the government|_|02 and something stagnates|_|03 then we add|_|01 more controls|_|11 and now we have a depression|_|01 .
so three|_|02 missiles|_|01 get|_|03 shot|_|02 up in the air|_|01 randomly|_|01 like|_|02 if this were to be a daily|_|01 routine|_|04 . nobody|_|04 was going|_|01 to do anything about it . the craziest|_|01 part|_|01 about it is reading|_|09 about the father|_|01 who the article|_|01 states|_|01 that jokingly|_|01 told|_|01 his|_|01 family|_|01 to forgive|_|02 him if he did not return|_|01 home|_|07 that night|_|04 . that man|_|10 did not return|_|01 home|_|07 that i find|_|02 insane|_|01 .
wow|_|02 , just wow|_|02 . i think|_|10 that the possibility|_|02 of nominating|_|02 this judge|_|01 for the supreme|_|01 court|_|08 really|_|01 needs|_|02 to be reexamined|_|01 closely|_|01 in that this nomination|_|02 could cause|_|02 bigger|_|13 problems|_|01 and chaos|_|04 across|_|01 the country|_|04 . there would be heavy|_|08 debates|_|02 and fights|_|05 from both sides|_|06 and in the end|_|07 , there unfortunately|_|01 would be no progress|_|03 .
while i obviously|_|01 think|_|03 that it is sad|_|02 that an animal|_|01 is dead|_|01 since i love|_|01 animals|_|01 , what i mostly|_|01 feel|_|05 reading|_|06 this story|_|03 is aggravation|_|03 . it really|_|01 annoys|_|01 and worries|_|02 me that people|_|01 insist|_|01 climate|_|02 change|_|04 is a political|_|03 issue|_|01 when we can see|_|05 its effects|_|03 everywhere|_|01 , including|_|02 in the form|_|01 of the current|_|01 extinction|_|04 crisis|_|01 . i know|_|05 that this particular|_|02 one|_|01 was due|_|02 to a fungus|_|01 , but it is part|_|01 of a trend|_|01 and might|_|01 be related|_|01 , so that is what this makes|_|43 me think|_|03 of . i always|_|04 feel|_|05 frustrated|_|02 and worried|_|01 about the future|_|03 whenever i am reminded|_|01 that extinctions|_|04 like|_|02 this and other problems|_|01 are just going|_|05 to keep|_|02 happening|_|04 because conservatives|_|01 refuse|_|06 to acknowledge|_|04 that the problem|_|01 even|_|01 exists|_|02 . it could be fixed|_|12 , but probably|_|01 wo n't be , and that irritates|_|01 me .
i really|_|01 think|_|10 everyone should read|_|03 this article|_|04 . this story|_|03 shows|_|08 perfectly|_|02 how damaging|_|02 and dangerous|_|01 guns|_|01 can be to all people|_|01 on both sides|_|01 of the law|_|01 . this is why this country|_|04 needs|_|01 to make|_|08 it harder|_|03 for everyone to be able|_|04 to obtain|_|02 a gun|_|01 . this is especially|_|01 true|_|01 to those who have been involved|_|01 in domestic|_|05 and sexual|_|02 abuse|_|01 incidents|_|02 .
overall|_|02 the problem|_|01 here seems|_|02 to be that overuse|_|01 of resources|_|02 in a certain|_|01 area|_|06 needs|_|02 to be stopped|_|01 . simply|_|04 pumping|_|08 more water|_|02 is n't the issue|_|02 and perhaps|_|01 the fact|_|03 that too many|_|01 people|_|03 are trying|_|01 to use|_|01 that water|_|02 source|_|04 should be something that 's looked|_|02 into . there should also|_|02 be some sort|_|04 of testing|_|01 and filtering|_|01 system|_|03 put|_|01 into place|_|01 to protect|_|02 the people|_|03 .
remember|_|02 that story|_|01 that i told|_|03 you about my neighbor|_|02 paul|_|02 from my old|_|03 neighborhood|_|01 and how he had served|_|01 in iraq|_|01 and had come|_|04 home|_|07 and had potsdam|_|01 ? i found|_|02 this article|_|04 that explains|_|02 it pretty|_|01 good|_|21 and think|_|02 you might|_|01 be interested|_|01 in reading|_|03 it to deal|_|02 with the new|_|05 coworker that you have that has similar|_|04 issues|_|02 .
it is about time|_|06 that for profit|_|01 education|_|05 has had the breaks|_|02 put|_|02 on them . provide|_|02 a substandard|_|03 education|_|05 at the students|_|01 and government|_|02 's expense|_|01 in unconscionable|_|01 . they should have been shut|_|02 down years|_|03 earlier|_|01 . there are so many|_|01 cheaper|_|04 and better|_|13 alternatives|_|02 to obtaining|_|02 and education|_|05 . i do n't feel|_|05 sorry|_|01 for them
i feel|_|05 bad|_|09 for that baby|_|01 . the way|_|11 it sounds|_|01 , especially|_|01 with the bottle|_|03 of milk|_|01 being in there , it sounds|_|01 like|_|02 someone|_|01 had the baby|_|01 and could n't keep|_|02 it so they left|_|02 it there . i wish|_|02 people|_|01 would use|_|01 the fire|_|09 station|_|01 safe|_|04 haven option|_|02 . i thought|_|05 it was interesting|_|01 that they mentioned|_|01 that a 14|_|01 year|_|02 old|_|01 heard|_|04 the cries|_|01 . i wonder|_|02 if the 14|_|01 year|_|02 old|_|01 was the one|_|02 who had the baby|_|01 and had to hide|_|02 it .
a guy|_|03 named|_|03 collins|_|01 was charged|_|02 with stealing|_|03 nude|_|01 celebrity|_|01 photos|_|01 and videos|_|01 . while his|_|01 behavior|_|01 is clearly|_|01 unacceptable|_|03 , one|_|06 thing|_|08 to note|_|04 is the article|_|02 is calling|_|20 this a hack|_|01 . hacking|_|01 and nothing|_|01 is safe|_|03 , not you , not yours , not your loved|_|02 ones|_|02 , is kind|_|01 of a way|_|11 to make|_|08 people|_|01 afraid|_|02 and keep|_|06 reading|_|02 . in reality|_|03 , this guy|_|03 just kinda|_|02 sent|_|02 an email|_|01 to these celebrities|_|01 and said|_|01 hey i need|_|03 your password|_|01 this is google|_|01 from google|_|01 , hurry|_|03 its an emergency|_|01 and they fell|_|08 for it . i feel|_|05 bad|_|01 for them , we 've all been tricked|_|01 at least|_|01 once in our lives|_|13 by something on the internet|_|01 , but it is n't like|_|02 this guy|_|03 cracked|_|08 the security|_|03 of google|_|01 and we 're all doomed|_|03 .
this is the kind|_|01 of stuff|_|06 that happens|_|01 all over and is always|_|01 under reported|_|04 because the perpetrators|_|01 of such sexual|_|02 harassment|_|02 and assaults|_|03 are protected|_|02 by their power|_|02 in society|_|02 and other powerful|_|01 people|_|03 . it was long|_|01 just an unspoken|_|01 or open|_|02 secret|_|01 that everyone basically|_|01 knew|_|01 , but it 's good|_|01 that it 's finally|_|01 coming|_|04 to light|_|13 with people|_|03 willing|_|01 to speak|_|03 up , especially|_|01 the victims|_|02 . if they did n't speak|_|03 up , people|_|03 would go|_|03 on thinking|_|01 that this kind|_|01 of stuff|_|06 only happens|_|01 in tv|_|01 and movies|_|01 . art|_|02 imitates|_|02 life|_|01 , and vice|_|02 avers|_|01 .
so the police|_|01 found|_|02 this woman|_|02 wondering|_|02 the streets|_|03 in philadelphia|_|01 at 1|_|01 am with no coat|_|01 on in the cold|_|01 . she was in some kind|_|01 of daze|_|01 , probably|_|01 alzheimer 's or something . anyways|_|01 , their trying|_|01 to identify|_|01 her . it would suck|_|02 to be in that state|_|02 of mind|_|01 . sounds|_|02 horrible|_|03 and potentially|_|01 scary|_|01 if your cognizant|_|01 enough|_|01 .
well|_|12 toughie|_|03 the frog|_|01 died|_|01 . he was in a zoo|_|02 . he was twelve|_|01 years|_|03 old|_|01 at least|_|01 . they say|_|01 he was older|_|01 since he was caught|_|21 as an adult|_|01 . i wonder|_|03 what gave|_|01 him such a long|_|01 life|_|05 . they do n't live|_|11 long|_|02 around|_|01 here where i live|_|11 . i can not imagine|_|02 a frog|_|01 living|_|06 that long|_|02 . that 's as long|_|02 as a dog|_|01 almost|_|07 . i hope|_|02 they earned|_|08 a great|_|01 deal|_|06 from him .
i saw|_|01 some heartbreaking|_|02 news|_|01 and i could not believe|_|01 it . why would defenseless|_|02 and innocent|_|07 people|_|01 be killed|_|01 over something that they did not do or had no involvement|_|01 with ? i will never|_|01 understand|_|04 why some things|_|08 in this world|_|08 are the way|_|01 that they are . there needs|_|02 to be change|_|06 but sadly|_|01 i do not think|_|01 we will see|_|05 it soon|_|01 .
it 's really|_|01 unfortunate|_|03 that north|_|04 korea|_|01 does n't seem|_|04 able|_|04 to help|_|01 their citizens|_|01 during a natural|_|06 disaster|_|03 . hopefully|_|02 some other country|_|01 is willing|_|01 to step|_|10 up and offer|_|05 assistance|_|02 , although i do n't know|_|10 how that works|_|03 since they do n't really|_|01 let|_|01 people|_|01 in . it must|_|01 be pretty|_|01 devastating|_|01 if they are resorting|_|03 to asking|_|01 for outside|_|03 help|_|02 .
" i had heard|_|01 about the huge|_|01 fires|_|09 burning|_|01 in the indonesia|_|01 area|_|01 and the haze|_|01 clouds|_|04 they are producing|_|03 but i did n't realize|_|02 it was so bad|_|09 . apparently|_|01 there is a statistical|_|01 study|_|01 that says|_|09 100,000 people|_|01 have been killed|_|01 by this . the researchers|_|01 tried|_|01 to count|_|06 " " early|_|01 deaths|_|08 " " and got|_|01 that figure|_|04 . i suspect|_|03 the root|_|04 problem|_|01 is corruption|_|06 . some of the business|_|01 owners|_|01 in indonesia|_|01 and malaysia|_|01 are extremely|_|01 rich|_|01 and can act|_|03 with impunity|_|01 , even|_|03 though|_|01 their actions|_|10 cause|_|02 great|_|02 harm|_|01 to the environment|_|02 and to humans|_|02 near|_|01 and far|_|03 . maybe|_|01 they should be charged|_|03 with crimes|_|02 for the deaths|_|08 . on the other hand|_|06 i dislike|_|01 the idea|_|03 of people|_|01 being convicted|_|01 of crimes|_|02 via statistical|_|01 analysis|_|02 . it is too easy|_|03 to manipulate|_|05 . "
i think|_|02 almost|_|07 everyone has an opinion|_|01 on hilary clinton|_|04 over donald trump|_|02 . many|_|01 did n't expect|_|01 donald to win|_|01 the election|_|01 but here we are . so many|_|01 political|_|02 scandals|_|02 unfolded|_|02 and more continuing|_|02 to unravel|_|01 . many|_|01 did n't agree|_|01 with hilary from the benghazi|_|01 investigation|_|01 and many|_|01 did n't agree|_|01 with trump|_|02 , but in the end|_|11 that 's just politics|_|04 .
it 's not pleasant|_|02 to think|_|11 of these animals|_|01 being mistreated|_|01 , but for all the problems|_|01 in the world|_|08 something like|_|02 this seems|_|02 rather|_|02 minor|_|10 . of course|_|04 it would be great|_|01 to ensure|_|10 good|_|12 keeping|_|04 of animals|_|01 , but there are more pressing|_|05 tragedies|_|01 happening|_|03 much|_|05 more often|_|05 to human|_|03 beings that we should focus|_|02 on before addressing|_|05 these issues|_|02 of occasional|_|02 animal|_|01 mus|_|01 - handling|_|01 .
the reason|_|03 why they 're killing|_|08 people|_|01 over there is because the allied|_|01 forces|_|08 are occupying|_|02 their country|_|04 . if only we would keep|_|04 our nose|_|04 out of others ' business|_|01 , then maybe|_|01 , just maybe|_|01 the world|_|08 would become|_|04 a better|_|04 place|_|06 . but as with all empires|_|02 ( and america|_|01 is no different|_|01 ) , they eventually|_|01 fall|_|26 because of internal|_|03 forces|_|08 .
that would be a scary|_|01 situation|_|01 to live|_|01 in . it is sad|_|02 that the people|_|01 feel|_|05 like|_|02 the government|_|02 cares|_|02 more about the elephants|_|02 and animals|_|01 than the people|_|01 . these people|_|01 must|_|01 learn|_|02 how to live|_|01 with the elephants|_|02 , but it seems|_|02 like|_|02 it is a scary|_|01 thing|_|01 to do . i would hate|_|01 to try|_|01 and live|_|01 in that situation|_|01 with children|_|03 . i also|_|02 think|_|03 that anyone who is going|_|03 to visit|_|08 there should be made|_|43 aware|_|01 of the dangers|_|02 of the elephants|_|02 so that they do n't get|_|01 injured|_|01 or killed|_|01 like|_|02 the 29|_|01 year|_|03 old|_|01 woman|_|02 did in the article|_|04 .
hey ! so i just read|_|06 this article|_|04 about the internet|_|01 in schools|_|05 . i guess|_|02 that several|_|01 years|_|03 ago|_|01 , the government|_|02 came|_|04 up with this program|_|07 to get|_|01 internet|_|01 and technology|_|01 in to schools|_|05 and make|_|02 it possible|_|01 for as many|_|01 or all students|_|01 to have access|_|04 to computers|_|01 and the internet|_|01 . however|_|04 , according|_|01 to this article|_|04 , this program|_|07 is not working|_|01 the way|_|11 that it was set|_|12 up to work|_|01 and students|_|01 are not actually|_|01 benefiting|_|01 from this program|_|07 that costs|_|02 a lot|_|02 of money|_|03 ! i was upset|_|01 to read|_|06 this , as i feel|_|05 that the internet|_|01 can be such a valuable|_|02 tool|_|02 in education|_|03 , but then i really|_|01 was n't surprised|_|02 at all to learn|_|04 that the government|_|02 is n't doing what it has been set|_|12 up to do or what it is promising|_|01 us|_|01 citizens|_|01 it will do . does n't the government|_|02 just infuriate|_|01 you and make|_|02 you think|_|02 you could do better|_|13 ?
i 'm glad|_|03 germany|_|01 is trying|_|08 to help|_|06 a lot|_|05 of refugees|_|01 when other countries|_|04 ( ahem|_|02 the us|_|01 ) are trying|_|08 to get|_|02 out of helping|_|06 people|_|01 . however|_|01 if they 're going|_|03 to have that reputation|_|01 they need|_|01 to be prepared|_|01 to deal|_|03 with the number|_|01 of individuals|_|01 who will try|_|08 to come|_|04 . it feels|_|05 like|_|02 so many|_|01 of the problems|_|01 these refugees|_|01 are running|_|03 from have been created|_|03 at some point|_|20 due|_|02 to us|_|01 / european|_|01 colonization|_|01 and intervention|_|02 , so i 'm glad|_|03 they 're at least|_|01 trying|_|08 .
cricket|_|02 players|_|01 in england|_|01 are likely|_|01 going|_|02 to have trouble|_|04 sleeping|_|02 after a 4ht day|_|05 of the first|_|05 test|_|02 . being in their shoes|_|02 , playing|_|01 hard|_|01 and working|_|09 together|_|03 is the key|_|09 to beating|_|01 bangladesh|_|01 and they need|_|01 to stay|_|09 on top|_|04 of their game|_|09 in order|_|01 to win|_|01 . while it 's physically|_|01 demanding|_|01 , giving|_|20 up or blaming|_|03 lack|_|01 of sleep|_|03 is simply|_|03 not an option|_|02 for the team|_|02 .
i just read|_|06 a horrible|_|03 article|_|02 online|_|03 about 10|_|01 people|_|01 getting|_|01 hurt|_|06 after a huge|_|01 fire|_|03 started|_|06 in an apartment|_|01 complex|_|03 in arizona|_|02 . that is so horrible|_|03 i really|_|01 feel|_|03 bad|_|01 for them . the say|_|01 that eight|_|01 of the people|_|01 had minor|_|08 injuries|_|01 so that is good|_|01 that it was only minor|_|08 . unfortunately|_|01 one|_|05 person|_|01 had to be taken|_|01 to the hospital|_|02 but they are in stable|_|01 condition|_|01 so that is good|_|01 news|_|01 . apparently|_|01 two|_|01 people|_|01 outside|_|01 of the apartment|_|01 were also|_|02 hurt|_|06 by the fire|_|03 some how . i think|_|05 they were able|_|01 to get|_|01 the fire|_|03 under control|_|02 pretty|_|02 easily|_|03 though|_|01 cause|_|02 it only lasted|_|01 around|_|01 10|_|01 minutes|_|02 . they had to have the gas|_|02 company|_|03 come|_|01 and shut|_|02 off the gas|_|02 and apparently|_|01 they are investigating|_|02 what could have caused|_|02 the fire|_|03 in the first|_|01 place|_|01 . that reminds|_|01 me of the fire|_|03 that happened|_|01 at my neighbors|_|01 house|_|01 .
i just read|_|06 an article|_|04 about a father|_|01 who killed|_|01 his|_|01 daughter|_|01 's adoptive|_|01 grandfather|_|01 because he had molested|_|01 her and got|_|14 off with a light|_|04 sentence|_|01 . its crazy|_|01 . i mean|_|03 , i can see|_|01 why he would snap|_|01 , if you can call|_|03 it that , but .. i font|_|01 know|_|01 . my feelings|_|02 are all over the place|_|01 . if someone|_|01 hurt|_|02 my kids|_|02 i could see|_|01 imagining|_|02 killing|_|01 thyme|_|02 , but i doubt|_|02 i could acct on it . and there are all these people|_|01 cheering|_|05 his|_|01 actions|_|01 . like|_|02 he has this weird|_|01 fan|_|01 club|_|02 for doing it . his|_|01 life|_|01 is ruined|_|01 , his|_|01 daughter|_|01 is a mess|_|02 dealing|_|03 with the guilt|_|02 of it all , someone|_|01 is dead|_|01 . and it said|_|01 on the way|_|06 to kill|_|01 the old|_|07 man|_|08 , he shot|_|11 at an old|_|07 boyfriend|_|01 of hers he suspected|_|03 was abusive|_|02 . i d , maybe|_|01 the heat|_|04 of the moment|_|06 since he already|_|01 decided|_|03 he was going|_|16 to jail|_|01 for murder|_|01 . just such an emotional|_|06 read|_|01
this is absolutely|_|02 awful|_|01 . i ca|_|01 n't even|_|01 imagine|_|02 the amount|_|01 of pain|_|02 the victim|_|02 had . the only suspected|_|02 motive|_|01 was after communal|_|01 rejected|_|04 the sexual|_|04 advances|_|03 of one|_|06 of the men|_|01 inside|_|01 the apartment|_|01 ? really|_|01 ? that 's not a good|_|13 reason|_|03 at all to kill|_|09 someone|_|01 . how dare|_|01 he . what a tragic|_|01 story|_|03 this is , and it makes|_|02 me heart|_|03 churn|_|01 just trying|_|01 to think|_|03 of the robbed|_|01 life|_|01 that was taken|_|06 .
i think|_|01 parents|_|01 complaining|_|02 about their preteen|_|01 children|_|02 are overreacting|_|01 . just deal|_|06 with it and everything will be okay|_|01 . you ca|_|01 n't place|_|01 them in a toy|_|01 box|_|09 anymore|_|01 or sit|_|01 them in front|_|09 of the tv|_|01 and tell|_|05 them to sit|_|01 and watch|_|06 it until it 's done . i 'm not worried|_|02 about this because i have no kids|_|02 of my own and i could care|_|02 less|_|02 .

i think|_|10 with all the social|_|04 media|_|02 and news|_|02 stories|_|03 , recent|_|03 incidents|_|01 involving|_|01 terror|_|04 attacks|_|05 , and those who are of a different|_|01 race|_|03 commuting|_|01 these acts|_|02 , especially|_|01 since the 9/11|_|01 attack|_|05 this will always|_|02 be an issue|_|02 with people|_|03 because we are just alarmed|_|02 , even|_|01 though|_|01 some may|_|01 have nothing|_|01 to do with terrorism|_|01 or any type|_|05 of situation|_|01 regarding|_|05 that but they will always|_|02 be perceived|_|02 that way|_|01 because of what happened|_|03 in the past|_|02 . it 's probably|_|01 not right|_|04 of those who are discriminating|_|03 and the airlines|_|02 really|_|01 need|_|03 to do something about all the complaints|_|04 .
what an awful|_|01 tragedy|_|02 no family|_|01 should be subjected|_|01 to this . this is really|_|01 getting|_|01 out of hand|_|14 i ca|_|01 nt|_|01 believe|_|01 the middle|_|03 east|_|05 still|_|01 has so much|_|01 turmoil|_|02 . its really|_|01 ridiculous|_|03 . i hope|_|02 our boys|_|01 can help|_|01 calm|_|01 the situation|_|01 and keep|_|02 things|_|01 safer|_|02 than they are now . its just insane|_|01 how much|_|01 a person|_|01 must|_|01 be delusional|_|01 to go|_|16 through with these actions|_|10
while reading|_|03 this article|_|04 all i could think|_|13 of is how much|_|01 of a shame|_|02 and alarming|_|02 it is of the recent|_|03 shootings|_|02 that have been taking|_|03 place|_|01 all over the usa|_|01 . i know|_|01 we have talked|_|02 about guns|_|02 and ownership|_|01 in the past|_|01 , but i 'm starting|_|02 to think|_|13 it is important|_|01 to look|_|02 at what we can do to stop|_|05 these acts|_|02 and how we can make|_|02 a change|_|01 ourselves . i also|_|02 was surprised|_|02 that they did not try|_|01 to take|_|03 the story|_|03 and flip|_|10 it into being some type|_|06 of political|_|01 debate|_|02 about how the shooter|_|05 was made|_|02 about politics|_|04 or a race|_|03 war|_|04 .
i just do n't understand|_|02 russia|_|01 . i mean|_|04 they seem|_|04 to be a country|_|02 that is civilized|_|03 , right|_|01 ? how is it that they so openly|_|01 support|_|03 terrorism|_|01 ? i just do n't understand|_|02 how they stand|_|10 with syria|_|01 and are ok|_|01 with all of the horrible|_|03 things|_|08 that are happening|_|01 there . i think|_|02 if russia|_|01 actually|_|02 stood|_|10 up for what is right|_|08 , the world|_|03 would be a much|_|04 better|_|13 place|_|01 .
hey you hear|_|02 about the coffee|_|01 killer|_|01 ? in indonesia|_|01 some chick|_|01 who is also|_|02 australian|_|01 has been found|_|02 guilty|_|02 of killing|_|01 her friend|_|01 by putting|_|04 cyanide|_|01 in her coffee|_|01 . i did not get|_|02 too many|_|01 details|_|03 about all of the evidence|_|03 that they have against her but to me at least|_|01 it does not seem|_|03 like|_|02 they have that much|_|01 evidence|_|03 . i guess|_|02 she ordered|_|01 her friend|_|01 a coffee|_|01 before her friend|_|01 got|_|02 there and right|_|04 after she took|_|29 a sip|_|01 of the coffee|_|01 she keeled|_|01 over and died|_|04 . pretty|_|01 crazy|_|03 , right|_|08 ? i think|_|03 she probably|_|01 did it but their motive|_|01 is weak|_|04 and i do not think|_|03 that she would have been found|_|02 guilty|_|02 if the trial|_|04 was going|_|01 on in the us|_|01 .
that is nice|_|03 . isis|_|01 is using|_|01 chemical|_|01 weapons|_|02 against us|_|01 now ? what is the world|_|08 coming|_|04 to , and how much|_|01 longer|_|01 are we going|_|03 to put|_|04 our military|_|03 out there for this ? especially|_|01 now that they are being exposed|_|03 to chemicals|_|01 that can burn|_|01 the skin|_|06 , and due|_|03 some bad|_|09 damage|_|02 . this does n't does n't seem|_|04 right|_|04 at all .
banking|_|01 a banking|_|01 company|_|03 in spain|_|01 had their board|_|01 members|_|01 spend|_|03 unauthorized|_|01 private|_|05 money|_|03 from the bank|_|02 on hotels|_|01 , entertainment|_|01 food|_|02 , and other luxuries|_|03 . all this was spent|_|03 from credit|_|04 cards|_|01 used|_|02 by the bank|_|02 itself . the spending|_|01 was unauthorized|_|01 and not reported|_|04 to the tax|_|01 authorities|_|01 at all . banking|_|01 was already|_|01 in the limelight|_|02 already|_|01 due|_|01 to being bailed|_|05 out by the government|_|01 in 13|_|01 million|_|01 dollars|_|02 .
the native|_|03 american|_|01 have been through so much|_|01 already|_|01 to try|_|01 to keep|_|02 just a small|_|04 part|_|03 of the land|_|04 that they called|_|24 their own and slow|_|04 but surely|_|01 they continue|_|03 to lose|_|01 a battle|_|01 against the usa|_|01 government|_|02 . it seems|_|02 as though|_|01 it is just a very period|_|01 of time|_|03 before the only place|_|12 to find|_|02 native|_|03 americans|_|01 with be in the lying|_|03 pages|_|06 of our school|_|05 books|_|02 .
this is sad|_|02 that a company|_|01 that is based|_|01 here in the us|_|01 and that actually|_|02 manufacturers|_|02 its products|_|05 in the us|_|01 is in debt|_|03 . more effort|_|01 should have been placed|_|03 to ensure|_|02 company|_|01 's success|_|03 . more companies|_|01 should be encouraged|_|03 to manufacture|_|04 their products|_|05 in our country|_|04 while also|_|02 making|_|02 them affordable|_|01 and appealing|_|02 .
poor|_|01 man|_|02 , he had lot|_|04 of success|_|01 to get|_|14 and more working|_|01 plans|_|03 in his|_|01 life|_|01 and could n't achieve|_|01 them because of his|_|01 sudden|_|01 death|_|05 , at least|_|01 his|_|01 dead|_|02 was natural|_|09 , i guess|_|02 , because that is n't specified|_|01 in the article|_|04 . my deepest|_|01 condolences|_|01 to his|_|01 friends|_|05 and family|_|08 members|_|01 , he will be missed|_|01 in the comedians|_|02 community|_|01 .
it 's good|_|13 that they did n't have to hurt|_|06 the emu|_|02 . every|_|02 time|_|02 i hear|_|02 about one|_|05 of these animal|_|01 escapes|_|05 i get|_|02 the feeling|_|01 that someone|_|01 is going|_|01 to end|_|01 up killing|_|02 the animal|_|01 ; i expect|_|01 either|_|01 an officer|_|04 with legal|_|05 authority|_|07 or some stupid|_|01 maniac|_|02 with a gun|_|02 who wants|_|01 to kill|_|02 something exotic|_|02 is going|_|01 to end|_|01 up shooting|_|11 it . i thought|_|06 i saw|_|01 a wild|_|01 bird|_|02 like|_|01 run|_|01 across|_|02 the road|_|02 one|_|05 morning|_|01 when i was driving|_|03 to work|_|01 . it was n't big|_|11 enough|_|01 to be an emu|_|02 but it was similar|_|01 . i was worried|_|06 that someone|_|01 was going|_|01 to kill|_|02 it , whatever|_|01 it was .
i can not stand|_|08 donald trump|_|02 and his|_|01 fear|_|03 mongering|_|01 . most muslim|_|01 people|_|01 i know|_|01 are very , very kind|_|01 people|_|01 . it is so unfortunate|_|01 there are so many|_|01 hate|_|01 crimes|_|02 because of the ignorance|_|01 our president|_|02 continues|_|02 to blast|_|02 on twitter|_|01 . it 's not just muslims|_|01 . it 's everyone that is not part|_|09 of the alt|_|03 - white|_|08 movement|_|10 . jewish|_|01 people|_|01 , lente|_|01 people|_|01 . black|_|01 people|_|01 . it is fueled|_|04 by hate|_|01 and ignorance|_|01 . trumps|_|02 muslim|_|01 ban|_|02 did more harm|_|01 than good|_|07 ! he just caused|_|01 fear|_|01 , creating|_|03 a deeper|_|07 divide|_|01 in our country|_|04 . it 's sad|_|01 .
looks|_|03 like|_|02 india|_|01 and pakistani|_|01 relations|_|01 are going|_|01 straight|_|04 to hell|_|04 . it is unclear|_|02 if it was really|_|01 sanctioned|_|01 by their government|_|02 , but pakistan|_|01 shelled|_|05 across|_|01 the border|_|03 and killed|_|02 13|_|01 indian|_|01 civilians|_|01 . pakistan|_|01 is saying|_|09 india|_|01 shelled|_|05 them back|_|04 and killed|_|02 6|_|01 of theirs . they are having some sort|_|01 of dispute|_|02 over their border|_|03 and neither|_|01 side|_|10 really|_|01 wishes|_|02 to back|_|01 down . india|_|01 claims|_|04 they were destroying|_|04 a terrorist|_|01 encampment|_|01 on the pakistan|_|01 side|_|10 of the border|_|03 , and pakistan|_|01 claims|_|04 they bombed|_|02 one|_|01 of their military|_|03 bases|_|03 . the whole|_|01 thing|_|09 is a big|_|01 mess|_|05 and ca|_|01 n't help|_|01 the stability|_|02 of the region|_|01 .
did you read|_|06 this story|_|02 about the mountain|_|02 climber|_|04 who died|_|06 trying|_|01 to climb|_|05 a mountain|_|02 in vietnam|_|01 ? it was very sad|_|02 . the girlfriend|_|02 begged|_|04 him to get|_|03 help|_|02 but he refused|_|05 until it was too late|_|04 . i feel|_|04 so bad|_|01 for his|_|01 family|_|02 and girlfriend|_|02 he left|_|04 behind|_|02 . i do take|_|34 comfort|_|07 in knowing|_|01 that 's what he wanted|_|01 to do and he died|_|06 following|_|02 what he wants|_|01 .

hello|_|01 , i feel|_|01 very bad|_|01 about y 's death|_|06 , she was so young|_|01 and already|_|01 a very accomplished|_|01 person|_|01 . i do believe|_|01 she was very aware|_|01 that her flying|_|10 career|_|02 had inherent|_|01 risks|_|02 that could ultimately|_|01 cause|_|02 her death|_|06 . it angers|_|02 and saddens|_|01 me that people|_|01 would undermine|_|01 her role|_|04 a female|_|03 fighter|_|01 pilot|_|02 by making|_|08 rude|_|01 remarks|_|02 stating|_|01 there are other more accomplished|_|01 women|_|02 fliers|_|01 .
i think|_|03 in this day|_|01 and age|_|01 , there is no reason|_|02 to be poaching|_|01 tigers|_|02 , or any other rare|_|05 game|_|07 for that matter|_|05 . i 've discussed|_|02 this with my friends|_|01 before , the poachers|_|02 are generally|_|02 low|_|01 status|_|01 people|_|01 , trying|_|01 to feed|_|03 themselves , and they 're selling|_|03 to the highest|_|01 bidder|_|02 they can find|_|02 . even|_|03 if you jail|_|01 the poachers|_|02 , more will pop|_|02 up out of desperation|_|01 . one|_|05 day|_|01 , we 'll look|_|02 back|_|02 and see|_|02 all of the greed|_|01 killing|_|01 rare|_|05 animals|_|01 purposefully|_|01 , rather|_|01 than the crappy|_|01 way|_|06 we move|_|01 them out of their territories|_|03 naturally|_|04 as humans|_|02 .

i just read|_|03 that poaching|_|01 of rhinos|_|01 for ivory|_|01 has gotten|_|02 so bad|_|01 in south|_|05 africa|_|01 that they 've begun|_|10 expanding|_|01 and now have anti|_|01 - poacher|_|02 armies|_|01 . i say|_|01 good|_|13 for them . the animals|_|01 ca|_|01 n't fight|_|02 back|_|06 , but hopefully|_|01 the army|_|01 can deter|_|01 poachers|_|02 . i know|_|11 the poachers|_|02 do it because they can make|_|08 a lot|_|02 of money|_|03 , but i just do n't understand|_|01 it . big|_|11 game|_|10 hunters|_|01 / trophy|_|02 hunters|_|01 and poachers|_|02 are one|_|06 in the same to me . i think|_|03 they are both ridiculous|_|02 reasons|_|03 to harm|_|01 or kill|_|07 any animal|_|01 . the anti|_|01 - poaching|_|01 armies|_|01 have a scary|_|01 , but , i think|_|03 , extremely|_|01 necessary|_|02 job|_|01 .
france|_|02 dismantles|_|02 ' the jungle|_|01 ' in calais|_|01 — a small|_|08 camp|_|03 in calais|_|01 , france|_|02 , housing|_|01 nearly|_|07 8,000 migrants|_|01 hoping|_|05 to cross|_|01 into england|_|01 , is being evacuated|_|03 and torn|_|05 down in what french|_|01 authorities|_|01 are calling|_|19 a “ humanitarian|_|02 ” operation|_|04 . the migrants|_|01 , fleeing|_|01 their homes|_|01 in africa|_|01 and the middle|_|01 east|_|05 , are being relocated|_|02 from the camp|_|03 known|_|01 as “ the jungle|_|01 ” to centers|_|02 across|_|02 france|_|02 . some have decided|_|04 they do not want|_|01 to leave|_|08 , and protests|_|03 have resulted|_|07 in fires|_|04 burning|_|15 through tents|_|02 , trailers|_|04 , shacks|_|01 , and makeshift|_|01 shops|_|01 in the camp|_|03 . the dismantlement|_|01 operation|_|04 is expected|_|04 to last|_|02 for a week|_|01 .
" i read|_|03 an article|_|04 about how a man|_|08 killed|_|01 himself after killing|_|01 his|_|01 wife|_|01 . it sounded|_|02 like|_|02 the man|_|08 really|_|01 had some problems|_|01 . i font|_|01 understand|_|03 how you could kill|_|01 someone|_|01 that you say|_|11 you love|_|01 . the article|_|04 said|_|11 he " " hacked|_|02 his|_|01 wife|_|01 to death|_|08 " " . that sure|_|04 sounds|_|02 rather|_|02 violent|_|02 . the woman|_|02 was rushed|_|05 to the hospital|_|02 all bloody|_|01 and the man|_|08 was in a coma|_|03 . the hospital|_|02 confirmed|_|05 that the woman|_|02 had passed|_|01 . "
i think|_|01 they should find|_|13 out precisely|_|03 what she did to that child|_|04 for 3|_|01 years|_|03 and do the same thing|_|10 to her for 3|_|01 years|_|03 . since she is stronger|_|09 , she will survive|_|01 , then they can bring|_|01 her back|_|05 to complete|_|02 health|_|02 , then do it again for the next|_|03 3|_|01 years|_|03 , then keep|_|02 repeating|_|05 it until she dies|_|05 . i ca|_|01 n't comprehend|_|01 why people|_|01 like|_|02 this do these things|_|10 , but there is a special|_|04 place|_|03 in hell|_|06 . i do n't buy|_|05 the mental|_|05 illness|_|01 garbage|_|03 . of course|_|04 she has a mental|_|05 illness|_|01 , but that should n't automatically|_|01 imply|_|01 protection|_|02 from justice|_|02 . the very nature|_|02 of murder|_|01 , especially|_|01 of this kind|_|01 , requires|_|04 a mental|_|05 illness|_|01 to a certain|_|07 degree|_|01 , so no pleading|_|04 insanity|_|01 . torture|_|02 her as she tortured|_|02 that poor|_|01 boy|_|02 .
this is really|_|01 scary|_|01 . i do n't think|_|02 i would want|_|01 to have my life|_|08 in the hands|_|06 of someone|_|01 else|_|03 like|_|02 on this whaling|_|04 boat|_|01 . someone|_|01 's stupid|_|01 mistakes|_|02 can really|_|01 be bad|_|01 news|_|04 for everyone trusting|_|01 that person|_|01 . i 'm not sure|_|04 if i 'd be interested|_|01 in going|_|01 out on a boat|_|01 , whaling|_|01 , or even|_|03 a cruise|_|01 ship|_|01 after reading|_|05 this article|_|02 . just one|_|05 wrong|_|05 move|_|06 from another|_|01 person|_|01 can seal|_|01 your fate|_|04 . it must|_|01 have been so terrifying|_|01 for these people|_|01 . i definitely|_|01 believe|_|01 all the trauma|_|02 they say|_|01 they have endured|_|01 and i would definitely|_|01 rule|_|07 for them in the suits|_|06 they brought|_|11 against the plaintiff|_|01 .
i had no idea|_|01 that the great|_|01 lakes|_|03 area|_|01 had problems|_|01 with earthquakes|_|02 . i 'm glad|_|03 that it was n't a bigger|_|01 on but it is still|_|04 had how much|_|01 damage|_|02 was done . i feel|_|05 better|_|07 for those families|_|06 that lost|_|01 loved|_|01 ones|_|02 . you would think|_|06 in this modern|_|03 age|_|01 we would be able|_|02 to detect|_|01 earthquakes|_|02 sooner|_|01 and have enough|_|02 time|_|03 to evacuate|_|01 an area|_|01 .
of course|_|04 they do n't see|_|01 well|_|03 as they age|_|01 ! they 're so much|_|01 like|_|02 us|_|01 , even|_|02 in the small|_|03 details|_|03 of how they stretch|_|02 their arms|_|02 to be able|_|04 to perform|_|03 their work|_|01 . just like|_|02 my dad|_|01 when he ca|_|01 n't find|_|05 his|_|01 glasses|_|01 and tries|_|01 to read|_|06 his|_|01 magazine|_|03 . i ca|_|01 n't even|_|02 comprehend|_|01 why some people|_|01 wo n't see|_|01 how similar|_|01 animals|_|01 are to humans|_|02 - how actually|_|04 humans|_|02 are animals|_|01 . it blows|_|06 my mind|_|07 every|_|02 day|_|10 .
cohen moved|_|02 to new|_|01 york|_|01 in 1966 at age|_|01 31|_|01 to break|_|02 into the music|_|03 business|_|01 . before long|_|02 , critics|_|03 were comparing|_|04 him with bob|_|02 dylan|_|02 for the lyrical|_|01 force|_|01 of his|_|01 songwriting . although he influenced|_|01 many|_|01 musicians|_|02 and won|_|01 many|_|01 honors|_|02 , including|_|01 induction|_|01 into the rock|_|02 & roll|_|02 hall|_|07 of fame|_|01 and the order|_|13 of canada|_|01 , cohen rarely|_|01 made|_|01 the pop|_|01 music|_|03 charts|_|01 with his|_|01 sometimes|_|01 moody|_|06 folk|_|01 - rock|_|02 . his|_|01 most ardent|_|01 admirers|_|03 compared|_|04 his|_|01 works|_|05 to spiritual|_|01 prophecy|_|02 . he sang|_|05 about religion|_|02 , with references|_|01 to jesus|_|01 christ|_|01 and jewish|_|01 traditions|_|02 , as well|_|07 as love|_|02 and sex|_|01 , political|_|01 upheaval|_|03 , regret|_|02 and what he once called|_|24 the search|_|04 for “ a kind|_|01 of balance|_|01 in the chaos|_|04 of existence|_|01 .
she lost|_|11 my sympathy|_|03 really|_|01 quick|_|01 . seems|_|02 like|_|02 she likes|_|02 attention|_|03 . this does make|_|43 me look|_|02 at paris|_|04 differently|_|01 . these all seem|_|02 like|_|02 inside|_|01 jobs|_|02 . i would be safe|_|02 there . but , i still|_|04 do n't plan|_|03 on visiting|_|07 . not a fan|_|01 of people|_|01 endorsing|_|01 candidates|_|02 in countries|_|04 that they can not vote|_|05 . seems|_|02 like|_|02 an ego|_|01 thing|_|09 .
the thought|_|01 of such conditions|_|01 in the slaughtering|_|01 of chickens|_|02 is very disturbing|_|01 . i am by no means|_|03 a vegetarian|_|01 , and enjoy|_|02 eating|_|06 chicken|_|01 a great|_|03 deal|_|02 . however|_|04 , the thought|_|01 of torturing|_|02 a chicken|_|02 for slaughter|_|01 turns|_|13 my stomach|_|04 . there needs|_|01 to be an ethical|_|03 solution|_|05 to the slaughtering|_|01 of all animals|_|01 , not just chicken|_|01 . and i believe|_|01 a universal|_|03 approach|_|01 that is easily|_|03 controlled|_|03 and monitored|_|02 would be ideal|_|02 , but most likely|_|01 not cost|_|02 efficient|_|01 .
i am a firm|_|01 believer|_|01 of innocent|_|01 till|_|01 proven|_|01 guilty|_|02 . but come|_|01 on . there are multiple|_|01 accounts|_|02 with several|_|03 different|_|01 woe|_|02 . that are coming|_|01 forward|_|02 towards this guy|_|03 . this man|_|08 needs|_|03 taking|_|01 off of the streets|_|01 and put|_|07 in jail|_|01 . the things|_|11 he did to multiple|_|01 women|_|02 is disgusting|_|02 . i feel|_|05 bad|_|01 for these women|_|02 who did not come|_|01 forward|_|02 in the beginning|_|01 . whether they were scared|_|01 for their lives|_|01 or just ashamed|_|01 . it seems|_|02 like|_|02 lace|_|02 could get|_|01 a girl|_|02 but just took|_|01 things|_|11 to far|_|05 and to the next|_|03 level|_|07 . it shame|_|03 that a successful|_|01 young|_|01 man|_|08 does something like|_|02 this and ruins|_|01 his|_|01 entire|_|02 life|_|01 . over sex|_|03 .
i am upset|_|04 and disturbed|_|11 about the result|_|02 of the investigation|_|01 on the article|_|04 . it also|_|02 saddens|_|02 me to know|_|01 that the families|_|08 involved|_|05 in the missing|_|03 of those students|_|01 are still|_|04 hoping|_|06 to see|_|02 their family|_|08 member|_|01 even|_|03 after years|_|06 of waiting|_|02 . this article|_|04 reminds|_|01 me that no matter|_|02 how long|_|01 the case|_|06 , the family|_|08 will always|_|01 wait|_|02 for them to hug|_|02 those missing|_|01 students|_|01 .
some scum|_|02 bag|_|02 is at it again stealing|_|01 naked|_|05 pictures|_|04 of people|_|03 simply|_|04 because they are celebrities|_|01 and he can make|_|35 money|_|03 from doing it . it blows|_|09 my mind|_|01 the level|_|07 of shit|_|04 people|_|03 will do in order|_|01 to make|_|35 a buck|_|02 . it seems|_|02 like|_|02 people|_|03 treat|_|07 celebrities|_|01 as if they are not people|_|03 at all . people|_|03 that leave|_|04 negative|_|08 comments|_|02 on celebrity|_|01 pages|_|06 are taking|_|01 it to a new|_|05 level|_|07 . people|_|03 say|_|01 the shittiest things|_|09 to each other when they 're hiding|_|05 behind|_|02 their computer|_|01 screen|_|01 . this particular|_|02 guy|_|03 took|_|01 it to the extreme|_|01 by stealing|_|01 their private|_|02 photos|_|01 .

" i just ca|_|01 n't imagine|_|02 that this poor|_|06 4|_|01 year|_|03 old|_|07 was blinded|_|03 the way|_|11 she was . but then i wonder|_|03 if it is truly|_|01 an act|_|05 of justice|_|02 to carry|_|20 out the same punishment|_|01 on the perpetrator|_|01 . it seems|_|04 so human|_|03 to want|_|01 revenge|_|01 , but it also|_|02 feel|_|07 so useless|_|01 . in a way|_|11 it seems|_|04 to make|_|48 " " us|_|01 " " as " " bad|_|01 " " as him . it just makes|_|48 me sad|_|02 . "
i agree|_|07 that this election|_|04 is stressful|_|01 . there seems|_|02 to be a lot|_|05 of tension|_|02 between parties|_|04 . people|_|03 are worried|_|02 about what could happen|_|01 if trump|_|02 wins|_|01 . i think|_|01 all of the racists|_|01 will come|_|20 out of the woodwork|_|01 . people|_|03 wo n’t be comfortable|_|02 . as a minority|_|01 , i think|_|01 things|_|11 will feel|_|05 different|_|01 . people|_|03 earn’t scared|_|01 to post|_|01 when behind|_|01 a wall|_|07 on social|_|04 media|_|02 .
it always|_|04 upsets|_|06 me when i read|_|06 articles|_|04 about land|_|02 conflicts|_|06 involving|_|01 native|_|01 american|_|02 tribes|_|02 , especially|_|01 when it involves|_|01 oil|_|01 pipelines|_|02 . i fully|_|01 support|_|01 expanding|_|03 domestic|_|05 oil|_|01 operations|_|07 so as to better|_|13 establish|_|02 energy|_|04 independence|_|02 , but care|_|06 should be taken|_|06 to respect|_|02 the needs|_|02 of others when developing|_|01 pipelines|_|02 . it may|_|01 be expensive|_|01 to ensure|_|10 environmental|_|02 care|_|06 is taken|_|06 and , when necessary|_|01 , to reroute the pipelines|_|02 to avoid|_|01 encroaching|_|01 on sacred|_|02 lands|_|02 , but that does n't mean|_|04 it 's not worth|_|02 the expense|_|01 .
i just read|_|09 this article|_|01 indirectly|_|01 about climate|_|02 change|_|01 that i know|_|01 you 'll find|_|02 interesting|_|01 . it talks|_|02 about the extinction|_|02 of three|_|02 different|_|01 species|_|01 . it 's a sad|_|01 situation|_|02 , but if you read|_|09 it , it was almost|_|07 entirely|_|01 the fault|_|01 of man|_|10 , and climate|_|02 change|_|01 only played|_|18 a small|_|04 part|_|01 . the worst|_|01 part|_|01 is that it could have been prevented|_|02 if somebody|_|01 had sounded|_|06 the alarm|_|01 in time|_|01 .
my heart|_|10 hurts|_|05 for those affected|_|02 . i will be praying|_|01 for the soldiers|_|02 attacked|_|01 and their families|_|06 . as we approach|_|01 memorial|_|03 day|_|01 , we need|_|02 to reflect|_|03 on what we have learned|_|01 in past|_|01 wars|_|01 and one|_|01 thing|_|05 is clear|_|09 , mustard|_|03 gas|_|01 is not a weapon|_|01 that should be used|_|06 , i understand|_|02 that many|_|01 of the attacks|_|01 going|_|01 on right|_|08 now include|_|01 guerrilla|_|01 warfare|_|01 but we can not fight|_|06 back|_|05 in the same ways|_|11 .
i am writing|_|05 to you in response|_|01 to an article|_|04 i just read|_|09 about nevada|_|01 and the water|_|02 supply|_|01 . it is of a truth|_|03 , as the article|_|04 points|_|01 out that the news|_|01 media|_|08 primarily|_|02 only follows|_|01 what happens|_|01 in california|_|01 , and not nevada|_|01 . which is the driest|_|16 state|_|04 , and in need|_|02 of attention|_|01 and assistance|_|02 . i 'm impressed|_|01 with verna brady|_|02 , 86|_|01 - year|_|02 - old|_|01 resident|_|01 there . who cites|_|01 she would rather|_|01 move|_|01 forward|_|03 , than behind|_|02 , that she , although an elder|_|01 with many|_|01 childhood|_|02 memories|_|01 , would rather|_|01 adapt|_|03 to what 's required|_|02 for today|_|02 , than harbor|_|01 on what use|_|01 to be . that 's a large|_|01 statement|_|01 , because when it comes|_|04 to tribes|_|03 in america|_|01 , a lot|_|07 do not to be displaced|_|02 , or relocation|_|01 , creating|_|03 emotional|_|01 and psychological|_|01 problems|_|01 are the results|_|01 . however|_|01 the present|_|01 state|_|04 is also|_|02 causing|_|01 more abuse|_|03 factors|_|01 in the family|_|01 .
its crazy|_|01 that really|_|01 intense|_|03 and sad|_|02 situations|_|03 are happening|_|04 around|_|01 the world|_|08 but here in usa|_|01 were worried|_|06 more about who made|_|07 it passed|_|01 the first|_|06 round|_|11 of the voice|_|02 or what s the latest|_|05 viral|_|01 videos|_|01 . the fact|_|03 the extremists|_|01 are using|_|01 innocent|_|07 civilians|_|01 as human|_|03 shields|_|02 is so cowardly|_|01 and shows|_|08 they have no honor|_|04 what so ever|_|03 .
i was reading|_|03 about this article|_|04 and got|_|03 caught|_|07 up in it because of the main|_|03 topic|_|02 when it had started|_|08 , it began|_|07 talking|_|02 about all of these massive|_|04 shootings|_|02 that have been going|_|16 on around|_|04 the country|_|04 . i felt|_|01 like|_|04 that was the main|_|03 idea|_|01 and discussing|_|02 the murders|_|01 in the united|_|01 states|_|02 i feel|_|05 like|_|04 they could have posted|_|01 the differences|_|04 between the states|_|02 and other countries|_|04 around|_|04 the world|_|01 as well|_|07 . its free|_|01 writing|_|02 but i think|_|03 it makes|_|35 americans|_|01 look|_|02 bad|_|01 .
while i think|_|03 many|_|01 of us|_|01 are troubled|_|01 with the recent|_|01 relations|_|01 with russia|_|01 and suspicion|_|02 of rigging|_|01 our us|_|01 election|_|03 , in cahoots|_|01 with pouts|_|01 trump|_|01 and hacking|_|08 , we need|_|02 to sort|_|03 through the details|_|01 and make|_|35 sure|_|08 we are using|_|01 facts|_|01 when they are available|_|01 . suspicions|_|02 are sometimes|_|01 unfounded|_|01 , my heart|_|01 goes|_|02 out to the agent|_|01 's family|_|01 .
gosh , who would do something as horrible|_|03 as kill|_|02 an innocent|_|05 animal|_|01 ( and a baby|_|02 at that ) ? however|_|04 , i am glad|_|03 that the salt|_|01 river|_|01 wild|_|03 horse|_|02 management|_|01 group|_|03 and the american|_|01 wild|_|03 horse|_|02 preservation|_|01 campaign|_|01 set|_|01 up a reward|_|01 to catch|_|18 whoever did that . i was also|_|02 happy|_|02 to see|_|01 that it was an immediate|_|05 response|_|01 , not a delayed|_|01 one|_|02 . it 's sad|_|02 that people|_|01 wo n't come|_|02 forward|_|02 on their own to bring|_|02 justice|_|02 and that there has to be a monetary|_|01 incentive|_|01 .
the problem|_|01 of poaching|_|02 has become|_|04 such an epidemic|_|01 guides|_|03 in south|_|05 africa|_|01 who use|_|01 to take|_|09 hunters|_|01 on big|_|01 game|_|07 safari|_|04 's are now becoming|_|04 a different|_|03 kind|_|01 of hunter|_|01 themselves . they 've taken|_|09 up arms|_|01 in the war|_|01 on poaching|_|02 due|_|03 to the fact|_|01 it is an outrageous|_|01 epidemic|_|01 at this point|_|20 . animals|_|01 like|_|02 the rhino|_|01 are on the brink|_|02 of extinction|_|06 and poachers|_|02 do n't care|_|02 .
i guess|_|02 the indigenous|_|01 people|_|03 get|_|21 screwed|_|01 again . technology|_|02 and progress|_|03 is always|_|04 messing|_|01 with them . i 'm kinda|_|02 worried|_|03 about the fishing|_|02 i do . i fish|_|02 a good|_|18 bit|_|05 and eat|_|02 what i catch|_|21 . i hope|_|03 there is n't any methyl|_|01 mercury|_|04 in the fish|_|02 i eat|_|02 . if there is , i wonder|_|03 if it has messed|_|01 me up some . that could be where some of my health|_|02 problems|_|01 come|_|01 from . maybe|_|01 it 's time|_|06 to stop|_|01 eating|_|02 the fish|_|02 i catch|_|21 .
just read|_|03 an article|_|04 about the situation|_|01 in haiti|_|01 a month|_|02 after the hurricane|_|01 . relief|_|02 is being distributed|_|04 better|_|09 than after the last|_|02 hurricane|_|01 since the capital|_|04 city|_|03 was less|_|01 affected|_|02 and learning|_|02 from the previous|_|03 situation|_|01 were used|_|01 to make|_|03 some improvements|_|03 . but getting|_|02 food|_|01 and water|_|02 purification|_|01 tablets|_|03 distributed|_|04 , and fairly|_|01 , is a big|_|01 problem|_|01 . people|_|03 are crazed|_|01 with hunger|_|02 and become|_|03 violent|_|02 , or give|_|27 in to despair|_|01 . cholera|_|01 is revving|_|02 up . these are the immediate|_|05 problems|_|01 , but shelter|_|01 , long|_|01 - term|_|01 rebuilding|_|01 , voting|_|05 in the upcoming|_|01 election|_|01 , and other issues|_|04 lurk|_|01 too . somehow|_|02 we have to figure|_|02 out better|_|09 relief|_|02 efforts|_|01 for natural|_|07 disasters|_|01 .
aw , look|_|03 , i did n't know|_|01 pete burns|_|01 died|_|01 . i 'm glad|_|03 he was happy|_|01 with all his|_|01 surgeries|_|06 and his|_|01 life|_|05 , even|_|01 if i was n't . he was so hot|_|15 before he did all that , man|_|09 . gorgeous|_|01 voice|_|10 . why are all the pretty|_|01 ones|_|01 so often|_|05 the wrong|_|01 kind|_|01 of crazy|_|01 ? now i have to go|_|03 listen|_|02 to that song|_|01 , or it 's going|_|03 to be stuck|_|01 in my head|_|01 all day|_|01 .
hey i just wanted|_|01 to let|_|02 you know|_|01 that this is a rough|_|01 article|_|04 . the guy|_|03 took|_|06 him out and then took|_|06 his|_|01 own life|_|06 . its pretty|_|02 sad|_|02 . the guy|_|03 knew|_|01 the employees|_|01 schedule|_|02 too so he just could have done it whenever . why would he do it and take|_|06 his|_|01 own life|_|06 though|_|01 i font|_|01 understand|_|01 . anyways|_|01 wanted|_|01 to let|_|02 you know|_|01 i did read|_|06 it and its tragic|_|01 . i feel|_|05 bad|_|01 for the family|_|08 that it happened|_|01 to them . hopefully|_|02 this does n't happen|_|01 much|_|01 more
well|_|07 that sucks|_|01 for this people|_|01 in the south|_|05 . it seems|_|02 like|_|02 there 's always|_|04 something that 's messing|_|02 with the gas|_|01 prices|_|02 . hopefully|_|01 they 'll get|_|02 it repaired|_|02 soon|_|01 though|_|01 and things|_|01 will go|_|01 back|_|03 to normal|_|04 . at least|_|01 there was n't severe|_|06 environmental|_|02 damage|_|02 , that 's a good|_|13 thing|_|01 . if i were down there , i would probably|_|01 just ride|_|01 a bike|_|01 for a few weeks|_|01 .
i am shocked|_|01 and saddened|_|02 by this . what a sad|_|02 and terrible|_|02 tragedy|_|01 . i feel|_|04 so sorry|_|01 for all the victims|_|02 and those affected|_|05 by this event|_|03 . i ca|_|01 n't even|_|03 imagine|_|02 how devastating|_|01 this must|_|01 be for them . what an incredible|_|01 catastrophe|_|01 . my thoughts|_|01 and prayers|_|05 and best|_|03 wishes|_|04 go|_|01 out for all the many|_|01 people|_|03 affected|_|05 by this tragic|_|01 catastrophe|_|01 . i hope|_|03 that everyone stays|_|01 safe|_|02 for the foreseeable|_|01 future|_|03 . i am still|_|03 in shock|_|01 .
hats|_|02 really|_|01 heartbreaking|_|02 to read|_|03 the story|_|01 about the man|_|08 who lost|_|11 his|_|01 family|_|04 in a car|_|01 crash|_|05 . i think|_|09 people|_|01 who street|_|01 race|_|01 are acting|_|02 very dangerously|_|01 for now reason|_|03 and it is usually|_|01 very stupid|_|01 young|_|01 males|_|02 who do this . i font|_|01 know|_|01 what sense|_|02 to make|_|42 out of this since the woman|_|02 and her children|_|02 did not seem|_|02 to do anything to deserve|_|01 this . maybe|_|01 it takes|_|35 stories|_|01 like|_|02 this to make|_|42 us|_|01 realize|_|03 how p[precious life|_|01 is and how careful|_|01 we must|_|01 be
did you hear|_|02 about this shooting|_|02 ? it appears|_|02 to be random|_|01 and utterly|_|01 senseless|_|01 . an elderly|_|01 man|_|08 was killed|_|01 and the suspect|_|01 is now barricaded|_|03 in his|_|01 house|_|06 . there was a lot|_|07 of misinformation|_|01 early|_|02 on about it being related|_|02 to the election|_|04 and that the suspect|_|01 was a woman|_|01 . it 's being reported|_|06 now that both those claims|_|07 are false|_|10 . i really|_|01 feel|_|12 for that man|_|08 and his|_|01 family|_|04 .
did you see|_|01 this sad|_|02 story|_|02 ? this holocaust|_|02 survivor|_|02 has died|_|04 . she lived|_|05 a fruitful|_|01 life|_|05 recreating|_|04 a town|_|01 and now she is dead|_|17 . do you ever|_|03 think|_|10 of how sad|_|02 life|_|05 can be . this person|_|01 survived|_|01 the awful|_|01 genocidal regime|_|01 of hitler|_|01 . why do human|_|03 beings seek|_|01 to contribute|_|08 so much|_|01 pain|_|04 to one|_|05 another|_|01 . it is a sad|_|02 and horrible|_|03 way|_|06 of being .
i do n't know|_|05 if you 've seen|_|01 this article|_|01 about the war|_|01 on cops|_|05 , but i found|_|05 it pretty|_|01 unconvincing|_|01 . it actually|_|02 made|_|43 me a bit|_|10 angry|_|01 , because it focuses|_|05 on police|_|01 deaths|_|08 form|_|02 two|_|01 years|_|03 ago|_|01 and does n't take|_|06 into account|_|05 current|_|01 figures|_|04 . also|_|02 , by focusing|_|05 on deaths|_|08 alone|_|02 , it completely|_|01 glosses|_|03 over injuries|_|02 to paint|_|03 a picture|_|01 that policing|_|01 is safe|_|02 in the current|_|01 climate|_|02 . it feels|_|05 a lot|_|02 like|_|02 fake|_|02 news|_|01 to me . all you have to do is pick|_|05 up the paper|_|01 to see|_|01 how often|_|05 cops|_|01 are involved|_|01 in fights|_|01 with criminals|_|01 and crazy|_|05 people|_|03 .
it aggravates|_|02 me that in our modern|_|05 society|_|01 leaders|_|01 are condemned|_|06 before they even|_|01 have an opportunity|_|01 to lead|_|23 . it will happen|_|03 forevermore|_|01 into the future|_|03 no matter|_|02 who wins|_|05 elections|_|02 from here on out . the issue|_|02 is not opposition|_|05 so much|_|04 as it is the ability|_|02 to organize|_|01 against someone|_|01 anymore|_|01 . using|_|01 the internet|_|01 , it is quite|_|03 easy|_|03 to gather|_|07 a group|_|01 of thousands|_|01 and perhaps|_|01 even|_|01 hundreds|_|01 of thousands|_|01 to combat|_|01 against something vile|_|01 or unwarranted|_|03 . the problem|_|01 is trump|_|02 was n't even|_|01 given|_|01 a chance|_|01 . now that things|_|12 have played|_|02 out , perhaps|_|01 some of those people|_|01 were right|_|08 about their hatred|_|01 or grievances|_|02 but its entirely|_|01 unfair|_|01 to subject|_|01 any president|_|02 of our country|_|04 to this before they have even|_|01 been given|_|01 the chance|_|01 to lead|_|23 .
i really|_|01 think|_|09 racism|_|02 is getting|_|01 out of hand|_|06 lately|_|01 . i do n't understand|_|02 why people|_|03 have to commit|_|01 hate|_|01 crimes|_|02 against people|_|03 that they are n't similar|_|03 to . everyone deserves|_|01 to live|_|01 a happy|_|01 life|_|05 without being assaulted|_|01 or worried|_|06 that they 'll be assaulted|_|01 . and chalking|_|01 it up to religion|_|02 is even|_|03 worse|_|01 . people|_|03 do n't have to be so easily|_|02 offended|_|05 these days|_|04 , but they are , and they 're hate|_|01 filled|_|01 while they 're offended|_|05 too .
i agree|_|07 with this article|_|01 completely|_|01 . i used|_|01 to take|_|35 the pill|_|05 for awhile|_|01 and it did change|_|01 my moods|_|02 and make|_|18 me feel|_|06 weird|_|02 and just off . so i switched|_|04 to the dope|_|09 shot|_|09 and same thing|_|11 . it made|_|18 me feel|_|06 super|_|01 depressed|_|01 and also|_|02 made|_|18 me gain|_|08 a lot|_|04 of weight|_|02 . i have had some kind|_|01 of bad|_|01 side|_|10 effect|_|01 with every|_|01 birth|_|05 control|_|02 i 've ever|_|01 tried|_|01 . i refuse|_|04 to take|_|35 any form|_|01 of birth|_|05 control|_|02 now except|_|01 for condoms|_|01 and i track|_|01 my cycle|_|01 so i know|_|05 when i 'm fertile|_|02 .
" i do n't know|_|01 who this celebrity|_|01 is , but is n't this crazy|_|01 ? of course|_|07 it 'd happen|_|02 in florida|_|01 ! we always|_|02 hear|_|02 these " " florida|_|01 man|_|08 " " stories|_|01 , and here 's another|_|01 one|_|01 . what are people|_|01 thinking|_|01 , anyway|_|01 ? what was this guy|_|01 hoping|_|02 to do ? pretty|_|01 weird|_|01 world|_|08 we live|_|02 in nowadays|_|01 . i 'd never|_|02 want|_|05 to live|_|02 down there with all the crazy|_|01 stuff|_|05 that goes|_|04 on ! "
according|_|01 to a new|_|01 study|_|02 , the polar|_|04 regions|_|03 are continuing|_|04 to melt|_|01 . in a decade|_|01 , a lot|_|05 of the ice|_|02 melted|_|01 . this situation|_|01 is really|_|01 affecting|_|01 polar|_|04 bears|_|02 because they live|_|01 in that environment|_|01 . i found|_|02 out that they ambush|_|01 seals|_|09 as they come|_|04 up out of the water|_|01 . whether we can change|_|02 this trend|_|05 or not , i am not sure|_|08 about but we should try|_|01 .
trump|_|02 is a fool|_|01 . climate|_|02 change|_|03 is real|_|03 and it 's starting|_|07 to effect|_|01 us|_|01 directly|_|04 . i wonder|_|01 when he 'll realize|_|03 we have to do something . how much|_|01 does it take|_|05 ? maybe|_|01 his|_|01 golf|_|01 curse|_|01 has to catch|_|20 fire|_|09 just like|_|02 the forests|_|02 . this does n't only effect|_|01 us|_|01 but the whole|_|02 world|_|01 and the life|_|01 on it . united|_|05 states|_|02 needs|_|01 to take|_|05 action|_|01 before it 's too late|_|01 .
i have think|_|03 is very good|_|09 article|_|04 and nice.he has promised|_|04 the to be the most vigilant|_|02 interrogator|_|01 of the obama administration|_|02 from his|_|01 perch|_|07 on an oversight|_|01 committee|_|02 , which republican|_|02 cheered|_|03 . this sentence|_|01 i am very like|_|02 . numerous|_|01 ballot|_|01 initiatives|_|01 focused|_|02 on progressive|_|01 caused|_|01 could also|_|02 give|_|18 republican|_|02 few reasons|_|02 to turn|_|01 out . the reason|_|02 must|_|01 important|_|01 for the areas|_|03 .
i just read|_|06 an article|_|04 about some chowder|_|01 - head|_|01 who used|_|01 a hammer|_|02 and a pick|_|07 ax|_|01 to destroy|_|04 donald trump|_|01 's star|_|05 on the hollywood|_|02 walk|_|01 of fame|_|02 . wow|_|02 , what a great|_|01 protest|_|03 . you sure|_|01 showed|_|10 him . good|_|12 job|_|01 . lola , can you believe|_|01 this garbage|_|03 ? who has such a hollow|_|02 and pathetic|_|01 life|_|01 that they do n't have anything better|_|12 to do with their time|_|06 than commit|_|18 petty|_|03 vandalism|_|01 because they dislike|_|01 some politician|_|03 ? what a dingus .
how can people|_|01 take|_|02 something like|_|02 relationships|_|02 for granted|_|05 ? it 's infuriating|_|01 that in a world|_|08 where i have to fight|_|01 for the right|_|01 to marry|_|02 the person|_|01 i love|_|01 and adore|_|01 and want|_|01 to pamper|_|01 and cherish|_|02 and share|_|01 a life|_|01 with that there are assholes|_|01 out there like|_|02 this with anger|_|01 issues|_|06 who will get|_|01 in their alleged|_|01 partner|_|01 's face|_|05 and shout|_|01 . the hate|_|01 is just mind|_|02 blowing|_|01 .
these numbers|_|02 leave|_|08 little|_|01 room|_|04 to think|_|01 that climate|_|02 change|_|01 is not happening|_|04 . as you know|_|11 , i firmly|_|01 believe|_|01 in the importance|_|02 of environmental|_|02 protections|_|02 and think|_|01 climate|_|02 change|_|01 is a problem|_|01 . however|_|01 , articles|_|04 like|_|02 this only add|_|01 to the problem|_|01 . these numbers|_|02 are shocking|_|01 on the surface|_|04 but could easily|_|03 be explained|_|02 by natural|_|04 fluctuations|_|01 year|_|03 to year|_|03 . i wish|_|02 they would focus|_|02 on balanced|_|01 science|_|02 instead|_|01 .
i saw|_|01 a story|_|03 about yemen|_|01 today|_|01 . have you read|_|06 about it . it looks|_|02 like|_|02 ethnic|_|02 cleansing|_|01 over there . it is so awful|_|02 hearing|_|02 about innocent|_|04 people|_|01 being killed|_|07 just because of where they are from . it 's like|_|02 nazi|_|02 germany|_|01 in some parts|_|01 of the world|_|08 . it is very scary|_|01 to me . nobody|_|04 is really|_|01 doing anything but making|_|43 proclamations|_|01 . rights|_|01 groups|_|01 ca|_|01 n't seem|_|02 to do anything either|_|01 . i wish|_|02 these evil|_|01 people|_|01 would stop|_|01 doing this .
water|_|06 parks|_|02 and amusement|_|01 parks|_|02 in general|_|02 are just disasters|_|01 waiting|_|01 to happen|_|01 . we truly|_|01 do n't know|_|10 how dangerous|_|02 some of these things|_|12 are until something goes|_|03 wrong|_|01 . then we all see|_|01 what was so obvious|_|01 yet|_|01 impossible|_|03 to see|_|01 until pointed|_|01 out . i am going|_|03 to avoid|_|02 these places|_|01 like|_|02 the plague|_|04 . plus|_|04 life|_|05 is too short|_|01 to wait|_|01 in lines|_|01 .
so i feel|_|05 birth|_|01 is birth|_|01 . what difference|_|03 does it make|_|03 it you gave|_|04 it vaginal|_|01 or c|_|01 - section|_|03 . so people|_|03 can be so evil|_|01 in this world|_|01 . you were pregnant|_|01 and carried|_|01 that baby|_|04 in your belly|_|05 for 8|_|01 to 9|_|01 months|_|02 . some ladies|_|03 are faced|_|01 with a life|_|05 or death|_|05 even|_|04 choice|_|02 . we have to do what is right|_|12 for our babies|_|04 but mostly|_|01 for ourselves . i know|_|11 you think|_|03 wow|_|01 selfish|_|01 much|_|01 , no this i why . if you are not here you can not raise|_|02 and happy|_|02 healthy|_|01 family|_|01 . next|_|03 if you are not your best|_|03 or at 100|_|01 % you really|_|01 can not give|_|04 your all .
there has been talks|_|03 on how this is an agenda|_|02 that is being pushed|_|01 right|_|07 now , just like|_|02 the massive|_|04 shootings|_|02 right|_|07 now . people|_|01 are just killing|_|07 innocent|_|05 people|_|01 no matter|_|06 what the color|_|08 of there skin|_|06 is although people|_|01 are always|_|04 going|_|04 to find|_|01 a way|_|10 to make|_|08 it a racial|_|02 matter|_|06 or discuss|_|02 how its biased|_|01 or how the person|_|01 was a racist|_|01 but the only one|_|02 who knows|_|10 that is the person|_|01 who commuted|_|04 the act|_|02 .
hey , i know|_|05 you asked|_|01 me about what happened|_|02 to that mother|_|05 and her baby|_|03 in new|_|06 york|_|01 and here 's the full|_|01 article|_|04 . it 's so sad|_|02 ... that baby|_|03 could have lived|_|02 their life|_|05 to the fullest|_|01 and now it 's cut|_|02 short|_|01 . the mother|_|05 will have to grieve|_|02 over what happened|_|02 to ... it 's so sad|_|02 that things|_|09 like|_|02 this happen|_|02 .
reading|_|03 this article|_|04 makes|_|01 me feel|_|05 sad|_|02 for many|_|01 reason|_|01 . i myself have no idea|_|01 why those countries|_|04 are always|_|02 at war|_|01 and why so many|_|01 people|_|01 are loosing|_|01 their lives|_|10 . it also|_|02 makes|_|01 me sad|_|02 to imagine|_|02 myself in a situation|_|01 where i am constantly|_|02 in fear|_|03 of my life|_|10 . with so many|_|01 being lost|_|07 already|_|01 it makes|_|01 me sad|_|02 to think|_|09 about these things|_|11 continually|_|01 happening|_|02 .
hello|_|01 , i will tell|_|01 you something , an article|_|04 i read|_|03 recently|_|01 , said|_|01 that millions|_|02 of nigerians|_|01 survived|_|02 biko hiram , but now a humanitarian|_|02 catastrophe|_|03 is putting|_|07 their lives|_|05 at risk|_|02 again , wise|_|01 about this information|_|01 i think|_|10 it is more important|_|01 information|_|01 than it seems|_|04 be , i would consider|_|01 that it is a news|_|01 that should happen|_|01 even|_|01 by television|_|01
" trump|_|02 and putin|_|01 talk|_|05 about syria|_|01 in pacific|_|01 terms|_|03 but then russian|_|01 warships|_|01 bomb|_|05 aleppo|_|01 , the bombing|_|02 said|_|11 to be for " " show|_|01 . " " a show|_|01 that is destroying|_|02 the city|_|03 and its people|_|01 . this is really|_|01 outrageous|_|01 . at least|_|01 we are getting|_|01 some reporting|_|03 about it , even|_|03 though|_|01 it 's just frustrating|_|02 since we ca|_|01 n't really|_|01 do anything , and trump|_|02 is looking|_|02 the other way|_|06 . the syrian|_|01 problems|_|01 seem|_|02 likely|_|01 to drag|_|01 down the world|_|08 for years|_|03 to come|_|04 .

the general|_|02 rule|_|09 of thumb|_|02 is that to be healthy|_|03 individuals|_|01 need|_|01 to get|_|01 a minimum|_|02 of eight|_|01 hours|_|02 of sleep|_|01 a night|_|06 . some people|_|01 get|_|01 more , and some people|_|01 get|_|01 along|_|03 well|_|01 with less|_|03 , but everyone needs|_|01 to get|_|01 enough|_|02 sleep|_|01 or else|_|03 they can not function|_|01 effectively|_|01 in their everyday|_|01 activities|_|01 . in their work|_|02 , your guide|_|01 to a healthy|_|03 sleep|_|01 , national|_|01 institutes|_|01 of health|_|02 pointed|_|01 out that sleep|_|01 is very important|_|01 to human|_|03 existence|_|01 , so important|_|01 that one|_|01 - third|_|01 of a person|_|01 ’s life|_|08 is spent|_|03 doing it ( 1|_|01 ) . in sleep|_|01 , sleep|_|01 disorders|_|01 , and biological|_|01 rhythms|_|01 , tamerlane|_|01 said|_|01 , “ sleep|_|01 is a required|_|01 activity|_|01 , not an option|_|02 ” ( 19|_|01 ) . during sleep|_|01 the human|_|03 body|_|01 has an opportunity|_|01 to recuperate|_|04 from the activities|_|01 of the day|_|05 . the recuperation|_|01 goes|_|03 beyond|_|01 they

if you are wearing|_|09 contacts|_|07 for your vision|_|05 to improve|_|03 then you should be sure|_|07 to take|_|29 them out when sleeping|_|02 . you can get|_|02 some bacteria|_|01 in your eye|_|05 that will accumulate|_|02 and might|_|01 cause|_|02 problems|_|01 if you do not do this . i forgot|_|03 what the thing|_|01 was called|_|03 but it might|_|01 even|_|03 cause|_|02 the contact|_|07 user|_|01 to become|_|01 blinded|_|01 .

hey , this is some sad|_|02 news|_|01 . the rhino|_|01 could n't be saved|_|08 from his|_|01 infectious|_|01 diseases|_|01 , so he had to be put|_|04 down . i feel|_|05 bad|_|01 for the animal|_|01 as he or she did n't have to live|_|05 this way|_|11 . in addition|_|04 , it was difficult|_|02 to find|_|02 treatment|_|01 for the rhino|_|01 , so i feel|_|05 bad|_|01 for the veterinarians|_|01 that had to take|_|06 care|_|02 of the rhino|_|01 .
i can not believe|_|01 this ! how can they do this to people|_|03 ? they have less|_|03 than a week|_|01 to move|_|02 out after some of them being there for over 10|_|01 years|_|06 . i am just saddened|_|01 that political|_|03 and ideological|_|02 strife|_|02 will deny|_|04 not only teacher|_|02 from working|_|21 , but for students|_|01 to be able|_|02 to have a quality|_|02 education|_|03 . what can we do to help|_|03 ? let|_|02 me know|_|01 if you know|_|01 what we can rally|_|02 against .
i 'm not sure|_|07 what the gay|_|01 community|_|01 hoped|_|03 to accomplish|_|01 by holding|_|03 a gay|_|02 pride|_|05 event|_|02 in a country|_|02 where homosexuality|_|01 is illegal|_|01 . it 's not like|_|02 people|_|01 there ignore|_|04 such a law|_|04 , since someone|_|01 was powerful|_|01 enough|_|01 to criminalize|_|01 sexual|_|02 preference|_|04 in the first|_|02 place|_|01 . i think|_|01 i would rather|_|02 stay|_|04 under the radar|_|01 until i could find|_|05 a more tolerant|_|05 place|_|01 to live|_|02 .
i always|_|04 wonder|_|02 whether to believe|_|01 articles|_|04 like|_|01 this . i have always|_|04 liked|_|04 may|_|01 weather|_|01 , and i feel|_|05 there are probably|_|01 two|_|01 sides|_|07 to this story|_|02 . besides|_|01 , the lawsuit|_|01 is filed|_|02 but there is no verdict|_|01 yet|_|01 , so may|_|01 weather|_|01 could be innocent|_|07 . anyone can file|_|02 a lawsuit|_|01 and the only proof|_|02 of who is right|_|12 is when the suit|_|06 is decided|_|04 . i will be interested|_|01 to follow|_|01 the outcome|_|01 of this one|_|01 .
hey , i was just reading|_|03 an article|_|04 about that house|_|05 fire|_|01 that happened|_|01 in wv|_|01 . can you imagine|_|02 the tragedy|_|01 ? that is such a horrible|_|03 way|_|02 to die|_|01 . and to think|_|02 that two|_|01 of the victims|_|02 were children|_|02 plus|_|04 their dog|_|01 . it makes|_|19 me ill|_|01 just thinking|_|02 about it . such a huge|_|01 loss|_|01 for that family|_|01 and the community|_|01 . i hope|_|03 officials|_|02 find|_|04 out soon|_|01 what caused|_|02 it and i pray|_|01 for the friends|_|03 and family|_|01 of those who were killed|_|01 . so sad|_|01 !
are you aware|_|01 that only certain|_|01 refuges|_|01 are helped|_|01 and accepted|_|07 ? i ca|_|01 n't imagine|_|02 the heart|_|06 break|_|02 that they endure|_|01 traveling|_|01 so far|_|03 thinking|_|02 they are safe|_|02 to be turned|_|06 around|_|04 and denied|_|02 . the whole|_|02 system|_|05 is so flawed|_|01 . there is no appropriate|_|01 help|_|02 for these people|_|03 ! they have so many|_|01 unfair|_|01 hurdles|_|01 to go|_|03 through .
here is an article|_|02 for you . it 's an old|_|01 one|_|06 , obviously|_|01 . i am so sick|_|01 of republicans|_|03 . they are a cowardly|_|01 , spineless|_|01 bunch|_|02 who fall|_|15 in line|_|27 behind|_|01 trump|_|02 every|_|01 time|_|02 . let|_|02 's hope|_|06 they get|_|01 a major|_|04 butt|_|01 whooping|_|01 in november|_|01 . but this article|_|02 demonstrates|_|01 how we ca|_|01 n't take|_|29 anything for granted|_|03 . i remember|_|01 back|_|04 then , when all the polls|_|05 showing|_|04 wins|_|01 for hillary|_|01 and the democrats|_|02 . i have n't trusted|_|06 the polls|_|05 since then , and i know|_|01 you do n't trust|_|06 them either|_|01 . and who knows|_|01 what the russians|_|02 are going|_|01 to do this time|_|02 around|_|04 ? no one|_|01 has tried|_|01 to stop|_|01 them , so why would n't they try|_|01 to interfere|_|01 in our elections|_|04 again ? we have to keep|_|02 an eye|_|05 out and do whatever|_|01 we can to make|_|02 sure|_|07 there 's no funny|_|02 business|_|01 at the polls|_|05 in november|_|01 .

this makes|_|43 me very upset|_|05 . they do n't want|_|01 to take|_|06 responsibility|_|03 , blames|_|03 it on something else|_|03 . it 's clearly|_|01 your fault|_|01 and you should feel|_|05 guilty|_|02 for killing|_|02 all these people|_|01 . they have every|_|01 right|_|01 to sue|_|01 you for your stupid|_|01 mistake|_|02 . we live|_|02 in a world|_|08 with idiots|_|01 . next|_|02 time|_|02 you take|_|06 the car|_|01 to work|_|03 , remember|_|01 that you ca|_|01 n't count|_|06 yourself to be safe|_|02 if you are careful|_|01 .
this article|_|04 about the philippines|_|01 mayor|_|01 is very alarming|_|02 . it is a shame|_|02 that so many|_|01 people|_|03 resort|_|03 to corruption|_|01 and bad|_|01 deeds|_|02 . it is also|_|02 unfortunate|_|03 that it had to end|_|01 in casualties|_|01 . people|_|03 should really|_|01 evaluate|_|02 their behavior|_|01 and how it impacts|_|01 others . i would not want|_|05 to go|_|01 traveling|_|01 there if this is how they behave|_|02 !
it 's horrifying|_|02 to see|_|01 a dog|_|01 subjected|_|01 to such a cruel|_|01 fate|_|04 . this brings|_|11 attention|_|01 to the numerous|_|01 other cases|_|06 of fatalism|_|02 that would 've been prevented|_|02 by careful|_|01 inspection|_|01 and care|_|01 for one|_|04 's pets|_|01 . dogs|_|01 deserve|_|01 better|_|17 from us|_|01 , and it 's our obligation|_|03 as human|_|03 beings to provide|_|06 care|_|01 for animals|_|01 as much|_|01 as possible|_|01 .
i just read|_|06 an article|_|04 about elephants|_|02 and how they are becoming|_|04 extinct|_|01 due|_|02 to people|_|03 being more concerned|_|01 towards their need|_|01 fr|_|01 ivory|_|01 than they are for the precious|_|02 lives|_|13 of elephants|_|02 . i do n't understand|_|01 why people|_|03 have such little|_|01 regards|_|01 for the well|_|05 being of the elephant|_|02 species|_|01 , knowing|_|01 that they are on the verge|_|04 of extinction|_|02 and it upsets|_|06 me severely|_|01 knowing|_|01 that we are taking|_|01 them for granted|_|02 .
france|_|01 has been through a lot|_|05 of crap|_|01 lately|_|01 . some terrorists|_|01 stormed|_|01 a newspaper|_|04 office|_|04 and killed|_|02 some people|_|01 ; their have been bombings|_|02 at the airports|_|01 and train|_|04 stations|_|01 ; and a little|_|02 girl|_|05 was among 90|_|01 killed|_|02 during a concert|_|01 at one|_|05 of their local|_|03 venues|_|02 . as sad|_|02 as this all is , the most distressing|_|01 thing|_|04 is that the country|_|04 has decided|_|02 to activate|_|04 additional|_|03 measures|_|01 to ensure|_|10 their democracy|_|01 is maintained|_|04 . this always|_|01 seems|_|02 to be the case|_|01 during a time|_|03 of great|_|02 terror|_|04 and unrest- most of which are incited|_|02 by officials|_|01 working|_|03 within|_|02 the government|_|02 itself .
arnold|_|02 palmer|_|01 was really|_|01 a great|_|02 and ambitious|_|02 guy|_|03 , he really|_|01 did a monumental|_|02 change|_|05 nohow|_|01 today|_|02 's television|_|01 sports|_|05 work|_|01 , and the fact|_|04 that he died|_|06 was pretty|_|01 saddening|_|01 to me . i think|_|01 that the legacy|_|01 he left|_|12 behind|_|02 is amazing|_|01 , and he will continue|_|02 to influence|_|01 us|_|01 even|_|04 after his|_|01 death|_|01 . i would love|_|01 to see|_|03 arnold|_|02 palmer|_|01 's company|_|03 thrive|_|02 tremendously|_|01 over the next|_|03 couple|_|02 of decades|_|01 , and continue|_|02 to transpire|_|03 within|_|02 the people|_|03 he has influenced|_|01 in his|_|01 life|_|05 .
dear|_|04 friend|_|01 , i have just finished|_|01 reading|_|04 a very interesting|_|01 and somewhat|_|01 disturbing|_|11 article|_|04 . it was about thomas|_|05 arthur|_|02 , an inmate|_|01 on death|_|05 row|_|01 in alabama|_|02 . there began|_|07 a massive|_|04 legal|_|05 battle|_|01 between the courts|_|08 , justices|_|02 , and lawyers|_|01 about the legality|_|01 and morality|_|01 of lethal|_|02 injection|_|03 practices|_|04 . i feel|_|13 conflicted|_|02 because on one|_|06 hand|_|07 , these people|_|03 committed|_|18 unthinkable|_|01 crimes|_|02 and deserve|_|01 severe|_|06 punishment|_|01 , but on the other hand|_|07 , taking|_|04 a life|_|11 may|_|01 still|_|04 not be justifiable|_|01 .
nicolas mauro is the current|_|01 leader|_|01 of venezuela|_|01 and it has led|_|03 to major|_|01 issues|_|05 and divide|_|01 in the country|_|04 . the country|_|04 is pretty|_|01 much|_|01 tyrannical|_|02 at this point|_|23 and the government|_|03 is over - reaching|_|03 into everyone 's lives|_|01 . reading|_|03 about the protests|_|03 and issues|_|05 going|_|03 on makes|_|07 me feel|_|05 grateful|_|01 to be out of that country|_|04 . i really|_|01 hope|_|03 the people|_|01 can oust|_|02 him and replace|_|01 it with a better|_|01 government|_|03 .
did you hear|_|02 about the three|_|02 people|_|03 who died|_|04 on halloween|_|01 night|_|04 ? it happened|_|04 in mississippi|_|02 on a highway|_|01 . someone|_|01 hit|_|01 a trailer|_|04 that was pulling|_|17 people|_|03 on a highway|_|01 . several|_|01 people|_|03 were injured|_|01 , but three|_|02 were killed|_|01 . authorities|_|06 say|_|01 that the three|_|02 killed|_|01 were related|_|01 to one|_|06 another|_|01 . that is so sad|_|02 and breaks|_|01 my heart|_|01 . it was most likely|_|01 a family|_|01 , a mother|_|01 and her kids|_|02 , or a father|_|01 and his|_|01 kids|_|02 . it really|_|01 makes|_|03 me sad|_|02 when i read|_|03 about it because i can not help|_|05 but imagine|_|02 how much|_|01 fun|_|02 and excitement|_|01 this family|_|01 was experiencing|_|05 before the accident|_|02 happened|_|04 . the article|_|02 did not say|_|01 if the driver|_|02 who caused|_|01 the accident|_|02 was drunk|_|02 or on drugs|_|01 . i wish|_|03 people|_|03 were more alert|_|01 while on the road|_|01 . accidents|_|02 like|_|02 this are completely|_|01 preventable|_|01 . and now three|_|02 people|_|03 are no longer|_|01 with us|_|01 .
this article|_|04 was about the disturbing|_|11 finds|_|03 by the iraqi|_|01 military|_|03 as they re - captured|_|04 territory|_|03 from retreating|_|01 islamic|_|01 state|_|04 fighters|_|02 . they found|_|01 mass|_|03 graves|_|01 of people|_|01 killed|_|01 by isis|_|01 and although there is some confusion|_|02 about the details|_|02 , there are dozens|_|01 or maybe|_|01 over 100|_|01 bodies|_|09 . there is also|_|02 evidence|_|01 of torture|_|05 . the isis|_|01 fighters|_|02 were certainly|_|01 brutal|_|02 towards their victims|_|02 , and have captured|_|04 many|_|01 more to use|_|01 as human|_|03 shields|_|02 or to kill|_|01 outright|_|01 for their perceived|_|01 beliefs|_|01 .
the fact|_|03 that so many|_|01 people|_|03 still|_|01 die|_|02 of smoking|_|01 deaths|_|01 is unbelievable|_|01 . with so much|_|01 knowledge|_|01 these days|_|10 we should be able|_|04 to educate|_|01 people|_|03 about the danger|_|02 associated|_|01 with smoking|_|07 and change|_|01 this pattern|_|01 ! and the fact|_|03 that the who recommends|_|03 taxation|_|03 at 75|_|01 percent|_|01 of retail|_|02 cost|_|03 and no states|_|02 do this is crazy|_|05 !
i read|_|03 this article|_|02 about a bus|_|04 that was hit|_|02 a random|_|01 car|_|01 from out of nowhere|_|01 . the bus|_|04 was parked|_|02 and the car|_|01 just plowed|_|03 into it . it 's kind|_|01 of fucked|_|01 up but typical|_|01 . a few people|_|03 were hospitalized|_|01 but no one|_|02 died|_|04 . anyways|_|01 their investigating|_|02 the crash|_|03 . these types|_|06 of incidents|_|02 happen|_|04 so often|_|03 i 'm rather|_|02 numb|_|01 to their effects|_|03 .
this was heartbreaking|_|02 to read|_|06 . i ca|_|01 n't imagine|_|02 what it 's like|_|02 to leave|_|03 the house|_|01 every|_|02 day|_|01 not knowing|_|10 if you will come|_|04 back|_|01 , or of living|_|06 in fear|_|03 of letting|_|02 your children|_|01 leave|_|03 the house|_|01 to go|_|03 to school|_|05 because they might|_|01 not make|_|02 it home|_|01 . civilians|_|01 should not have to fear|_|03 for their lives|_|02 when they 're just trying|_|01 to get|_|02 through the day|_|01 . it sickens|_|04 me that the us|_|01 has participated|_|01 in strikes|_|05 that lead|_|03 to such consequences|_|03 .
i really|_|01 think|_|10 this is quite|_|01 sad|_|02 . poor|_|01 people|_|01 have the same sort|_|01 of problems|_|01 all over the world|_|08 . i think|_|10 this is because the rich|_|11 are always|_|02 keeping|_|19 people|_|01 down . i think|_|10 that they pretend|_|42 like|_|02 everything is a racial|_|01 struggle|_|03 , but i suspect|_|03 that the problems|_|01 we face|_|03 are largely|_|02 because the rich|_|11 are filthy|_|01 rich|_|11 and they have no empathy|_|01 for the rest|_|04 of us|_|01 .
i have not heard|_|02 of this story|_|03 , but wanted|_|01 to see|_|05 if you knew|_|05 anything about it . i know|_|05 we were talking|_|02 the other day|_|04 about being worried|_|03 about getting|_|01 stuck|_|01 in a situation|_|03 like|_|02 this because of all the recent|_|01 shootings|_|02 . i think|_|03 this story|_|03 was a real|_|03 eye|_|03 opener|_|02 for me , because it shows|_|10 just how easy|_|03 something like|_|02 this happening|_|04 would be . i feel|_|05 that what you said|_|01 about mental|_|05 health|_|02 and paying|_|10 more attention|_|05 to the youth|_|06 is really|_|01 another|_|01 central|_|02 point|_|18 to this story|_|03 . this story|_|03 made|_|17 me think|_|03 even|_|01 more about owning a gun|_|02 and having a open|_|05 carry|_|01 permit|_|01 to keep|_|04 safe|_|02 and be able|_|01 to protect|_|01 my loved|_|02 ones|_|02 and family|_|01 .
i ca|_|01 n't stand|_|04 these jenner|_|01 and guardianship|_|02 . but i have to give|_|04 them credit|_|03 for making|_|02 a living|_|02 from doing nothing|_|01 . i guess|_|02 that is the new|_|01 american|_|01 dream|_|05 ! t hey are producing|_|03 a product|_|04 that people|_|01 want|_|05 to consume|_|03 . is n't that sick|_|01 ? the crazy|_|03 thing|_|08 is that this family|_|01 is going|_|04 to become|_|04 the normal|_|04 and accepted|_|03 family|_|01 environment|_|01 .
i am so glad|_|03 that i 'm not a celebrity|_|01 having my every|_|02 move|_|01 made|_|48 public|_|01 and being analyzed|_|02 . it would be awful|_|01 to be under that constant|_|01 and never|_|01 ending|_|01 scrutiny|_|02 . the thought|_|01 of being under the constant|_|01 watchful|_|01 eye|_|05 of the world|_|01 , and them profiting|_|02 from a me having a bad|_|01 day|_|04 makes|_|48 my stomach|_|03 turn|_|06 . i feel|_|01 bad|_|01 for him in a way|_|02 , i 've had a few rocky|_|09 relationships|_|02 and i could n't imagine|_|02 going|_|15 through them publicly|_|02 .
i think|_|03 they should both be charged|_|03 with murder|_|01 . it 's obvious|_|01 at least|_|01 one|_|05 of them did it but i 'm assuming|_|06 both . it 's crazy|_|05 what this world|_|08 has come|_|02 to people|_|01 just killing|_|01 people|_|01 all the time|_|06 and usually|_|01 for no reason|_|06 . it 's crazy|_|05 and people|_|01 need|_|01 to be punished|_|01 harsher|_|06 . if you kill|_|01 someone|_|01 on person|_|01 for no reason|_|06 you should automatically|_|01 get|_|01 the death|_|06 sentence|_|01 .
well|_|03 , this certainly|_|01 is rich|_|11 and pathetic|_|03 . the muslims|_|01 and their terrorist|_|01 mouthpiece|_|06 council|_|03 on american|_|01 - islamic|_|01 relations|_|01 are all whiny|_|02 that someone|_|01 tried|_|01 to do to them what they have been doing to everyone else|_|01 all over the world|_|08 . never|_|02 hear|_|04 a word|_|07 out of them when they 're blowing|_|01 up cars|_|04 and shooting|_|03 up innocent|_|05 people|_|01 in the streets|_|05 do you ?
the person|_|01 in the article|_|04 was participating|_|01 in a fund|_|02 raising|_|04 event|_|03 and the event|_|03 was about getting|_|01 pies|_|01 thrown|_|01 into the faces|_|01 by people|_|01 . i guess|_|02 that things|_|05 got|_|01 a little|_|01 bit|_|04 rough|_|02 because the guy|_|03 that was getting|_|01 the pie|_|01 in the face|_|08 got|_|01 injured|_|01 somehow|_|02 . it was pretty|_|01 bad|_|01 and he had to seek|_|01 out the medical|_|02 help|_|01 for the injuries|_|02 to his|_|01 face|_|08 .
this situation|_|02 i read|_|06 about concerning|_|02 refugees|_|01 fleeing|_|01 to mediterranean|_|01 countries|_|02 such as greece|_|02 and italy|_|01 is sad|_|02 and concerns|_|04 me . clearly|_|01 the conditions|_|01 in their native|_|03 countries|_|02 have gotten|_|18 to be so unbearable|_|01 that they are willing|_|01 to risk|_|01 their own and their families|_|01 ' lives|_|03 to try|_|01 for a different|_|02 life|_|03 in another|_|01 country|_|02 , with no guarantee|_|03 that life|_|03 there would be an improvement|_|03 . its difficult|_|02 to understand|_|01 . life|_|03 must|_|01 be so terrible|_|02 in these countries|_|02 due|_|02 to horrendous|_|02 governance|_|02 , which i suppose|_|01 is something difficult|_|02 for the typical|_|03 american|_|02 to picture|_|02 . i 'm glad|_|02 that we live|_|07 in a country|_|02 where there are relative|_|01 freedoms|_|01 and the individual|_|01 and his|_|01 or her family|_|01 can live|_|07 independently|_|02 and get|_|18 their needs|_|02 met|_|04 and wants|_|02 . living|_|07 in fear|_|03 is no way|_|01 to live|_|07 .
the girl|_|02 with the beautiful|_|01 green|_|04 eyes|_|05 that was pictured|_|02 years|_|03 ago|_|01 by a photographer|_|01 is currently|_|02 under arrest|_|02 for falsifying|_|02 documents|_|01 to stay|_|04 in pakistan|_|01 . i feel|_|13 bad|_|01 for this woman|_|02 who felt|_|03 a need|_|02 to lie|_|01 about her status|_|01 of citizenship|_|02 to stay|_|04 in a country|_|02 just to continue|_|04 living|_|01 a better|_|12 life|_|02 . this is the second|_|01 time|_|04 she has been arrested|_|07 which shows|_|02 me that she is really|_|01 trying|_|01 to escape|_|01 a war|_|04 ravaged|_|01 country|_|02 and to continue|_|04 on living|_|01 a better|_|12 life|_|02 . they should let|_|03 the girl|_|02 go|_|03 . good|_|03 for the original|_|01 photographer|_|01 who is trying|_|01 to help|_|05 her out of this situation|_|01 .
wow|_|02 , it is scary|_|01 to think|_|03 there are mice|_|01 that are twice|_|01 their normal|_|04 size|_|02 hunting|_|03 down and killing|_|02 birds|_|01 ! it must|_|01 be one|_|05 scary|_|01 place|_|01 there right|_|01 now with all that carnage|_|03 . i hope|_|03 keith can make|_|03 his|_|01 plan|_|02 come|_|04 alive|_|07 and stop|_|01 the invasion|_|03 of the mice|_|01 . my concern|_|04 is if they start|_|08 getting|_|02 off the island|_|02 and migrating|_|01 to other places|_|01 . i live|_|07 far|_|03 away|_|01 in america|_|01 , but i sure|_|01 do n't want|_|03 to run|_|03 across|_|02 these giant|_|01 bird|_|01 - eating|_|06 mice|_|01 . no thanks|_|02 !
this shows|_|12 how the current|_|01 political|_|02 environment|_|02 is effecting|_|02 people|_|01 , especially|_|01 younger|_|01 people|_|01 , emotionally|_|02 . the stress|_|01 and fear|_|03 that is being shown|_|12 from the younger|_|01 generation|_|01 is mostly|_|01 to blame|_|03 on social|_|04 media|_|02 . we used|_|06 to be able|_|04 to discuss|_|02 political|_|02 issues|_|02 in person|_|03 , calmly|_|01 . now , if you try|_|01 to mention|_|01 your opinion|_|01 on social|_|04 media|_|02 , you run|_|01 the risk|_|04 of being attacked|_|01 or insulted|_|01 , simply|_|03 adding|_|02 to the fear|_|03 of the current|_|01 political|_|02 situations|_|01 .
bullying|_|02 is such a serious|_|02 issue|_|02 . it has been going|_|01 on for so long|_|01 . it is so sad|_|02 that these young|_|01 people|_|03 have to take|_|05 their life|_|01 because they think|_|10 there is no end|_|14 in sight|_|02 . what we need|_|01 to do along|_|04 with providing|_|07 therapy|_|01 for those that are bullied|_|02 is to increase|_|02 the consequences|_|01 for those who are bullying|_|02 others . this may|_|01 have happened|_|01 in europe|_|01 but in america|_|01 teachers|_|02 know|_|01 this bullying|_|01 is going|_|01 on and they tend|_|03 to protect|_|02 the football|_|02 players|_|05 and other jocks|_|01 . it is really|_|01 sad|_|02 . i hope|_|03 you have never|_|02 been bullied|_|02 . i was and it was terrible|_|01 .
wow|_|02 how sad|_|02 is this news|_|01 ? i 'm glad|_|03 that people|_|01 rallied|_|01 together|_|03 to help|_|01 those people|_|01 at least|_|01 . this really|_|01 reminds|_|01 me of when i lived|_|07 in texas|_|01 and everyone was having their homes|_|01 and land|_|02 ruined|_|02 by wild|_|01 fires|_|01 that went|_|01 out of control|_|02 . people|_|01 lost|_|11 everything but luckily|_|01 everyone really|_|01 teamed|_|01 up to help|_|01 each other .
oh|_|01 my goodness|_|02 , did you read|_|06 this article|_|04 ? it was heart|_|01 - wrenching|_|03 ... i felt|_|03 so sad|_|02 while reading|_|06 it and my heart|_|01 breaks|_|02 for the mother|_|01 of these babies|_|04 . there is no way|_|01 that a parent|_|01 should ever|_|01 , ever|_|01 have to lose|_|03 a child|_|03 , much|_|04 less|_|01 two|_|01 children|_|03 at the same time|_|02 . so horrifying|_|02 and sad|_|02 ! something has to be done about all of this . they deserve|_|01 justice|_|02 ! !
i just do n't know|_|10 how they could do this to that poor|_|06 girl|_|02 . after everything she has been through . i really|_|01 feel|_|05 for her . i understand|_|01 what she might|_|01 be going|_|03 through . it is a shame|_|02 to have this happen|_|04 after all this time|_|04 . i really|_|01 hope|_|03 that someone|_|01 will be able|_|01 to help|_|01 her . i feel|_|05 really|_|01 bad|_|01 about what is being done . i am worried|_|01 about what might|_|01 happen|_|04 if she does n't get|_|01 any help|_|02 . they really|_|01 should just let|_|02 her go|_|03 .
every|_|02 time|_|02 i hear|_|04 something about isis|_|01 , i ca|_|01 n't help|_|01 but think|_|03 about the role|_|03 the us|_|01 played|_|22 in its creation|_|02 and the horrors|_|02 that have come|_|01 from the vacuum|_|03 of power|_|04 in the region|_|01 . i 'm thankful|_|01 to be american|_|02 when i read|_|06 something like|_|02 this , but also|_|02 ashamed|_|01 at the same time|_|02 in who we 've chosen|_|03 to represent|_|03 us|_|01 , not just now , but over the past|_|01 30|_|01 years|_|03 .
i ca|_|01 n't believe|_|01 that there has to be so much|_|01 violence|_|03 and bad|_|09 in the world|_|03 . the part|_|01 of this article|_|01 that really|_|01 got|_|01 to me was that the muslim|_|01 women|_|01 were being raped|_|07 and that doctors|_|01 and nurses|_|01 who wanted|_|05 to help|_|01 the people|_|01 there were being treated|_|03 rudely|_|01 . it would be awful|_|02 to have to live|_|07 under these kinds|_|01 of conditions|_|07 . it would be awful|_|02 to have the prices|_|02 of food|_|03 go|_|01 up because of blockades|_|02 and other reasons|_|06 . it would be stressful|_|01 and scary|_|01 .
hello|_|01 , dear|_|03 group|_|03 . let|_|01 's trust|_|04 in the laws|_|01 of our country|_|04 and in truly|_|01 just judgments|_|03 . hopefully|_|01 the murderer|_|01 accused|_|02 of five|_|01 counts|_|03 of murder|_|01 will not be free|_|01 and quiet|_|02 in the streets|_|05 of this country|_|04 . i hope|_|03 that justice|_|02 can compensate|_|01 a little|_|01 to the relatives|_|01 of the victim|_|02 . after a 24|_|01 - hour|_|04 chase|_|03 the police|_|01 found|_|03 the criminal|_|01 and even|_|04 though|_|01 the victims|_|02 have not been recognized|_|02 , they will soon|_|01 discover|_|02 who they are .
can you imagine|_|02 what kind|_|01 of heartache|_|01 these people|_|01 must|_|01 be going|_|03 through ? i do n't know|_|05 what it would be like|_|02 to have to live|_|02 in fear|_|03 that your own country|_|02 is going|_|03 to be bombed|_|07 , let|_|02 alone|_|02 receiving|_|03 a messages|_|02 basically|_|01 telling|_|02 you that if you do n't get|_|02 out now you could die|_|01 from a bombing|_|02 . politics|_|05 is making|_|02 life|_|05 so hard|_|01 for so many|_|01 innocent|_|04 people|_|01 .
a lot|_|05 of these news|_|01 go|_|01 unnoticed|_|01 i feel|_|05 . we have war|_|03 in syria|_|01 and war|_|03 everywhere|_|01 . we have accepted|_|03 it as a part|_|01 of the world|_|01 . it 's such a shame|_|01 that it 's like|_|04 this . conflict|_|01 has always|_|04 broken|_|02 us|_|01 down and it 's never|_|02 been necessary|_|02 . i do n't know|_|05 for how long|_|01 this war|_|03 has to continue|_|02 . but i really|_|01 feel|_|05 sorry|_|01 for all the lives|_|01 that 's been lost|_|11 in this conflict|_|01 .
wow|_|02 , killing|_|05 someone|_|01 in public|_|02 ? that takes|_|02 some serious|_|01 nerve|_|03 . i do n't particularly|_|01 know|_|01 whether she is guilty|_|02 or not , but for it to be played|_|22 out in the media|_|10 is n't fair|_|04 . while they may|_|01 not have the same protections|_|01 that the accused|_|02 have in the united|_|01 states|_|04 , they should still|_|04 give|_|01 her a new|_|11 trial|_|04 , something quiet|_|02 , out of the public|_|02 eye|_|05 , maybe|_|01 even|_|01 outside|_|01 of the country|_|04 , where she can get|_|02 a fair|_|04 trial|_|04 based|_|02 on the facts|_|03 . if there is video|_|01 of her spiking|_|02 the coffee|_|03 , or any indication|_|03 that she has had any contact|_|08 with cyanide|_|01 , then i say|_|01 she should get|_|02 a retrial|_|01 .
i think|_|01 justice|_|02 has been served|_|07 one|_|05 way|_|01 or another|_|01 . this person|_|01 seemed|_|02 like|_|02 a danger|_|02 to society|_|02 . i think|_|01 it 's only right|_|04 they should meet|_|10 their end|_|10 in this fashion|_|01 . people|_|01 like|_|02 this should be removed|_|08 from society|_|02 before they do something that will hurt|_|06 others . i feel|_|07 bad|_|01 for anyone who was in danger|_|02 from this mad|_|02 man|_|08 .
" i can not believe|_|01 canada|_|01 took|_|29 so many|_|01 native|_|03 people|_|03 and put|_|04 them in their " " proper|_|04 " " schools|_|05 . they took|_|29 away|_|01 their language|_|01 and their heritage|_|04 . and on top|_|09 of all that 6000 died|_|04 ! plus|_|04 many|_|01 were abused|_|01 ! this is horrible|_|03 ! i am so upset|_|01 by this ! i mean|_|04 seriously|_|01 ? how could they do that ! and the worst|_|01 part|_|01 is that was still|_|04 going|_|04 on all the way|_|12 up to 1996 ! ! ! that is insane|_|01 ! and they only apologized|_|02 in 2008 . way|_|12 too late|_|06 . i mean|_|04 the harm|_|01 they did to these children|_|04 is massive|_|04 . they need|_|01 to make|_|08 up for what they have done ! "
i think|_|10 it is important|_|05 to ensure|_|10 safe|_|02 drivers|_|05 on our roads|_|02 , for our family|_|01 ’s sake|_|01 . i believe|_|01 that the rate|_|04 of accidents|_|02 on american|_|02 roads|_|02 is far|_|01 higher|_|07 than acceptable|_|02 . i believe|_|01 there should be more restrictive|_|02 driving|_|01 requirements|_|01 and testing|_|07 , as well|_|01 as harsher|_|06 punishments|_|01 for drivers|_|05 who do not respect|_|01 the riles|_|02 of the road|_|02 .
what a rare|_|06 occurrence|_|02 to have that mutation|_|03 come|_|05 up for both parents|_|01 . i feel|_|05 very bad|_|01 for nicholas|_|01 and his|_|01 family|_|02 . thankfully|_|02 they are able|_|04 to afford|_|01 the treatments|_|03 that nicholas|_|01 would need|_|03 almost|_|07 his|_|01 entire|_|02 life|_|13 . i feel|_|05 bad|_|01 for the family|_|02 who are n't able|_|04 to afford|_|01 such treatments|_|03 for their own kids|_|02 .

hi|_|01 , i have learned|_|01 that syria|_|01 ’s war|_|01 escalated|_|01 abruptly|_|01 on friday|_|01 . government|_|02 forces|_|01 and their russian|_|01 allies|_|02 launched|_|02 ferocious|_|01 aerial|_|02 assaults|_|03 on aleppo|_|01 . repeated|_|01 airstrikes destroyed|_|04 buildings|_|07 and engulfed|_|01 neighborhoods|_|02 , and flames|_|03 killed|_|01 about 100|_|01 people|_|03 there . what is gained|_|01 with this senseless|_|01 violence|_|01 ?
i dint|_|01 even|_|04 bother|_|04 reading|_|01 this . i skimmed|_|07 it . it 's a meaningless|_|01 bore|_|01 . why in writing|_|10 you to tell|_|02 you this is beyond|_|03 me , but my masters|_|01 here believe|_|01 it will be revealing|_|02 in some way|_|11 . and in nothing|_|01 if not a slave|_|03 to my masters|_|01 . so i write|_|10 . to you , my friends|_|01 . i hope|_|03 you will find|_|02 more meaningful|_|01 things|_|08 to read|_|01 and do than this kind|_|01 of crap|_|01 .

i just read|_|03 an article|_|02 about famed|_|01 basketball|_|02 star|_|03 , scottie|_|01 pippin|_|01 . someone|_|01 thought|_|03 it was new|_|01 worthy|_|03 to make|_|02 the world|_|08 aware|_|01 that he and his|_|01 wife|_|01 got|_|02 into a screaming|_|02 match|_|01 and she was afraid|_|04 . the truth|_|05 is , no one|_|02 but their family|_|08 knows|_|01 what 's really|_|01 going|_|04 on . his|_|01 wife|_|01 could be a very dramatic|_|02 person|_|01 . she could be giving|_|04 him a hard|_|03 time|_|01 . while domestic|_|03 violence|_|01 and emotional|_|06 abuse|_|02 should never|_|01 be tolerated|_|03 , we should leave|_|06 people|_|01 to deal|_|01 with their own screaming|_|01 matches|_|01 .
these are problems|_|01 that us|_|01 solider|_|01 had to deal|_|03 with for many|_|01 year|_|03 . hell|_|02 , you could even|_|03 go|_|03 back|_|03 much|_|05 , much|_|05 further|_|05 if you want|_|05 to . war|_|04 is hell|_|02 , and it can -- and often|_|03 does -- do a ringer|_|01 to your psyche|_|01 and overall|_|02 mental|_|05 health|_|02 . that 's why we as a society|_|04 need|_|02 to pump|_|08 more resources|_|03 into mental|_|05 health|_|02 as we do physical|_|02 health|_|02 .
say|_|01 , bigots|_|01 ! i know|_|10 that bigots|_|01 are not a particularly|_|01 new|_|05 species|_|01 , but i used|_|01 to think|_|01 , just a few years|_|02 ago|_|01 , that things|_|07 were much|_|04 better|_|21 and that people|_|03 were generally|_|01 becoming|_|04 more open|_|05 - minded|_|02 and welcoming|_|03 . but the election|_|02 of our new|_|05 president|_|02 signals|_|03 something very different|_|01 . and very much|_|01 encourages|_|01 the bigots|_|01 to spread|_|02 their wings|_|01 and parade|_|02 proudly|_|01 . they are being empowered|_|01 right|_|04 now , and that is very disturbing|_|11 .
there have just been so many|_|01 different|_|01 tragedies|_|02 involving|_|01 the sinking|_|03 of migrant|_|01 boats|_|01 that the people|_|01 who live|_|01 in western|_|03 countries|_|02 have become|_|04 immunized|_|02 to the images|_|01 . i just wonder|_|03 how people|_|01 so close|_|01 by in european|_|01 countries|_|02 can have an anti|_|01 - refugee|_|01 position|_|10 ( though|_|01 they call|_|07 them migrants|_|01 ) when the evidence|_|03 of tragedy|_|02 is before them every|_|02 year|_|03 since the syrian|_|01 war|_|01 heated|_|04 up . i think|_|10 it is really|_|01 just crazy|_|01 .
i canto|_|02 believe|_|01 that there are citizens|_|01 in this county|_|01 , particularly|_|01 in minnesota|_|01 , who are vulnerable|_|03 enough|_|01 to be manipulated|_|02 by isis|_|01 to kill|_|01 individuals|_|01 in their country|_|04 . the somali|_|01 group|_|01 in minnesota|_|01 has a history|_|02 ( several|_|03 known|_|01 cases|_|06 ) of people|_|01 attempting|_|01 to commit|_|01 murder|_|01 for the terrorist|_|01 group|_|01 . tragically|_|01 , an somali|_|01 man|_|08 has just gone|_|01 on a murder|_|01 spree|_|01 . he has not been linked|_|02 to isis|_|01 and his|_|01 motivations|_|03 are unclear|_|02 , but i am disturbed|_|11 .
wow|_|02 , what a horrible|_|03 and terrifying|_|01 accident|_|02 , i feel|_|05 very bad|_|01 for the people|_|03 involved|_|07 and their families|_|01 . i wonder|_|03 what caused|_|01 this terrible|_|01 accident|_|02 , i hope|_|03 that it was not any human|_|03 error|_|01 , because that makes|_|08 it worse|_|01 to deal|_|01 with . i can not imagine|_|02 being on that train|_|05 and the intensity|_|06 of the accident|_|02 . it makes|_|08 me feel|_|05 very sad|_|02 thinking|_|02 about the deaths|_|06 of those people|_|03 on board|_|02 .

these migrant|_|01 camps|_|08 are getting|_|01 more and more reminiscent|_|01 of internment|_|01 camps|_|08 by the day|_|01 . for a country|_|02 that prides|_|01 itself on being so civilized|_|02 , i ca|_|01 n't imagine|_|02 how french|_|01 citizens|_|01 can accept|_|02 the treatment|_|03 of the camp|_|08 's children|_|03 and others who remain|_|04 behind|_|02 in appalling|_|02 conditions|_|03 . have a little|_|03 compassion|_|02 for your fellow|_|01 human|_|03 beings , please|_|03 .
i do n't understand|_|01 what i read|_|03 here . the students|_|01 were hijacking|_|02 buses|_|01 ? what the hell|_|04 ? regardless|_|01 , the local|_|02 police|_|01 should not have turned|_|10 them over to a drug|_|01 cartel|_|04 . i 'm sure|_|08 they are probably|_|01 dead|_|16 by now , but i support|_|09 the family|_|02 finding|_|01 out what happened|_|01 and get|_|01 justice|_|02 . they were kids|_|02 , they did n't deserve|_|01 to be killed|_|02 for this .
my feelings|_|02 and thoughts|_|01 regarding|_|05 the article|_|04 i just read|_|06 , is what i want|_|01 to sit|_|01 down and compose|_|01 a brief|_|02 message|_|01 to you , in regards|_|03 to it . i think|_|02 that the greenhouse|_|01 effect|_|02 is highly|_|01 over - rated|_|01 . i find|_|05 that the forces|_|04 that oppose|_|01 and are against it , has a strong|_|02 point|_|03 . as well|_|03 , those in favor|_|04 of it is also|_|02 right|_|03 , and just to want|_|01 and seek|_|01 and work|_|03 towards ways|_|05 that would be in the best|_|03 interest|_|01 of our lives|_|13 and our environment|_|02 . i believe|_|01 it they would not show|_|12 any interest|_|01 , then whatever|_|01 the harmful|_|01 effects|_|02 would only increase|_|01 . those in opposition|_|01 , who feel|_|05 that it 's just an umbrella|_|01 word|_|02 to funnel|_|01 monies in areas|_|01 that are not needed|_|02 . that believe|_|01 mother|_|01 nature|_|03 and the natural|_|01 state|_|02 of how our earth|_|05 and it 's environment|_|02 works|_|01 , are also|_|02 somewhat|_|01 correct|_|03 . i wish|_|04 each would meet|_|04 halfway|_|02 .
it 's upsetting|_|06 that species|_|01 are dying|_|04 out , sometimes|_|01 before we even|_|01 know|_|01 they exist|_|02 . i wonder|_|01 if there are ways|_|11 we can use|_|01 science|_|02 to bring|_|04 them back|_|06 , if they even|_|01 survive|_|02 if we do . we need|_|01 to take|_|35 better|_|13 care|_|06 of the environment|_|02 . it 's worrying|_|02 that as these species|_|01 die|_|04 out , someday|_|01 ours might|_|01 as well|_|01 .
those poor|_|06 officers|_|01 . like|_|02 in any group|_|03 of people|_|01 , there are good|_|13 and bad|_|09 ones|_|02 . in this society|_|01 the tendency|_|01 to demonize|_|01 everyone for the actions|_|01 of a few sets|_|05 a very dangerous|_|02 precedent|_|01 and things|_|09 like|_|02 this can happen|_|03 . every|_|01 person|_|01 should be judged|_|02 on their own merits|_|01 . saying|_|01 all cops|_|05 are bad|_|09 because of what a few have done is so insane|_|01 and the public|_|01 outrage|_|02 leads|_|05 to things|_|09 like|_|02 this . i do n't know|_|04 for sure|_|07 what this person|_|01 's motivations|_|01 were but there have been enough|_|02 instances|_|01 that some do n't see|_|01 law|_|01 enforcement|_|01 as people|_|01 anymore|_|01 and it makes|_|43 their job|_|01 so much|_|04 more dangerous|_|02 and we need|_|01 good|_|13 cops|_|05 to do their jobs|_|01 to keep|_|09 us|_|01 safe|_|04 .
hey friend|_|01 . did you hear|_|02 about this weird|_|01 terrifying|_|01 story|_|02 of some british|_|01 banker|_|02 who wanted|_|01 seemed|_|02 to want|_|01 to copy|_|02 the american|_|01 psycho|_|01 movie|_|01 ? he murdered|_|01 two|_|01 women|_|02 and if not for them panicking|_|02 , they would have been tortured|_|02 . he was a sick|_|01 depraved|_|01 individual|_|04 . i do n't know|_|05 how people|_|01 like|_|02 this live|_|05 in our society|_|03 . they are all hidden|_|03 under the surface|_|04 .
hey man|_|08 can you believe|_|01 that again the sea|_|03 ice|_|01 is at its lowest|_|02 level|_|01 again ! i just read|_|06 an article|_|04 on it and it seems|_|02 like|_|02 it keeps|_|02 going|_|01 lower|_|01 and lower|_|02 . i feel|_|05 really|_|01 worried|_|06 for animals|_|01 that depend|_|01 on the sea|_|03 ice|_|01 , polar|_|02 bears|_|02 i think|_|02 really|_|01 need|_|03 it . plus|_|04 i read|_|06 how it can have a really|_|01 bad|_|01 impact|_|02 on our climate|_|02 because the ice|_|01 reflects|_|01 so much|_|01 of the sun|_|03 's energy|_|05 without it even|_|01 more heat|_|01 from the sun|_|03 gets|_|01 in and does n't get|_|01 reflected|_|01 . definitely|_|01 something to watch|_|02 and worry|_|06 about .
this was a tough|_|03 article|_|04 to read|_|06 because if you put|_|01 yourself in that place|_|12 , and you think|_|01 of yourself losing|_|01 a friend|_|01 that is very close|_|01 to you or a family|_|08 friend|_|01 . i know|_|11 that whenever i think|_|01 about not having someone|_|01 that has been close|_|01 to me i wonder|_|02 how i would feel|_|05 or react|_|01 . i do n't think|_|01 that we let|_|01 people|_|01 know|_|11 how we feel|_|05 enough|_|01 .
this guy|_|03 that i just read|_|08 about seriously|_|01 can not be trusted|_|06 . he was going|_|01 around|_|04 acting|_|01 like|_|02 an apartment|_|01 belonged|_|01 to him when it did not in actuality|_|01 . i wonder|_|02 will he be punished|_|01 sufficiently|_|01 . i doubt|_|02 it . he will probable|_|02 just strike|_|05 a deal|_|08 and that will be the end|_|05 of it . he needs|_|02 to be publicly|_|02 shamed|_|03 .
did you see|_|05 this article|_|04 about the protest|_|01 in mi|_|02 ? it 's so crazy|_|03 how divisive|_|01 the country|_|04 has become|_|01 over the election|_|04 and how president|_|02 rump|_|02 's doing . what used|_|04 to be considered|_|01 rare|_|05 and unacceptable|_|04 seems|_|02 now to become|_|01 the norm|_|01 , since all the crazy|_|03 things|_|09 trump|_|02 says|_|01 and does . throwing|_|02 a firecracker|_|01 into a crowd|_|01 ? who does that and thinks|_|03 its acceptable|_|02 ? people|_|01 these days|_|01 are getting|_|01 very crazy|_|03 .
you are not going|_|01 to believe|_|01 this article|_|04 i just read|_|03 about something akin|_|02 to torture|_|02 , called|_|01 conversion|_|09 therapy|_|01 . it 's something , designed|_|07 by quacks|_|02 , that is supposed|_|02 to convert|_|02 gay|_|01 or queer|_|01 people|_|01 to heterosexual|_|01 . are you kidding|_|01 me ? people|_|01 are who they are in life|_|05 and are not to be changed|_|06 , but embraced|_|01 and supported|_|01 . the regimen|_|01 these poor|_|01 people|_|01 had to go|_|01 through in this so called|_|01 therapy|_|01 was barbaric|_|02 , and would not be used|_|06 in north|_|02 korea|_|01 as a torture|_|05 . it 's unbelievable|_|01 what people|_|01 do in the name|_|06 of helping|_|01 .
did you finally|_|01 see|_|01 what happened|_|01 to that sicko that stole|_|01 all of those nude|_|01 photos|_|01 from those celebrities|_|01 ? those poor|_|06 people|_|01 got|_|04 tricked|_|01 into getting|_|04 their photos|_|01 stolen|_|01 and this man|_|08 went|_|01 and was showing|_|01 them to everyone . he finally|_|01 was convicted|_|01 of this and it serves|_|01 him right|_|01 . what an idiot|_|01 . just remember|_|07 you do n't ever|_|01 take|_|29 any photos|_|01 like|_|02 this and never|_|01 upload|_|01 them even|_|01 if you did . keep|_|02 this stuff|_|05 private|_|05 and off of the internet|_|01 . i sure|_|01 am glad|_|01 this guy|_|01 finally|_|01 got|_|04 what was coming|_|04 to him .
i think|_|01 there are way|_|11 to many|_|01 people|_|01 watching|_|06 cnn in this country|_|04 . they need|_|02 to grow|_|01 up . people|_|01 are way|_|11 to sensitive|_|02 . we can not walk|_|01 around|_|04 on egg|_|01 shells|_|05 worrying|_|06 about if we are going|_|03 to offend|_|05 someone|_|01 . people|_|01 will say|_|01 mean|_|02 things|_|08 . people|_|01 will hurt|_|05 your feelings|_|02 . grow|_|01 up and get|_|02 over it . do n't let|_|01 it bother|_|01 you . these people|_|01 do not rule|_|04 your life|_|01 . you do !
educational|_|02 videos|_|01 can be helpful|_|01 , but this seems|_|02 rather|_|01 silly|_|01 to me . i would not consider|_|05 applying|_|01 make|_|43 up on a train|_|01 a pet|_|01 peeve|_|01 and i 'm surprised|_|01 it was on a list|_|04 of complaints|_|04 from other people|_|03 . but we have to remember|_|07 that this is a different|_|03 culture|_|06 as well|_|07 so may|_|01 be seen|_|05 as something negative|_|03 in japan|_|04 . i would agree|_|01 on the issue|_|02 of beauty|_|03 that was mentioned|_|01 in the article|_|04 . it should n't be biased|_|02 , only informative|_|01 .
wildfires|_|01 in the western|_|02 area|_|06 of north|_|02 carolina|_|01 , in the appalachian|_|01 mountains|_|02 , can get|_|01 so large|_|06 they can be seen|_|10 from space|_|08 . in fact|_|04 , some of the wildfires|_|01 in neighboring|_|02 southern|_|01 states|_|04 can produce|_|03 enough|_|02 smoke|_|02 to cover|_|01 areas|_|06 of south|_|01 carolina|_|01 . despite|_|02 not actually|_|02 having a fire|_|03 there , the smoke|_|02 can get|_|01 so thick|_|03 that it takes|_|27 heavy|_|13 rain|_|03 to make|_|03 it dissipate|_|01 .
i really|_|01 did n't realize|_|02 how quickly|_|01 climate|_|02 change|_|06 could have an effect|_|01 on certain|_|06 areas|_|01 of the world|_|08 . i do believe|_|01 that climate|_|02 change|_|06 is being caused|_|01 by humans|_|02 to a good|_|13 extent|_|02 , but i 'm not sure|_|06 if negative|_|08 impacts|_|02 will come|_|11 as quickly|_|01 as some people|_|01 speculate|_|04 . it 's very interesting|_|01 but i am concerned|_|02 for the safety|_|01 of some people|_|01 if things|_|08 continue|_|02 this way|_|11 .
" hey , remember|_|07 that eighties|_|01 song|_|01 " " you spin|_|02 me right|_|12 round|_|11 " " that people|_|03 like|_|02 to laugh|_|01 about ? the guy|_|03 responsible|_|02 for that just dies|_|03 recently|_|01 , he seemed|_|02 like|_|02 he was pretty|_|01 interesting|_|01 . i heard|_|02 that he was on the uk|_|01 version|_|06 of celebrity|_|01 big|_|01 brother|_|01 , but i bet|_|08 that show|_|03 is just as boring|_|01 as the american|_|01 version|_|06 . it 's so interesting|_|01 how the celebrity|_|01 culture|_|02 over there compares|_|04 to over here . "
wow|_|02 , i just read|_|08 an article|_|04 that says|_|01 coconuts|_|03 could be in danger|_|02 of becoming|_|02 much|_|01 more scarce|_|01 . there is a bacteria|_|01 going|_|01 around|_|02 that causes|_|02 lethal|_|02 yellowing|_|01 and wipes|_|01 them out . due|_|03 to the water|_|02 concentration|_|01 , a traditional|_|02 seed|_|03 bank|_|10 is not an option|_|02 . you would have to have a living|_|06 gene|_|01 bank|_|10 . that would affect|_|01 a lot|_|05 of companies|_|03 and industries|_|01 .
another|_|01 taliban|_|01 attack|_|09 in afghanistan|_|01 today|_|01 , this time|_|03 directed|_|01 against the germans|_|02 . a few dead|_|10 and many|_|01 wounded|_|01 , primarily|_|02 women|_|02 and children|_|01 . they said|_|01 it was in retaliation|_|01 against us|_|01 air|_|01 strikes|_|02 that have cause|_|02 a lot|_|05 of civilian|_|01 casualties|_|01 . an endless|_|01 cycle|_|03 , just like|_|02 before . remind|_|01 me again why we 're there .
i just read|_|03 an article|_|04 on how many|_|01 civilians|_|01 are killed|_|08 by airstrikes by nato|_|01 forces|_|01 . this is a major|_|08 issue|_|01 because the mainstream|_|01 media|_|02 never|_|02 report|_|04 these stories|_|03 . the media|_|02 only paints|_|01 nato|_|01 as the good|_|01 guys|_|03 and never|_|02 in a bad|_|01 light|_|09 . they can commit|_|01 acts|_|05 that can be deemed|_|01 a war|_|04 crime|_|01 but as long|_|02 as they are the authority|_|02 they do not need|_|02 to be accounted|_|01 for .
the story|_|03 about what is going|_|03 on currently|_|02 in venezuela|_|01 is devastating|_|01 . it is almost|_|07 haunting|_|01 and definitely|_|01 disturbing|_|11 . the economic|_|04 crisis|_|01 that is happening|_|01 there is not only affecting|_|01 people|_|01 , but also|_|02 the animals|_|01 that live|_|02 there . especially|_|01 in the zoos|_|02 . we do n't often|_|03 let|_|01 how a crisis|_|01 in countries|_|02 can affect|_|01 animals|_|01 cross|_|01 our minds|_|05 , we typically|_|01 only think|_|01 of the people|_|01 . not only is directly|_|04 affecting|_|01 the animals|_|01 in the way|_|11 that they are being fed|_|06 diets|_|03 that are drastically|_|01 different|_|01 from they should be consuming|_|02 , but the people|_|01 there are having to hunt|_|01 animals|_|01 that we would not typically|_|01 deem|_|01 acceptable|_|02 . such as cats|_|01 , and dogs|_|02 , and even|_|01 going|_|03 as far|_|05 as to steal|_|03 horses|_|01 from racetracks|_|01 simply|_|02 to eat|_|06 them , or to feed|_|03 them to animals|_|01 at the local|_|03 zoos|_|02 . many|_|01 animals|_|01 have suffered|_|02 for weeks|_|01 .
hey , zambia|_|01 is protecting|_|02 elephants|_|02 on a massive|_|04 refuge|_|02 type|_|06 area|_|01 ! they are fighting|_|02 off poaching|_|01 and that sort|_|01 of stuff|_|05 . which is great|_|03 ! but i had no idea|_|03 that the elephants|_|02 are destroying|_|04 a lot|_|05 around|_|01 the . they have even|_|03 killed|_|01 people|_|03 ! sad|_|02 huh ? also|_|02 elephants|_|02 will wipe|_|01 out a farmers|_|03 entire|_|04 plants|_|04 and food|_|03 ! that is really|_|01 bad|_|01 . they feel|_|05 like|_|02 their government|_|02 care|_|02 more about the animals|_|01 than the people|_|03 ! i think|_|02 they should provide|_|02 some fencing|_|01 . that is ridiculous|_|02 to let|_|01 people|_|03 suffer|_|03 all because they wo n't put|_|02 up some barriers|_|03 to block|_|03 the elephants|_|02 .
it 's too bad|_|01 that we are still|_|03 in the middle|_|04 east|_|05 . i wish|_|03 trump|_|02 would just pull|_|17 out of the middle|_|04 east|_|05 entirely|_|01 so our soldiers|_|02 will stop|_|01 being targets|_|04 for all the countries|_|01 that hate|_|01 us|_|01 . the longer|_|01 we are there the easier|_|05 we make|_|35 it for them to inflict|_|01 damage|_|01 to our troops|_|01 . it must|_|01 not be easy|_|05 for them to be there away|_|02 from their families|_|01 .
robert|_|01 vaughn passed|_|01 away|_|06 but i do n't really|_|01 have anything to say|_|07 about him . people|_|03 die|_|02 every|_|02 day|_|09 and he was in his|_|01 80s|_|01 . he was in some famous|_|01 movies|_|01 and seemed|_|04 dot|_|09 have lived|_|05 a full|_|03 and happy|_|01 life|_|05 . he was n't in anything i have ever|_|01 seen|_|03 and i never|_|01 heard|_|02 few him before . maybe|_|01 ill|_|03 check|_|10 out his|_|01 movies|_|01 someday|_|01 since he was famous|_|01 .
i hate|_|01 the conflict|_|06 that is happening|_|04 here . i feel|_|05 for the three|_|02 soldiers|_|02 that died|_|05 and their families|_|08 . i guess|_|02 i 'm too much|_|01 of a pacifist|_|01 but i really|_|01 wish|_|04 that people|_|03 could realize|_|02 that this level|_|07 of conflict|_|06 is a waste|_|01 of resources|_|03 and lives|_|06 . however|_|01 , i also|_|02 know|_|01 that this is n't how the world|_|01 works|_|01 .
i am thankful|_|01 that there are people|_|03 who care|_|01 about this issue|_|02 , but i really|_|01 do n't . i feel|_|05 like|_|02 this is just part|_|01 of the life|_|01 - cycle|_|01 and i do n't really|_|01 get|_|01 why so much|_|01 money|_|03 is being wasted|_|03 on a problem|_|01 and is n't necessarily|_|03 crucial|_|01 . however|_|02 , as i said|_|01 , it 's probably|_|01 good|_|13 that people|_|03 who know|_|05 more about this issue|_|02 than i do are caring|_|01 about the problem|_|01 .
i have a real|_|02 hard|_|01 time|_|06 with this article|_|04 . my husband|_|01 is a us|_|01 army|_|01 soldier|_|01 that fought|_|03 to take|_|01 over mosul|_|01 the first|_|05 time|_|06 at the cost|_|03 of many|_|01 lives|_|02 . and through incompetent|_|01 measures|_|01 in our government|_|02 and military|_|02 , we let|_|01 go|_|01 of mosul|_|01 and are again trying|_|01 to figure|_|02 out a way|_|05 to take|_|01 it back|_|04 . it makes|_|08 me sad|_|02 that there are people|_|01 being oppressed|_|01 in the world|_|01 but it is also|_|02 clear|_|09 to me that at what cost|_|03 do we fight|_|03 the oppressors|_|01 and pick|_|01 a whose side|_|07 to be on . maybe|_|01 we should worry|_|06 about ourselves stateside and stay|_|03 out of the mess|_|02 in the middle|_|04 east|_|05 .
i 've seen|_|11 the lager|_|02 video|_|01 , he needs|_|01 to be in prison|_|02 . as far|_|05 as tensing|_|01 goes|_|03 , that 's a tough|_|01 call|_|12 . moral|_|01 of the story|_|03 is , do n't give|_|01 a man|_|01 with a gun|_|01 any reason|_|03 to be afraid|_|03 of you . the traffic|_|03 stop|_|04 went|_|03 the direction|_|01 it did because of du bose|_|01 's actions|_|01 . i have a hard|_|01 time|_|04 feeling|_|05 sympathy|_|02 for someone|_|01 who makes|_|02 horrible|_|03 decisions|_|04 that result|_|03 in predictable|_|01 outcomes|_|03 .
oh|_|01 my god|_|01 . did you hear|_|02 about this story|_|03 of this family|_|02 of two|_|01 girls|_|01 that got|_|03 killed|_|01 on halloween|_|01 ? apparently|_|01 they were hit|_|01 in a trailer|_|04 and that cause|_|02 them to die|_|04 . could you imagine|_|02 just wanting|_|05 to go|_|01 out and have fun|_|02 while trick|_|03 and treating|_|03 but then you get|_|03 the sad|_|02 news|_|02 that you daughters|_|01 are dead|_|01 ? this is heartbreaking|_|02 for that family|_|02 .
can you believe|_|01 this article|_|04 ? the more i read|_|03 this article|_|04 the more disgusted|_|02 i got|_|02 with what had been done to this kitten|_|01 . this is a awful|_|01 story|_|03 that deserves|_|01 to be heard|_|02 by more people|_|01 to make|_|02 sure|_|06 that the the kitten|_|01 receives|_|01 justice|_|02 , and that the person|_|01 who did this is not allowed|_|01 to hurt|_|02 any more animals|_|01 . i think|_|03 it is a great|_|01 thing|_|09 that this person|_|01 is not allowing|_|01 for someone|_|01 to get|_|02 away|_|01 with this and making|_|02 sure|_|06 that others will stand|_|03 with him and not allow|_|01 this crime|_|02 to go|_|02 unpunished|_|01 . i think|_|03 it would be great|_|01 if you could share|_|02 this story|_|03 and let|_|02 others know|_|11 so something like|_|02 this can be stopped|_|01 in the future|_|03 .
sleep|_|01 is very important|_|01 , and i ’m quite|_|04 sure|_|07 you know|_|01 that already|_|01 . however|_|01 , some aspects|_|01 of life|_|01 – like|_|02 habits|_|02 , even|_|03 smartphone , and stress|_|05 in work|_|05 – affect|_|01 our sleep|_|01 cycles|_|01 . a cdc|_|01 - backed|_|01 study|_|10 published|_|03 in february|_|01 of this year|_|03 has found|_|02 that about a third|_|01 of americans|_|03 earn’t getting|_|02 enough|_|01 sleep|_|01 . multiple|_|01 factors|_|01 affect|_|01 the country|_|04 ’s snooze|_|04 patterns|_|05 , and one|_|01 of which is routine|_|01 . many|_|01 people|_|03 , researchers|_|01 at the cdc|_|01 say|_|01 , are not prioritizing|_|01 sleep|_|01 . so how can you force|_|02 yourself to go|_|03 early|_|02 in bed|_|03 ? well|_|04 , this new|_|05 research|_|01 that we ’ll discuss|_|02 might|_|01 convince|_|09 you to review|_|05 your priorities|_|02 and put|_|07 sleep|_|01 above many|_|01 , because you still|_|01 can .
this is such a non|_|01 - story|_|02 . every|_|02 day|_|09 people|_|03 are dealing|_|01 with divorce|_|01 and custody|_|01 issues|_|02 . this unfortunately|_|01 has become|_|01 a common|_|06 problem|_|01 . generally|_|02 speaking|_|02 a story|_|02 like|_|02 this is sad|_|02 to read|_|10 or hear|_|02 about but these are celebrities|_|01 . who cares|_|02 about their problems|_|01 ? they are no more special|_|02 than anyone else|_|03 . people|_|03 who get|_|01 caught|_|21 up in celebrity|_|01 custody|_|01 battles|_|01 need|_|02 to get|_|01 a life|_|01 .
this was a terrible|_|01 tragedy|_|01 gone|_|01 wrong|_|01 , and honestly|_|02 i do n't really|_|01 know|_|01 if there was something that could be done about this before the event|_|01 even|_|01 happened|_|02 ? how did this man|_|10 get|_|01 into the airport|_|01 with a gun|_|02 ? was it because he did not pass|_|01 through security|_|02 before shooting|_|01 this man|_|10 or because he chose|_|01 not to ? i do n't think|_|01 something like|_|02 this should have happens|_|02 and being an airport|_|01 i definitely|_|01 do n't think|_|01 this should have happened|_|02 at all assuming|_|09 all the security|_|02 that they do have in place|_|01 how was this to happen|_|02 ?
i read|_|06 this article|_|04 about what black|_|02 people|_|03 think|_|02 . it is crazy|_|03 that they still|_|01 believe|_|01 they are being targeted|_|01 by the police|_|01 . can you believe|_|01 in this day|_|09 and age|_|01 they still|_|01 believe|_|01 that . the difference|_|03 between why more black|_|02 people|_|03 get|_|02 shot|_|17 is more of them do crimes|_|02 . add|_|01 to the fact|_|03 that black|_|02 families|_|04 tell|_|01 their kids|_|02 not to trust|_|03 the police|_|01 . do n't run|_|11 , do n't fight|_|02 back|_|05 and do what the police|_|01 officer|_|01 says|_|01 and you have a lot|_|07 great|_|03 chance|_|01 of not getting|_|02 shot|_|09 . i ca|_|01 n't stand|_|03 these black|_|02 people|_|03 who feel|_|05 like|_|02 they have it so bad|_|01 here . let|_|01 them try|_|01 living|_|01 back|_|05 in africa|_|01 and see|_|05 how they like|_|04 that .
an article|_|02 talking|_|05 about increasing|_|02 the deportations|_|03 of haitians|_|01 is one|_|05 that i feel|_|13 for those involved|_|01 . haiti|_|01 has been brutalized|_|03 by mother|_|05 nature|_|04 , and the clinton|_|04 , and people|_|01 are trying|_|01 to get|_|02 somewhere|_|01 to survive|_|02 while the country|_|04 recovers|_|04 . the u.s.|_|01 let|_|02 's them in to ship|_|04 them back|_|06 out and that is a bit|_|04 ridiculous|_|02 . it 's not a situation|_|01 where those from mexico|_|01 just sneak|_|02 over and hide|_|02 from society|_|02 . these people|_|01 need|_|03 help|_|01 but it does n't shock|_|01 me that the u.s.|_|01 would do this in a time|_|06 of need|_|02 . sympathy|_|03 felt|_|03 but helpless|_|02 to do anything about it .
i ca|_|01 n't believe|_|01 people|_|01 spend|_|03 their money|_|03 doing that kind|_|01 of parties|_|02 . i think|_|02 its not correct|_|01 to be extremist|_|01 in how much|_|01 we support|_|01 a president|_|01 . white|_|08 supremacists|_|01 are dangerous|_|01 people|_|01 with crazy|_|05 ideology|_|01 . they promote|_|01 horrible|_|03 values|_|06 to their sons|_|02 and to the society|_|01 , they are not respectful|_|02 with other races|_|03 and that hurt|_|06 the society|_|01 , specially|_|01 here in united|_|05 states|_|04 that is a mulch|_|01 - cultural|_|02 country|_|04 . this groups|_|01 should disappear|_|04 from the map|_|01 as soon|_|01 as possible|_|01 ! their ideology|_|01 is useless|_|01 in a country|_|04 like|_|02 this .
for all the married|_|02 couples|_|05 out there , please|_|03 think|_|10 twice|_|01 before you cheat|_|01 on your beloved|_|01 spouse|_|01 . is it really|_|01 worth|_|02 to throw|_|07 away|_|02 years|_|03 of experiences|_|03 down the drain|_|03 just to have fun|_|02 with a random|_|01 stranger|_|02 for a night|_|07 ? these celebrity|_|01 scandals|_|02 are such a joke|_|01 , all the times|_|06 i look|_|02 on the news|_|01 and these relationships|_|03 barely|_|01 last|_|05 .
being interested|_|01 in sports|_|05 and health|_|02 together|_|01 , this is a solid|_|15 article|_|04 showing|_|01 the impact|_|02 eye|_|03 injuries|_|02 have on different|_|01 types|_|05 of sports|_|05 . it 's somewhat|_|01 common|_|09 to see|_|03 these injuries|_|02 present|_|01 themselves in basketball|_|02 , baseball|_|02 , and sports|_|05 without protective|_|02 gear|_|04 . that 's just the nature|_|05 of sports|_|05 where consequences|_|01 happen|_|03 .
" i just read|_|10 an article|_|04 blaming|_|03 donald trump|_|02 and his|_|01 campaign|_|01 for hate|_|01 crimes|_|02 against muslims|_|01 rising|_|02 . it was your typical|_|03 propaganda|_|01 that the media|_|05 pushes|_|01 on you - you know|_|01 , fear|_|01 mongering|_|01 mixed|_|01 with unsubstantiated|_|01 nonsense|_|01 . it mentioned|_|01 the supposed|_|02 " " muslim|_|01 ban|_|02 " " that trump|_|02 was responsible|_|02 for . at that point|_|23 , i lost|_|01 interest|_|01 in the article|_|04 as it was 100|_|01 % clear|_|01 what the agenda|_|02 was . "
" did you hear|_|02 about the taliban|_|01 attack|_|05 on the german|_|01 consulate|_|01 in afghanistan|_|01 ? if not , they set|_|12 off a bomb|_|05 at the gates|_|04 and then an attack|_|05 ensued|_|01 . about 130|_|01 people|_|01 were injured|_|01 with 6|_|01 or so dead|_|01 . will that war|_|04 ever|_|03 end|_|01 ? an ancient|_|02 saying|_|01 says|_|01 that " " all empires|_|02 end|_|01 in that area|_|01 " " going|_|01 back|_|04 to alexander|_|02 the great|_|01 . the country|_|01 has never|_|02 known|_|05 peace|_|01 and it 's not looking|_|02 any better|_|01 . i feel|_|12 sorry|_|01 for all the injured|_|01 , especially|_|01 the children|_|01 . i 'm not sure|_|07 the un|_|01 is making|_|35 things|_|11 any better|_|01 either|_|01 ... "
i remember|_|01 this going|_|03 on . i knew|_|11 someone|_|01 who considered|_|05 this option|_|02 . it 's a shame|_|02 that women|_|01 have to think|_|01 like|_|02 this , about birth|_|05 control|_|02 meant|_|01 to outlast|_|01 a political|_|03 regime|_|01 . trump|_|01 and pence|_|02 are reprehensible|_|01 , but at least|_|01 it has n't come|_|04 to pass|_|01 - not that they would n't salivate|_|02 at the opportunity|_|01 to attack|_|01 omen|_|01 's health|_|02 like|_|02 this , we 've just been lucky|_|01 so far|_|03 that they have n't got|_|01 their way|_|01 . it bothers|_|01 me how these guys|_|03 think|_|01 .
its sad|_|02 that now and moving|_|02 forward|_|02 in my lifetime|_|05 we will see|_|05 many|_|01 older|_|01 actors|_|02 and actresses|_|01 succumb|_|13 to death|_|04 in its many|_|01 forms|_|01 . it makes|_|43 me feel|_|05 for those people|_|01 and gain|_|01 a sense|_|05 of time|_|03 in a view|_|03 that is not endless|_|04 . i can put|_|07 myself in the shoes|_|02 of someone|_|01 older|_|01 and battling|_|01 health|_|02 problems|_|01 and it saddens|_|01 me to do so .
it 's about time|_|02 somebody|_|01 stood|_|03 up to mexico|_|01 . we are being flooded|_|04 with mexicans|_|01 and immigrants|_|01 flooding|_|04 over the border|_|05 . it 's an invasion|_|03 as far|_|04 as i 'm concerned|_|01 . i could go|_|01 into detail|_|04 about all the negatives|_|02 it causes|_|02 . but what i am sick|_|01 of is every|_|02 time|_|02 we want|_|05 to do something about it , all the naysayers|_|01 and doomsayers through nafta|_|01 and trade|_|01 and economics|_|01 in our face|_|05 . i get|_|02 it we made|_|02 some dumb|_|04 deals|_|09 in the past|_|03 that have lead|_|05 to bad|_|01 consequences|_|01 , but we elected|_|02 trump|_|02 to take|_|29 a new|_|05 direction|_|01 . mexico|_|01 will have to get|_|02 their act|_|02 together|_|04 too , i 'm sick|_|01 of them acting|_|01 like|_|02 saints|_|02 every|_|02 time|_|02 we want|_|05 to take|_|29 an action|_|01 .
i ca|_|01 n't even|_|03 imagine|_|02 what it would be like|_|02 to be minding|_|01 our own business|_|01 in a club|_|06 and then having someone|_|01 come|_|02 in and shoot|_|02 you . this must|_|01 have been terrifying|_|01 for this person|_|01 . i certainly|_|01 hope|_|03 they did not lose|_|01 their life|_|08 and i also|_|02 hope|_|03 this is not an incident|_|02 that leads|_|03 to further problems|_|01 in the future|_|01 .
leonard|_|01 cohen just died|_|03 . knew|_|01 little|_|07 about him but now see|_|02 ill|_|01 have to look|_|09 into his|_|01 songs|_|01 and writing|_|10 . he was the epitome|_|01 of the starving|_|02 writer|_|02 , it seems|_|04 . his|_|01 popularity|_|01 continued|_|04 to grow|_|01 as he aged|_|01 , and he was able|_|04 to reap|_|02 some rewards|_|03 , but it did n't really|_|01 catch|_|03 up with his|_|01 needs|_|02 until recent|_|01 years|_|03 . he was a buddhist|_|01 monk|_|02 , too . had no idea|_|06 . he clearly|_|01 raised|_|02 the bar|_|07 in song|_|01 writing|_|10 .
hello|_|01 , i have just read|_|06 this article|_|04 and have to say|_|11 that it was a very good|_|18 and interesting|_|06 read|_|01 . it is about the chartered|_|01 institute|_|01 of environmental|_|02 health|_|02 and they discuss|_|02 how smoking|_|02 should be banned|_|02 in all parks|_|02 , zoos|_|02 , and playgrounds|_|02 to reduce|_|14 the chances|_|01 of children|_|04 growing|_|01 up thinking|_|01 that using|_|01 cigarettes|_|01 is normal|_|03 . i can see|_|17 why some might|_|01 say|_|11 that this is the last|_|01 step|_|01 before decriminalization|_|01 of the product|_|01 and consumer|_|01 .
" i do n't know|_|01 what more it 's gon na|_|01 take|_|29 for meat|_|01 eaters|_|01 to finally|_|01 get|_|01 it through their heads|_|01 that we consume|_|03 way|_|01 too much|_|01 meat|_|01 . if someone|_|01 says|_|01 " " plant|_|03 based|_|01 " " anywhere|_|01 near|_|01 them they seem|_|04 to automatically|_|01 reject|_|06 it . agriculture|_|01 is the main|_|03 contributor|_|03 to the destruction|_|01 of the earth|_|09 . it 's not like|_|02 people|_|01 are preaching|_|02 everyone go|_|03 vegan|_|01 , but drastically|_|01 reducing|_|20 your intake|_|01 of meat|_|01 would help|_|01 the planet|_|01 by a huge|_|01 margin|_|05 . for whatever|_|01 reason|_|06 , they just ca|_|01 n't seem|_|04 to rationalize|_|04 that simple|_|07 sentiment|_|01 . "
it is disturbing|_|11 that one|_|02 person|_|01 ’s views|_|08 ( such as president|_|01 of the usa|_|01 ) can be so disruptive|_|01 to people|_|01 ’s lives|_|01 . the situation|_|03 with the immigrants|_|01 from mexico|_|01 and the idea|_|03 of building|_|02 a southern|_|03 border|_|03 wall|_|04 is upsetting|_|02 to me . president|_|01 trump|_|02 policy|_|03 and views|_|08 are disruptive|_|01 to the whole|_|01 economy|_|04 of mexico|_|01 , causes|_|02 political|_|02 tension|_|06 and instability|_|04 , not to mention|_|01 the extreme|_|03 uncertainty|_|01 in the lives|_|11 of mexican|_|01 immigrants|_|01 in usa|_|01 , who already|_|01 have hard|_|01 lives|_|11 here .
i have no idea|_|03 what any of that means|_|01 but i wonder|_|02 sometimes|_|01 what it would be like|_|02 to play|_|16 a game|_|05 that goes|_|01 on over more than one|_|05 day|_|01 . imagine|_|02 if you could go|_|01 back|_|03 home|_|01 and go|_|01 to sleep|_|02 at halftime|_|01 of the super|_|02 bowl|_|07 and then come|_|02 back|_|03 the next|_|02 day|_|01 and play|_|16 the second|_|01 half|_|02 . maybe|_|01 then the falcons|_|01 would have taken|_|09 the 2nd|_|01 half|_|02 of that game|_|05 against the patriots|_|01 more seriously|_|01 . when i watched|_|01 lebanon|_|01 crush|_|01 the raptors|_|01 i was kind|_|01 of curious|_|02 as to how they slept|_|02 knowing|_|01 a game|_|05 was coming|_|02 up . they probably|_|01 felt|_|03 scared|_|10 , like|_|02 they had a big|_|01 test|_|02 coming|_|02 up and they did n't think|_|05 they were prepared|_|05 .
thinking|_|01 of the earthquakes|_|02 , makes|_|45 me think|_|05 of the issue|_|01 on global|_|01 warming|_|02 and climate|_|02 change|_|01 . it seems|_|02 like|_|02 we are having more and more natural|_|04 disasters|_|01 . this leads|_|23 you to think|_|05 of the cause|_|02 and how climate|_|02 change|_|01 had to be happening|_|03 . i could not imagine|_|01 . shows|_|01 you to be grateful|_|01 , you never|_|02 know|_|02 what could happen|_|03 . something are just out of your control|_|02 .
we need|_|02 to be more responsible|_|02 with our wilderness|_|03 areas|_|01 ! it is alarming|_|02 that no one|_|01 wants|_|05 to talk|_|02 about how these areas|_|01 are being destroyed|_|04 by development|_|01 and can never|_|02 be returned|_|01 to their original|_|04 wilderness|_|03 states|_|01 . can you imagine|_|02 a world|_|01 in which our children|_|04 can never|_|02 go|_|01 camping|_|01 or hiking|_|02 in the wilderness|_|03 because it has all been destroyed|_|04 and turned|_|10 into buildings|_|07 ? ?
you know|_|10 i have no sympathy|_|03 for anyone who harms|_|01 an animal|_|01 . i 'm a huge|_|01 animal|_|01 rights|_|01 advocate|_|02 and i think|_|01 those who are cruel|_|01 to animals|_|01 deserve|_|01 very strict|_|03 punishment|_|01 . the officer|_|04 involved|_|01 should be charged|_|03 with a crime|_|02 and fired|_|01 from their job|_|04 . i hate|_|01 it when people|_|01 hurt|_|02 defenseless|_|01 animals|_|01 and this particular|_|01 crime|_|02 did not have to happen|_|02 ! when this happens|_|02 with children|_|04 being left|_|12 in hot|_|20 cars|_|04 , there are serious|_|02 charges|_|03 leveled|_|01 and so , there should be the same in this case|_|02 !
it brings|_|04 me great|_|13 sorrow|_|02 to tell|_|03 you about a horrific|_|01 incident|_|01 that left|_|12 two|_|01 children|_|02 without parents|_|01 after a mechanical|_|03 failure|_|02 at an amusement|_|01 park|_|01 . it is truly|_|01 shocking|_|01 and disturbing|_|11 that this could have happened|_|03 . thee two|_|01 kids|_|02 slot|_|01 both parents|_|01 and they watched|_|06 them drown|_|03 which is disturbing|_|11 to think|_|13 about .
i think|_|02 that people|_|03 try|_|01 to pin|_|04 a lot|_|05 of stuff|_|05 on trump|_|02 as far|_|05 as sexism|_|01 goes|_|03 , but it does n't really|_|01 matter|_|02 . if people|_|03 want|_|05 trump|_|02 out of office|_|06 then they need|_|02 to find|_|02 something else|_|03 to pin|_|04 on him . he tampered|_|01 with the election|_|02 via the russians|_|02 , and thatch|_|01 what people|_|03 need|_|02 to pin|_|04 on him . this sexism|_|01 nonsense|_|01 is n't going|_|03 to go|_|03 anywhere|_|01
a reward|_|04 of $ 25000 is being offered|_|02 to catch|_|20 somebody|_|01 who is killing|_|01 horses|_|01 in the salt|_|01 river|_|01 area|_|02 . there are several|_|01 murders|_|01 of horses|_|01 every|_|01 year|_|03 . anyways|_|01 , the group|_|03 raising|_|04 the money|_|03 started|_|07 a campaign|_|01 on groundsmen|_|01 , and people|_|01 have donated|_|01 $ 25000 . the group|_|03 also|_|02 is concerned|_|02 with conservation|_|03 - related|_|02 issues|_|02 .
i ca|_|01 n't begin|_|09 to imagine|_|02 going|_|01 through that night|_|01 . the recollection|_|01 from the survivor|_|02 is horrifying|_|02 . i can not fathom|_|02 the thoughts|_|03 and emotions|_|01 of those who were there trapped|_|04 for hours|_|04 . the loss|_|02 of so many|_|01 makes|_|01 it easier|_|12 to become|_|04 desensitized|_|02 to it , but hearing|_|02 the individual|_|01 stories|_|03 makes|_|01 it so real|_|02 and sad|_|02 .
really|_|01 ? how are these people|_|01 allowed|_|01 to have children|_|02 ? its really|_|01 not that hard|_|07 to not poison|_|05 your child|_|02 is it ? i mean|_|04 it should n't be , but maybe|_|01 these people|_|01 are high|_|07 on their own drugs|_|01 so they do n't notice|_|01 their kids|_|02 are getting|_|01 into them . its really|_|01 sad|_|02 and something should certainly|_|01 be done .
another|_|01 case|_|01 of government|_|02 not working|_|03 like|_|02 it should . one|_|06 should have effective|_|05 recourse|_|02 without having to hire|_|01 an attorney|_|01 and spend|_|03 thousands|_|01 of dollars|_|03 to straighten|_|01 things|_|08 out . it makes|_|43 me angry|_|02 because i know|_|05 how easily|_|03 it could happen|_|02 to me . why people|_|03 ca|_|01 n't do their jobs|_|02 and/or show|_|04 some empathy|_|01 in this situation|_|01 is beyond|_|03 my comprehension|_|02 . i sure|_|07 hope|_|06 this does not happen|_|02 to me or you .
it 's always|_|01 a bad|_|09 thing|_|12 when the murder|_|01 rate|_|04 increases|_|03 . the fact|_|03 that it had the highest|_|01 increase|_|03 in decades|_|01 is incredibly|_|01 disturbing|_|11 , although it 's important|_|05 to remember|_|01 that the overall|_|02 rate|_|04 is still|_|01 much|_|01 lower|_|01 than it has been in the past|_|02 . people|_|03 think|_|01 that things|_|12 are more dangerous|_|02 than ever|_|01 today|_|02 , but the facts|_|03 show|_|02 that 's not true|_|08 .
i ca|_|01 n't really|_|01 believe|_|04 he was found|_|05 dead|_|01 in lo ' stromboli 's condo|_|01 . he was n't anywhere|_|01 near|_|01 old|_|01 enough|_|01 to die|_|11 of natural|_|09 causes|_|01 so it should be at least|_|01 a little|_|02 surprising|_|01 when we hear|_|02 about what the cause|_|01 of death|_|04 was . i am intrigued|_|01 to find|_|05 out if we have another|_|01 hollywood|_|02 murder|_|01 on our hands|_|12 . you just ca|_|01 n't tell|_|02 anymore|_|01 these days|_|10 . you never|_|01 know|_|10 who , you never|_|01 know|_|10 when .
people|_|03 who take|_|08 advantage|_|03 of and endanger|_|02 animals|_|01 are the worst|_|01 criminals|_|01 in existence|_|01 . animals|_|01 are defenseless|_|02 and unable|_|02 to do anything other than be confined|_|03 and taken|_|08 advantage|_|03 of . this article|_|04 shows|_|01 the unfortunate|_|03 process|_|05 after animals|_|01 are confiscated|_|01 and taken|_|08 away|_|09 from these dangerous|_|01 people|_|03 , but there is no global|_|01 consensus|_|01 on the proper|_|04 sequence|_|03 and handling|_|01 of these animals|_|01 .
hey ax|_|01 , i thought|_|03 this was a interesting|_|01 article|_|04 that you might|_|01 be interested|_|01 in reading|_|06 . it definitely|_|01 piqued|_|01 my interest|_|01 . i thought|_|03 it relates|_|05 to your situation|_|03 that you are dealing|_|04 with at the moment|_|06 . let|_|02 me know|_|05 what you think|_|03 of the video|_|01 as well|_|04 . i might|_|01 show|_|12 this to jackie too and see|_|05 if what she thinks|_|03 of it .
i feel|_|05 like|_|02 a lot|_|07 of artists|_|01 do this or try|_|01 to do this . take|_|06 credit|_|08 for music|_|05 or lyrics|_|01 that others have helped|_|05 with . this probably|_|01 happened|_|01 more then we know|_|01 about . they just made|_|36 an entire|_|02 disney|_|01 movie|_|01 on it . coco|_|03 . it basically|_|01 was about 2|_|01 singers|_|03 and the one|_|06 killed|_|01 the other so no one|_|02 would know|_|01 he made|_|36 and wrote|_|02 all the lyrics|_|01 and music|_|05 that the one|_|06 guy|_|03 stole|_|01 . i mean|_|03 any way|_|06 you look|_|02 at it it 's not right|_|03 . the guy|_|03 does serve|_|07 and pay|_|10 out and then some for what he has done to his|_|01 friend|_|01 .
what are we going|_|09 to do , start|_|10 collecting|_|02 cow|_|01 farts|_|01 ? that sounds|_|04 like|_|02 a good|_|20 job|_|02 to me . i bet|_|08 the benefits|_|02 are good|_|20 . i guess|_|02 the liberals|_|02 will try|_|01 to blame|_|03 meat|_|01 eaters|_|02 for this some how . i mean|_|04 , maybe|_|01 we can develop|_|15 some kind|_|01 of methane|_|01 collection|_|04 system|_|02 and then use|_|04 the cow|_|03 farts|_|01 to power|_|01 the world|_|08 . talk|_|03 about renewable|_|02 energy|_|06 !
i 'm not a fan|_|01 of muslim|_|01 migrants|_|01 myself . i find|_|05 most of arab|_|02 culture|_|02 backwards|_|02 and antithetical|_|01 to american|_|01 values|_|03 . this is pretty|_|01 fucked|_|01 up , though|_|01 . this article|_|04 feels|_|05 like|_|04 something out of the 1960s|_|01 . makes|_|01 you consider|_|05 the cyclical|_|04 and incremental|_|01 nature|_|01 of human|_|01 history|_|04 . despite|_|01 our technological|_|01 advances|_|03 we fall|_|03 prey|_|01 to the same prejudices|_|01 and biases|_|01 again and again . before we were burning|_|21 native|_|04 americans|_|03 , then the irish|_|02 , then blacks|_|01 , and now muslims|_|01 . human|_|02 progress|_|03 at work|_|01 .
this type|_|06 of thing|_|08 is always|_|04 largely|_|02 ignored|_|04 as it goes|_|01 on , when people|_|03 could have known|_|04 about it but chose|_|01 not to . then many|_|01 years|_|03 later|_|01 the truth|_|03 comes|_|04 out and some people|_|03 address|_|09 it with discomfort|_|02 , and others still|_|04 continue|_|02 to ignore|_|04 it . the way|_|01 for real|_|03 change|_|01 to come|_|04 is with accountability|_|01 . any crimes|_|02 that are n't protected|_|01 by a statue|_|01 of limitations|_|04 need|_|03 to be addressed|_|09 through prosecution|_|02 , and they need|_|03 to look|_|02 for ways|_|01 to prosecute|_|01 instead|_|01 of looking|_|02 for ways|_|01 not to . they should also|_|02 encourage|_|03 civil|_|02 suits|_|01 , but those are always|_|04 against the departments|_|03 and not the individuals|_|01 . there needs|_|03 to be reform|_|02 so that the officers|_|01 are the ones|_|01 that are held|_|01 accountable|_|01 instead|_|01 of the taxpayers|_|01 continually|_|01 having to make|_|08 payouts because the police|_|01 broke|_|02 the law|_|01 .
i just read|_|03 an article|_|02 about suicide|_|02 , it was really|_|01 sad|_|02 . it started|_|07 off talking|_|02 about a 12|_|01 year|_|03 old|_|07 girl|_|01 who was interested|_|01 in suicide|_|02 groups|_|01 online|_|03 . one|_|01 day|_|05 she went|_|04 to school|_|07 , or so her mother|_|05 thought|_|03 . the mother|_|05 received|_|03 a phone|_|01 call|_|01 from the channel|_|07 a&e notifying|_|02 her that her daughter|_|01 had took|_|01 her own life|_|07 . the article|_|02 went|_|04 on to say|_|01 how russia|_|01 was third|_|01 in the world|_|01 in suicides|_|02 . it was a really|_|01 sad|_|02 article|_|02 .
talking|_|02 about donald trump|_|02 is so depressing|_|04 at this point|_|01 . i wish|_|04 that article|_|04 had a little|_|01 more about climate|_|02 change|_|06 in it , which seems|_|04 to be the current|_|01 biggest|_|01 actual|_|05 crisis|_|02 of his|_|01 presidency|_|02 , but for some reason|_|06 ( horrifyingly|_|01 ) that topic|_|01 divides|_|01 people|_|03 . i want|_|04 to hear|_|02 from people|_|03 who have voted|_|05 for him and who 's minds|_|01 have changed|_|02 .
i think|_|02 the wraparound|_|01 glasses|_|01 are a great|_|01 idea|_|03 . i do n't care|_|02 how ridiculous|_|03 they look|_|09 . if i had to choose|_|03 whether or not my kid|_|01 was worried|_|02 about fashion|_|01 or protecting|_|02 his|_|01 eyes|_|05 , eye|_|05 protection|_|01 would win|_|01 every|_|01 time|_|03 . ugh , can you imagine|_|02 the possibility|_|01 of losing|_|05 your eyesight|_|01 , or possibly|_|02 even|_|03 the whole|_|02 eye|_|05 , just because you did n't want|_|03 to look|_|09 silly|_|01 ? nope , wraparound|_|01 glasses|_|01 all the way|_|01 !
this is just disgusting|_|02 . i can not believe|_|01 that this is happening|_|03 to people|_|01 . why are people|_|01 afraid|_|02 to go|_|03 to the doctor|_|01 ? there is no reason|_|06 for this . i am numb|_|03 to all this madness|_|01 and i can not believe|_|01 i am writing|_|10 about a man|_|08 's penis|_|01 right|_|07 now . i can not find|_|05 any excuse|_|02 for this and people|_|01 need|_|02 to be educated|_|01 about the health|_|02 care|_|06 system|_|02 so they are not so afraid|_|02 of it .
i thank|_|01 god|_|01 because my sisters|_|05 were born|_|10 in usa|_|01 instead|_|01 of those countries|_|01 in the middle|_|04 east|_|05 who still|_|03 believe|_|01 in male|_|03 guardianship|_|02 . can you imagine|_|02 a woman|_|02 seeking|_|01 permission|_|01 fro a male|_|03 figure|_|01 who is a relative|_|01 and sometimes|_|01 a son|_|02 to acquire|_|01 a passport?that is so bad|_|09 . i hope|_|02 the activists|_|01 will succeed|_|02 in helping|_|06 this women|_|02 because this is so outrageous|_|01 .
you can never|_|02 really|_|01 trust|_|03 a person|_|01 . someone|_|01 can end|_|04 up dead|_|02 and those who are left|_|06 in the wake|_|01 are the ones|_|02 that suffer|_|11 . really|_|01 makes|_|03 you think|_|03 just how short|_|09 of a life|_|08 we have in comparison|_|01 . but having no sex|_|03 can do something to a person|_|01 . it is one|_|02 of those things|_|04 that we have a bond|_|01 between a person|_|01 and if something in a relationship|_|01 is not working|_|02 it can drive|_|07 a person|_|01 to do something they would normally|_|01 not do .
hello|_|01 friend|_|01 . how are you ? how is your family|_|01 ? we had some time|_|06 without contact|_|08 , we should avoid|_|02 that and always|_|04 communicate|_|05 . of sure|_|06 where you live|_|01 this that i am going|_|01 to say|_|07 to you is already|_|01 news|_|02 but , friend|_|01 , you must|_|01 take|_|01 care|_|03 of you and your family|_|01 please|_|02 . i do not know|_|01 if you found|_|10 out but i read|_|03 in a digital|_|03 online|_|03 newspaper|_|01 samples|_|01 of violence|_|01 in philadelphia|_|01 , i could not get|_|01 out of my head|_|01 that you live|_|01 in that place|_|01 . apparently|_|01 a person|_|01 who was armed|_|02 shot|_|01 in the stomach|_|04 to an elderly|_|01 man|_|08 and another|_|01 person|_|01 who was accompanying|_|02 him . one|_|05 of the reports|_|03 i 've heard|_|02 from the police|_|01 is that the crime|_|02 weapon|_|02 has not been found|_|10 , which makes|_|27 me suppose|_|02 that until now the police|_|01 have no idea|_|01 who was , and neither|_|01 the clues|_|02 to catch|_|19 the bad|_|01 guy|_|01 . the police|_|01 do not know|_|01 anything so it means|_|01 t
hey buddy|_|01 . i think|_|09 this article|_|04 made|_|27 me worried|_|01 about this erika situation|_|01 . it is spreading|_|09 with such vigor|_|02 like|_|02 never|_|01 before and it kills|_|01 very fast|_|01 . i think|_|09 the whole|_|01 world|_|01 needs|_|01 to be on alert|_|03 and health|_|01 scientists|_|01 need|_|01 to be working|_|02 hard|_|01 to try|_|01 and eradicate|_|03 this disease|_|01 . it 's gon na|_|01 take|_|01 some time|_|02 but something needs|_|02 to be done
the article|_|04 was quite|_|02 eye|_|05 opening|_|03 for someone|_|01 who may|_|01 not be extremely|_|01 into politics|_|05 . the confederate|_|02 flag|_|08 seems|_|02 to somehow|_|02 have different|_|01 meanings|_|01 to different|_|01 people|_|01 , which i never|_|02 really|_|01 understood|_|01 . to get|_|02 upset|_|01 because the flag|_|08 was being hung|_|15 in college|_|03 campuses|_|01 , makes|_|02 sense|_|02 to me . i would get|_|02 upset|_|02 as well|_|07 . for students|_|01 to be afraid|_|03 for their welfare|_|01 and or they education|_|04 at their college|_|03 because of president|_|02 elect|_|02 trump|_|02 , also|_|02 makes|_|02 sense|_|02 to me . the whole|_|01 campaign|_|01 seems|_|02 to be one|_|06 big|_|05 controversy|_|01 .
i felt|_|03 very bad|_|01 when read|_|03 these kinds|_|01 of news|_|04 . for me , it is vital|_|01 to protect|_|02 women|_|01 and kids|_|01 . i think|_|01 they are vulnerable|_|03 than men|_|01 . the society|_|02 should give|_|43 more protect|_|02 to them . i really|_|01 feel|_|13 pity|_|02 for the girls|_|02 who had suffering|_|11 like|_|02 that . i hate|_|01 those bad|_|01 people|_|01 that did all these crimes|_|02 . they should be punished|_|01 .
ugh , i just read|_|05 an article|_|04 about our disgusting|_|02 president|_|02 and the way|_|02 women|_|02 are reacting|_|03 to these rumors|_|01 , allegations|_|02 and truths|_|05 made|_|01 about this man|_|08 and his|_|01 inexcusable|_|02 treatment|_|01 of women|_|02 in the past|_|02 . and , that 's just it , who is stupid|_|01 enough|_|01 to think|_|12 his|_|01 behavior|_|01 is only in the past|_|01 and is not still|_|04 occurring|_|02 today|_|01 behind|_|01 closed|_|01 doors|_|04 ! ? i am sure|_|07 it is only a matter|_|02 of time|_|05 before that also|_|02 comes|_|04 out . the more and more i read|_|05 about him , the more and more disturbed|_|01 i am to have him as a president|_|02 and wish|_|03 i did not live|_|01 in a country|_|04 where that animal|_|01 is calling|_|01 the shots|_|14 . the article|_|04 was talking|_|02 about women|_|02 , especially|_|01 republican|_|02 women|_|02 , starting|_|02 to pull|_|17 away|_|02 from their candidate|_|02 and losing|_|07 their warm|_|02 and fuzzy|_|03 feelings|_|01 towards trump|_|01 . about time|_|05 !
i read|_|06 an article|_|03 about making|_|35 the ivory|_|01 trade|_|03 legal|_|05 , and it said|_|11 it could cause|_|02 the extinction|_|04 of elephants|_|02 . i find|_|01 it extremely|_|01 disturbing|_|11 , since i ca|_|01 n't imagine|_|02 elephants|_|02 being extinct|_|03 . it makes|_|35 me really|_|01 angry|_|03 that poachers|_|03 are able|_|02 to kill|_|14 so many|_|01 elephants|_|02 , and that even|_|01 if it 's legal|_|05 to trade|_|02 ivory|_|01 , the demand|_|01 is still|_|04 really|_|01 high|_|02 . i think|_|02 finding|_|01 a substitute|_|01 for ivory|_|01 is a better|_|17 choice|_|02 . no one|_|06 actually|_|02 needs|_|01 ivory|_|01 , and keeping|_|04 it illegal|_|01 seems|_|04 like|_|02 a better|_|17 idea|_|03 .
hi|_|01 there . i just read|_|03 an article|_|04 and i feel|_|05 like|_|02 i need|_|03 to share|_|02 my thoughts|_|01 on it . it was about an oil|_|01 spill|_|01 ! ! oil|_|01 spills|_|01 are so upsetting|_|04 . i feel|_|05 so sorry|_|01 for all the ocean|_|02 life|_|13 and animals|_|01 that are affected|_|01 and will be affected|_|01 ! it 's so tragic|_|01 . i wish|_|04 we could prevent|_|01 these from ever|_|03 happening|_|03 again .
although i do think|_|01 that companies|_|01 have the right|_|01 to advertise|_|02 their product|_|01 willingly|_|01 , i also|_|02 think|_|01 that targeting|_|01 kids|_|01 is wrong|_|05 . i think|_|01 that good|_|02 health|_|02 should come|_|21 first|_|01 and the advertisement|_|01 should condone|_|06 this . advertisements|_|01 should not target|_|01 kids|_|01 , given|_|05 that they do n't really|_|01 know|_|10 what is good|_|02 for them yet|_|04 .
a diseased|_|01 called|_|27 microscopically|_|02 has spread|_|02 from south|_|01 america|_|01 to america|_|01 . it 's a virus|_|03 which causes|_|02 severe|_|02 brain|_|01 impairment|_|02 . in the article|_|02 , a couple|_|01 's child|_|04 has the disease|_|01 and showed|_|10 signs|_|01 of impairment|_|02 early|_|06 on . they were worried|_|02 whether a second|_|01 child|_|04 would also|_|02 have the disease|_|01 but the child|_|04 did not even|_|04 though|_|01 the odds|_|02 were one|_|06 in four|_|01 .
wow|_|02 .. you have to check|_|23 this out . there was a horrible|_|03 accident|_|02 on a family|_|01 type|_|06 water|_|01 ride|_|08 in gold|_|01 coast|_|02 australia|_|02 . 4|_|01 people|_|01 were killed|_|01 .. 2|_|01 women|_|02 ages|_|01 42|_|01 and 32|_|01 i think|_|03 , also|_|02 two|_|01 men|_|01 , 38|_|01 , and 35|_|01 , . this is what happened|_|02 ... 2|_|01 people|_|01 were ejected|_|01 from the raft|_|01 and the other 2|_|01 were trapped|_|02 inside|_|01 .. they all died|_|04 . the park|_|02 was shut|_|02 down . the thing|_|09 that makes|_|18 it weird|_|01 is that the water|_|01 feature|_|01 is like|_|01 a tame|_|01 family|_|01 type|_|06 ride|_|08 .. definitely|_|01 things|_|09 families|_|01 would go|_|01 on together|_|03 . makes|_|01 you think|_|03 right|_|08 ?
i am a little|_|01 bit|_|05 on the fences|_|02 about how to approach|_|01 immigration|_|01 and the mexican|_|01 border|_|03 problem|_|01 . this article|_|04 talks|_|02 about different|_|01 issues|_|06 president|_|01 trump|_|02 has had his|_|01 hands|_|13 in on and how some problems|_|01 are arising|_|01 . i think|_|02 the countries|_|04 need|_|01 to stand|_|10 alone|_|02 and work|_|03 on their own issues|_|06 so they have home|_|02 build|_|01 strength|_|01 . seems|_|02 like|_|04 a lot|_|04 of compromising|_|03 is not taking|_|01 place|_|02 .
this is horrible|_|03 . too have a disaster|_|01 like|_|02 this happen|_|03 is sad|_|02 . other nations|_|04 should do what we can in order|_|02 to help|_|01 . you never|_|02 know|_|01 when we may|_|01 need|_|01 the help|_|01 for other countries|_|04 . we know|_|01 as a country|_|04 how hard|_|01 it is to loss|_|01 everything to a natural|_|06 disaster|_|01 . all the lives|_|13 lost|_|07 it is best|_|02 practice|_|05 to help|_|01 out .
the war|_|01 that involved|_|01 india|_|01 and pakistan|_|01 is terrible|_|02 . there are so many|_|01 innocent|_|07 civilian|_|01 me were killed|_|05 . the world|_|08 needs|_|01 peace|_|02 and it is hard|_|01 to imagine|_|02 that a lot|_|05 of people|_|03 in 21st|_|01 center|_|07 are still|_|04 suffering|_|11 from wars|_|01 . we should really|_|01 cherish|_|02 that we live|_|02 in the us|_|01 and far|_|04 from what happened|_|04 there .

while reading|_|06 this , i ca|_|01 n't help|_|01 but think|_|02 about how much|_|01 of politics|_|05 nowadays|_|01 is about money|_|01 . how many|_|01 millions|_|02 of dollars|_|02 is spent|_|03 trying|_|01 to convince|_|09 people|_|01 that someone|_|01 is a good|_|19 person|_|01 and right|_|02 for the job|_|02 . it should be like|_|02 any other position|_|01 . work|_|03 hard|_|01 . do good|_|19 . build|_|04 a resume|_|01 you can be proud|_|01 of and let|_|01 that speak|_|02 for itself !
this poor|_|02 family|_|01 lost|_|11 the father|_|01 just a short|_|02 time|_|03 ago|_|01 ! now she is sick|_|01 and suffering|_|03 . please|_|03 keep|_|04 this family|_|01 in your thoughts|_|03 and prayers|_|01 in the next|_|02 few days|_|01 as they treat|_|05 her . i hope|_|03 her family|_|01 is able|_|04 to be there with her during this hard|_|01 time|_|03 , and that they are able|_|04 to help|_|05 her in her recovery|_|03 .
did you hear|_|02 about this sexual|_|02 harassment|_|02 scandal|_|01 involving|_|01 the national|_|01 parks|_|06 service|_|01 ? i guess|_|02 there really|_|01 is no industry|_|02 that is immune|_|04 to this misbehavior|_|01 . incidents|_|02 have been documenting|_|02 going|_|03 back|_|03 decades|_|01 but nothing|_|01 was done about it . it 's really|_|01 outrageous|_|01 what people|_|03 in power|_|02 can get|_|04 away|_|01 with .
" these pellet|_|02 guns|_|01 almost|_|07 seem|_|04 like|_|02 they were meant|_|04 to maim|_|01 individuals|_|01 , under the guise|_|01 of a less|_|01 - lethal|_|02 round|_|11 . the fact|_|01 that the ammunition|_|02 seems|_|04 to have been modified|_|01 to cause|_|01 more damage|_|03 , more permanent|_|02 damage|_|03 , seems|_|04 to back|_|01 that up . it 's a travesty|_|01 that such violence|_|01 is being committed|_|18 , such life|_|08 changing|_|01 violence|_|01 . these people|_|01 are not dying|_|04 , they 're being irreparably|_|01 harmed|_|01 , altered|_|01 , changed|_|01 for the rest|_|06 of their lives|_|08 . more people|_|01 should be talking|_|03 about the use|_|07 of such " " non|_|01 - lethal|_|02 " " weapons|_|02 . ca|_|01 n't the local|_|03 force|_|05 exercise|_|01 some restraint|_|01 , some humanity|_|08 ? it 's confusing|_|05 , because i ca|_|01 n't think|_|13 of any reason|_|02 other than harm|_|01 someone|_|01 would introduce|_|01 maiming|_|01 pellets|_|02 as such as the case|_|09 here . "
hi|_|01 , i just read|_|06 an article|_|03 about a sue|_|01 concerning|_|02 an apartment|_|01 , and it got|_|02 me thinking|_|01 . why do people|_|03 never|_|02 do research|_|01 before signing|_|07 any papers|_|01 ? it really|_|01 is not that big|_|01 of a deal|_|09 or a difficult|_|02 thing|_|01 to do , this should be something basic|_|04 to do , you know|_|11 ? it just troubles|_|01 me how far|_|03 things|_|01 can go|_|03 just because people|_|03 do not really|_|01 read|_|06 !
i feel|_|05 like|_|02 our police|_|01 force|_|01 is getting|_|01 kinda|_|02 out of control|_|02 with its killings|_|02 recently|_|01 . it 's all i seem|_|02 to hear|_|02 about on the news|_|01 nowadays|_|01 . they recently|_|01 charged|_|03 an officer|_|01 who shot|_|03 an unarmed|_|01 black|_|05 driver|_|02 when he was outside|_|05 his|_|01 vehicle|_|03 . it 's like|_|02 the police|_|01 do n't even|_|01 care|_|02 anymore|_|01 which is really|_|01 scary|_|01 .
this is so sad|_|02 . something needs|_|02 to be done for these refugees|_|01 . people|_|01 need|_|03 to be more accepting|_|02 of them . people|_|01 should n't be afraid|_|02 of letting|_|01 them into their country|_|01 , they are just people|_|01 who need|_|03 help|_|01 . i feel|_|05 so bad|_|01 for the babies|_|04 , children|_|03 and mothers|_|01 on these boats|_|01 . it 's horrifying|_|02 to imagine|_|02 drowning|_|03 in the sea|_|03 , especially|_|01 from the eyes|_|05 of a child|_|03 .
hey , i just read|_|03 this insane|_|01 article|_|04 about the situation|_|03 in aleppo|_|01 . i did n't even|_|03 realize|_|02 how bad|_|01 it was . people|_|03 are dying|_|01 and have no hope|_|02 for the future|_|03 . it really|_|01 makes|_|43 me appreciate|_|02 everything i have in life|_|05 and the article|_|04 makes|_|43 all my problems|_|01 seem|_|02 so trivial|_|03 and insignificant|_|04 by comparison|_|01 . anyway|_|02 , you should check|_|10 it out .
i read|_|06 about this asshole|_|01 aryan|_|01 ce|_|01 tin|_|02 who shot|_|03 up a mall|_|02 in oak|_|02 harbor|_|02 , washington|_|05 . evidently|_|01 before he did the shooting|_|02 he had been placed|_|01 under a no firearm|_|01 order|_|11 because he had been charged|_|03 with domestic|_|05 assault|_|02 . i guess|_|02 it just goes|_|01 to show|_|02 that gun|_|02 laws|_|01 are a pointless|_|01 joke|_|01 ; if this guy|_|03 had been a decent|_|06 law|_|01 abiding|_|03 person|_|03 no gun|_|02 law|_|01 would be needed|_|02 , but because it was a criminal|_|03 and a murderer|_|01 the law|_|01 did n't do anything to stop|_|01 him from shooting|_|03 up a mall|_|02 .
hey i thought|_|03 you 'd be interested|_|01 in this article|_|04 i just read|_|09 about the complications|_|04 associated|_|01 with contact|_|09 lenses|_|01 . i know|_|11 you were considering|_|01 allowing|_|01 mary|_|01 to get|_|01 contacts|_|09 instead|_|01 of her glasses|_|01 this year|_|03 . it seems|_|04 that complications|_|04 can range|_|12 from microbial|_|01 infections|_|04 to complete|_|02 blindness|_|01 ! interestingly|_|01 , the cdc|_|01 notes|_|07 that there are less|_|01 incidents|_|01 with the disposable|_|02 lenses|_|01 . have you considered|_|01 them at all ?
we all live|_|05 in the same america|_|01 . i believe|_|01 that we all have the same hopes|_|06 , dreams|_|01 and goals|_|04 . i can understand|_|01 to some trump|_|02 represents|_|02 the return|_|10 of jobs|_|06 and other industry|_|02 , but to others he is a symbol|_|02 of hate|_|01 . i know|_|05 you voted|_|05 for him and i know|_|05 that you are not racist|_|02 , but can you see|_|17 how much|_|01 this has torn|_|05 the country|_|02 apart|_|03 ? we both know|_|05 that the country|_|02 was not already|_|01 united|_|03 as one|_|06 , but this has made|_|03 it worst|_|01 . i do not see|_|17 it getting|_|17 any better|_|01 anytime soon|_|01 . i hope|_|03 the country|_|02 can heel|_|04 and both sides|_|08 can work|_|01 it out .
we are living|_|02 in a world|_|03 that ha|_|02 problems|_|01 left|_|01 and right|_|02 and sometimes|_|01 i ca|_|01 n't help|_|01 but to be sad|_|02 because so many|_|01 people|_|01 and animals|_|01 are suffering|_|01 . rivers|_|01 are drying|_|02 in some places|_|01 and ll the fishes|_|02 are dying|_|11 while some areas|_|06 have flash|_|01 floods|_|01 that destroy|_|04 things|_|08 and kill|_|01 people|_|01 . this are end|_|10 times|_|02 and am saddened|_|02 all the time|_|02 by such issues|_|01 .
it is horrible|_|03 that things|_|09 like|_|01 this are still|_|01 happening|_|03 in the gulf|_|03 of mexico|_|01 and especially|_|01 since it is a priest|_|02 . the cartels|_|04 are doing horrible|_|03 things|_|09 that need|_|02 to be controlled|_|10 . it seems|_|02 like|_|01 the mexican|_|01 government|_|02 can not do anything about it . maybe|_|01 there are some members|_|04 in the government|_|02 creating|_|02 the problem|_|01
this will embolden|_|01 trump|_|02 supporters|_|01 stance|_|01 on immigration|_|02 reform|_|02 . i however|_|04 do not believe|_|01 just cause|_|02 you are muslim|_|01 or an immigrant|_|01 you are more prone|_|02 to committing|_|01 a terror|_|04 attack|_|05 . attacks|_|05 of terror|_|04 and mass|_|03 shooting|_|02 are mostly|_|01 causes|_|02 by angry|_|03 white|_|01 men|_|01 . when it 's a white|_|01 man|_|01 he s a lone|_|02 wolf|_|04 and when your from a foreign|_|02 country|_|02 its terrorism|_|01 . i am not making|_|08 excuses|_|02 for what happened|_|04 . surly|_|01 its tragic|_|01 but lets|_|02 not pool|_|02 a whole|_|01 race|_|03 of people|_|01 into a negative|_|03 basket|_|04 because of one|_|01 or two|_|01 bad|_|01 eggs|_|01 .
the article|_|04 that i just read|_|03 sheds|_|01 light|_|01 on how hard|_|07 it really|_|01 is for people|_|01 to get|_|02 out of timeshares . the article|_|04 highlighted|_|02 an older|_|07 couple|_|02 . the couple|_|02 bought|_|01 their timeshare when their children|_|02 were younger|_|01 and they were able|_|02 to travel|_|06 . now , many|_|01 years|_|03 later|_|01 , the older|_|07 couple|_|02 finds|_|03 it hard|_|07 it get|_|02 traveler|_|01 's insurance|_|01 . they also|_|02 stated|_|02 how expensive|_|01 traveling|_|01 can be alone|_|02 . the couple|_|02 is struggling|_|03 to get|_|02 rid|_|01 of their timeshare . it makes|_|02 me feel|_|05 for the couple|_|02 and other people|_|01 in this financial|_|01 burden|_|01 .
" here we go|_|03 again . another|_|01 news|_|01 report|_|02 of another|_|01 earthquake|_|02 in chile|_|02 . fortunately|_|01 this one|_|05 apparently|_|01 did n't cause|_|02 any damage|_|02 , but it was no slouch|_|01 either|_|01 at a magnitude|_|02 6.4 . had the earthquake|_|02 struck|_|04 in a little|_|01 different|_|03 location|_|01 , who know|_|01 what might|_|01 have happened|_|01 . this is the same place|_|01 that got|_|14 hit|_|01 with an 8.8 a couple|_|01 years|_|03 ago|_|01 . remember|_|01 that one|_|05 ? that was so sad|_|02 . it triggered|_|04 a tsunami|_|01 and 500|_|01 people|_|01 were killed|_|01 . not to mention|_|01 the fact|_|03 that there were 220,000 homes|_|01 lost|_|01 . one|_|05 piece|_|01 of good|_|01 news|_|01 at least|_|01 , since the 8.8 earthquake|_|02 , they have put|_|01 in a warning|_|03 system|_|05 for earthquakes|_|02 and tsunamis|_|01 . thank|_|01 god|_|03 for that . that certainly|_|01 ca|_|01 n't prevent|_|01 any earthquakes|_|02 from happening|_|01 , but at least|_|01 maybe|_|01 it will save|_|06 some lives|_|01 if , or should i say|_|01 " " when " " , the next|_|03 earthquake|_|02 occurs|_|01 . "
here is another|_|01 interesting|_|01 story|_|02 but this one|_|05 is about squirrels|_|02 and leprosy|_|01 . in the uk|_|01 they found|_|10 that red|_|01 squirrels|_|02 are getting|_|01 leprosy|_|01 and that never|_|01 happened|_|01 before . the article|_|02 also|_|02 mentions|_|01 that armadillos|_|01 get|_|01 leprosy|_|01 also|_|02 which i did n't know|_|11 . i always|_|04 thought|_|02 it was a disease|_|01 that only affected|_|01 humans|_|02 and mostly|_|01 in biblical|_|02 times|_|02 although i guess|_|02 it is not an issue|_|02 now just because we learned|_|02 how to top|_|10 it from spreading|_|02 .
thinking|_|09 about the refugee|_|01 situation|_|03 around|_|04 the globe|_|03 is so disheartening|_|01 . there are so many|_|01 people|_|01 who are only trying|_|01 to survive|_|02 who can not find|_|01 support|_|06 anywhere|_|01 . those of us|_|01 in countries|_|04 with resources|_|02 really|_|01 need|_|02 to start|_|03 pushing|_|08 out legislators|_|01 to accept|_|07 and support|_|03 these people|_|01 , especially|_|01 when their situations|_|03 are the result|_|02 of our own policies|_|03 . humans|_|02 need|_|02 to look|_|02 out for each other far|_|05 more -- we should value|_|04 every|_|02 life|_|02 the same , no matter|_|02 the country|_|04 of its origin|_|04 .
sometimes|_|01 i worry|_|06 a little|_|02 , when i 'm out in public|_|02 , about a mass|_|03 - shooting|_|02 ( or even|_|03 some crazy|_|01 with a vehicle|_|01 running|_|18 people|_|01 over ) happening|_|02 . but , on the other side|_|01 of the coin|_|01 , the chances|_|01 are pretty|_|02 slim|_|04 of that happening|_|02 . plus|_|01 , if you think|_|02 about it , the worst|_|01 thing|_|05 that happens|_|02 , if that were to occur|_|01 , is that i die|_|05 and then nothing|_|01 is my problem|_|01 anymore|_|01 . i 'm in no rush|_|07 to die|_|05 , but if it happens|_|02 , it happens|_|02 . it 's an inevitability|_|01 .
this is one|_|06 of those articles|_|02 that can really|_|01 make|_|42 you feel|_|13 paranoid|_|01 . like|_|04 , what if suddenly|_|01 there is a red|_|01 squirrel|_|02 in my backyard|_|01 and it has this sickness|_|01 ? and now i might|_|01 have it . you know|_|05 ? stuff|_|01 like|_|04 that . in the other hand|_|12 , it just shows|_|01 how little|_|03 we know|_|05 of these world|_|03 . of the illness|_|01 , the animals|_|01 , how it affects|_|01 us|_|01 . so much|_|01 to discover|_|02
trump|_|02 continues|_|01 to fuck|_|01 up the nation|_|04 . did you read|_|06 this story|_|03 of how trump|_|02 wants|_|05 to back|_|01 out of the paris|_|04 accord|_|01 ? as a nation|_|04 we are finally|_|01 trying|_|01 to seriously|_|01 address|_|01 climate|_|02 change|_|06 and we are doing that with partners|_|01 around|_|07 the world|_|01 . however|_|01 , trump|_|02 the national|_|06 embarrassment|_|01 has seen|_|01 to it that not only do we not continue|_|01 trying|_|01 to make|_|01 the planet|_|03 better|_|07 , but we also|_|02 betray|_|03 our allies|_|01 .
there was this article|_|04 about a subject|_|01 i no nothing|_|01 about and really|_|01 could care|_|01 less|_|02 but here i am messaging|_|03 you about it .................. hope|_|02 you find|_|02 this very very very very very very very very entertaining|_|01 ............. i know|_|01 i have , so what else|_|03 have you been up to ............. i hope|_|03 you find|_|02 this pleasant|_|02 to read|_|06 ......
so one|_|01 of maria|_|02 carey backup|_|01 dancers|_|02 got|_|01 fired|_|05 and banned|_|02 from the teasers|_|03 palace|_|04 . her ex|_|02 packer|_|01 got|_|01 super|_|02 jealous|_|02 of the flirting|_|02 between them and went|_|01 all crazy|_|01 on him . but i do not know|_|07 why he cares|_|02 since they broke|_|28 up last|_|02 month|_|01 after something went|_|01 on between him and her assistant|_|01 . they say|_|01 he did something bad|_|01 to her but i bet|_|08 he was trying|_|01 to flirt|_|01 with her as well|_|01 .
i do n't know|_|05 if you ever|_|01 owned or read|_|06 a copy|_|04 of national|_|01 geographic|_|02 magazine|_|01 but there is something interesting|_|01 that has occurred|_|02 in the news|_|01 lately|_|01 . it appears|_|05 that the little|_|08 afghan|_|01 girl|_|05 , who was made|_|03 famous|_|01 on one|_|06 of their covers|_|09 , was arrested|_|07 for trying|_|01 to cross|_|01 into pakistan|_|01 . she was trying|_|01 to enter|_|01 as an unregistered|_|03 immigrant|_|01 instead|_|01 of a refugee|_|01 . the pakistan|_|01 government|_|01 wants|_|02 to have her arrested|_|07 . i mean|_|04 after all , she 's just trying|_|01 to do what 's best|_|03 for herself by escaping|_|05 a land|_|04 that is overrun|_|04 with various|_|01 terrorist|_|01 groups|_|03 and warring|_|01 clans|_|02 . i 'm not sure|_|07 if even|_|01 the un|_|01 can provide|_|06 her the assistance|_|02 she needs|_|02 . what it really|_|01 comes|_|04 down to is a matter|_|02 of trying|_|01 to get|_|01 out of a bad|_|01 situation|_|01 in favor|_|02 of one|_|06 that is much|_|05 more promising|_|01 . i really|_|01 think|_|03 this is unfair|_|01 to me .
" it is so sad|_|02 to hear|_|02 about the poor|_|01 victims|_|02 of the train|_|04 derailment|_|01 . i feel|_|04 that these types|_|03 of accidents|_|02 could be reduced|_|01 if proper|_|02 maintenance|_|03 and planning|_|03 are administered|_|02 more carefully|_|01 . when using|_|03 mass|_|03 transit|_|01 the last|_|05 thing|_|11 anyone should be thinking|_|01 about is " " are we going|_|04 to die|_|04 this time|_|04 " " . when you travel|_|06 you want|_|01 to have fun|_|02 and you hope|_|02 for a great|_|01 time|_|04 . these types|_|03 of tragedies|_|01 should be scrutinized|_|01 by the governments|_|01 where it happens|_|02 frequently|_|01 . "
the first|_|01 time|_|01 i tried|_|01 to commit|_|06 suicide|_|01 was the most painful|_|01 . two|_|01 months|_|02 after starting|_|10 my first|_|01 year|_|03 of high|_|02 school|_|05 , boys|_|04 started|_|10 treating|_|01 me like|_|02 a prostitute|_|01 . my “ friend|_|05 ” at the time|_|01 told|_|05 everyone that i enjoyed|_|02 the rape|_|03 . that i wanted|_|02 it . i was called|_|09 a whore|_|01 and a slut|_|02 by my peers|_|01 . older|_|01 boys|_|04 attempted|_|01 to have their way|_|11 with me . i started|_|10 acting|_|01 like|_|02 one|_|01 . i sent|_|03 nudes|_|04 to anyone that would ask|_|01 . i believed|_|05 i was only needed|_|01 for sex|_|03 , that i awns’t worth|_|01 anything other than my sexual|_|02 appeal|_|01 . i was 13|_|01 . i was self|_|02 harming|_|01 any chance|_|02 i could . my wrists|_|01 , legs|_|05 and chest|_|02 were full|_|05 of cuts|_|16 . eventually|_|01 self|_|01 harming|_|01 did’t help|_|02 anymore|_|01 . i did’t want|_|02 to live|_|07 anymore|_|01 . the thing|_|08 that pushed|_|02 me over the edge|_|03 was when my “ friend|_|05 ” invited|_|04 me to a group|_|02 chat|_|01 with her minions|_|01 . they talked|_|05 about me like|_|02
i do n't really|_|01 feel|_|05 much|_|04 of anything when i read|_|06 about this sort|_|01 of incident|_|01 since it happens|_|02 all the time|_|02 , i guess|_|02 if i had to come|_|20 up with something i would say|_|01 i feel|_|05 vaguely|_|01 annoyed|_|01 and irritated|_|01 , i do n't see|_|01 why people|_|03 ca|_|01 n't manage|_|02 to watch|_|01 sports|_|02 games|_|01 in an orderly|_|01 , non|_|01 - violent|_|03 manner|_|01 , so the fact|_|03 that we have to deal|_|02 with this nonsense|_|01 every|_|02 time|_|02 a popular|_|04 sporting|_|02 event|_|01 happens|_|02 is irritating|_|01 . i think|_|01 that it should not be difficult|_|01 for people|_|03 to conduct|_|02 themselves appropriately|_|01 , so it is frustrating|_|01 that this sort|_|01 of thing|_|05 happens|_|02 so often|_|05 during sporting|_|01 and other events|_|01 .
i think|_|03 what the father|_|05 did was a noble|_|04 gesture|_|03 . sometimes|_|01 justice|_|02 is n't always|_|04 served|_|01 in jail|_|01 . i think|_|03 it is a shame|_|02 that he is being punished|_|01 for what he did . what is more important|_|05 however|_|02 is that the father|_|05 got|_|01 his|_|01 revenge|_|01 . sometimes|_|01 it is necessary|_|02 to take|_|04 justice|_|02 in your own hands|_|06 . i applaud|_|01 the father|_|05 for what he did .
veterans|_|03 deserve|_|01 all the support|_|06 from this nation|_|04 . they put|_|07 in risk|_|04 their lives|_|13 for us|_|01 , for our freedom|_|01 and security|_|09 . most of the people|_|01 have no idea|_|06 what those people|_|01 have seen|_|01 and experienced|_|03 in a war|_|01 zone|_|04 , or the toll|_|03 that these experiences|_|02 can take|_|05 on an individual|_|01 , matter|_|06 how strong|_|03 they are , i 'm sure|_|07 they have suffered|_|10 traumatic|_|02 experience|_|02 , and they really|_|01 need|_|01 help|_|02 before their battles|_|01 .
how sad|_|02 , if you get|_|02 a chance|_|01 read|_|01 this and maybe|_|01 share|_|01 , it could be the difference|_|03 for this person|_|01 to find|_|02 her family|_|08 ! sometimes|_|01 i see|_|02 these announcements|_|02 and i usually|_|01 read|_|06 and share|_|01 them , i hope|_|03 they find|_|02 who she is and most importantly|_|01 i hope|_|03 they find|_|02 her family|_|08 and get|_|02 her some help|_|01 . i think|_|05 the more people|_|01 see|_|02 , read|_|06 and share|_|01 this info|_|01 , the bigger|_|01 the chance|_|01 to find|_|02 her identity|_|02 and family|_|08 , imagine|_|02 if it was someone|_|01 you knew|_|11 .
it saddens|_|01 me to think|_|09 about a young|_|01 iron|_|04 passing|_|01 away|_|06 . i can not help|_|05 but question|_|02 the circumstances|_|02 surrounding|_|01 its death|_|02 . my heart|_|01 goes|_|01 out to the person|_|01 who worked|_|01 hard|_|01 to try|_|01 to save|_|08 its life|_|08 and is grieving|_|02 over the loss|_|02 of that hard|_|01 battle|_|01 . as a wildlife|_|01 rehabilitation|_|03 i know|_|01 the struggle|_|01 all too well|_|07 . i understand|_|01 how it feels|_|05 to forgo|_|01 sleep|_|03 and food|_|03 because you are working|_|01 to save|_|08 an animal|_|01 . it is painful|_|01 . but if you can save|_|08 even|_|04 one|_|06 , it will make|_|36 it all worth|_|02 it in the end|_|08 .
i read|_|10 an article|_|04 about the loud|_|01 music|_|05 shooter|_|02 , not sure|_|08 if you 've heard|_|03 about this case|_|09 in florida|_|01 . it seems|_|02 like|_|02 they 've upheld|_|03 the murder|_|01 conviction|_|02 for the man|_|10 who shot|_|03 a black|_|14 teen|_|01 during an argument|_|04 about loud|_|01 music|_|05 being played|_|31 . it did seem|_|02 more like|_|02 murder|_|01 and not so much|_|01 like|_|02 an actual|_|03 self|_|02 - defense|_|01 situation|_|03 .
this article|_|04 was about a rash|_|02 of fires|_|09 in the south|_|01 , particularly|_|01 appalachia|_|01 . it mentioned|_|01 dry|_|16 conditions|_|01 causing|_|02 numerous|_|01 fires|_|09 and contributing|_|02 to pollution|_|03 that made|_|03 the air|_|01 dangerous|_|01 and unpleasant|_|01 to breathe|_|08 . it also|_|02 said|_|01 that some of the fires|_|09 were probably|_|01 caused|_|02 by arson|_|01 , but did n't dwell|_|01 too much|_|01 on that aspect|_|02 . the quoted|_|03 official|_|02 mentioned|_|01 that dry|_|16 conditions|_|01 meant|_|04 more fires|_|09 could easily|_|03 be accidentally|_|01 started|_|08 and that was a danger|_|03 .
can you imagine|_|02 being forced|_|08 to live|_|02 in such a violent|_|02 place|_|06 ? ? a place|_|06 where your life|_|08 is at risk|_|02 all day|_|03 everyday|_|03 ? these poor|_|03 people|_|01 have learned|_|01 to live|_|02 in extreme|_|04 fear|_|03 everyday|_|03 . imagine|_|02 purposely|_|01 bringing|_|03 babies|_|03 into the world|_|01 when this is happening|_|01 where you live|_|02 . i would n't do it , i would never|_|02 on purpose|_|02 bring|_|03 another|_|01 life|_|08 into this kind|_|01 of situation|_|02 . god|_|01 bless|_|03 these poor|_|03 souls|_|01 .
the war|_|04 in syria|_|01 is one|_|06 in which the us|_|01 needs|_|01 to get|_|02 out of . we have no reason|_|01 to be involved|_|01 there , and staying|_|01 involved|_|01 will just risk|_|01 the war|_|04 expanding|_|01 and making|_|03 the region|_|04 worse|_|01 off . we need|_|01 to get|_|02 out , like|_|02 , yesterday|_|02 . also|_|02 , we are wasting|_|01 billions|_|03 on this that could be used|_|01 for universal|_|03 health|_|02 care|_|06 and increasing|_|02 the minimum|_|02 wage|_|01 .
the fact|_|04 that this article|_|04 shows|_|01 the global|_|01 gender|_|04 gap|_|01 not being equal|_|01 until 2196 is particularly|_|01 disturbing|_|11 . and , i wonder|_|03 why women|_|01 have dropped|_|06 out of the workforce|_|01 globally|_|01 ? i mean|_|03 , i did drop|_|06 out but only after 30|_|01 years|_|03 of employment|_|01 . it seems|_|04 as if , in this day|_|01 and age|_|01 , you 'd hear|_|04 that omen|_|01 's participation|_|07 in the workforce|_|01 had increased|_|02 , not decreased|_|02 .
it 's always|_|04 sad|_|02 to hear|_|02 of entertainers|_|01 , especially|_|01 comics|_|01 , losing|_|11 their spark|_|01 because of dementia|_|01 . i was n't really|_|01 a monty python|_|03 fan|_|01 myself but i 've heard|_|02 a lot|_|02 about them growing|_|07 up and it seems|_|04 that they were a great|_|03 deal|_|06 of fun|_|02 for their fans|_|01 . i know|_|04 they influenced|_|01 and produced|_|07 some favorite|_|01 comics|_|01 of mine|_|02 .
oh|_|01 , yahoo|_|03 . i wonder|_|03 what country|_|02 they 're talking|_|01 about ? probably|_|01 russia|_|01 . it 's always|_|02 russia|_|01 nowadays|_|01 . i 'm glad|_|03 i stopped|_|01 using|_|01 yahoo|_|03 years|_|02 ago|_|01 . i feel|_|04 vindicated|_|03 . not that google|_|01 or any of the other services|_|09 i give|_|01 information|_|05 to are immune|_|04 . it 's just that yahoo|_|03 has such a bad|_|03 , ugly|_|01 , sad|_|02 interface|_|04 . and now this .
" global|_|01 warming|_|02 is really|_|01 serious|_|01 . sometimes|_|01 i think|_|13 , is this a good|_|12 time|_|02 for having kids|_|01 ? i do n't want|_|02 my kids|_|01 have a chaotic|_|02 world|_|08 , full|_|06 of adversity|_|02 and contamination|_|03 . also|_|02 , i think|_|13 my nation|_|04 is in " " control|_|02 " " for now , but future|_|03 seem|_|02 different|_|03 . people|_|01 now do n't care|_|02 about being correct|_|05 and helpful|_|01 to everyone , a lot|_|05 of people|_|01 is dishonest|_|01 and disloyal|_|01 . we need|_|02 a society|_|02 that we can trust|_|01 . our world|_|08 is extremely|_|01 corrupt|_|02 , i think|_|13 this can be change|_|01 if we gave|_|03 enough|_|02 education|_|05 to all generations|_|01 since they are kids|_|01 . "
human|_|03 traffickers|_|01 must|_|01 be some of the most loathsome|_|01 people|_|01 on this planet|_|02 . some may|_|01 think|_|09 they are doing good|_|13 things|_|08 trying|_|01 to get|_|01 people|_|01 to a better|_|13 place|_|01 , but these traffickers|_|01 do not see|_|02 people|_|01 and are wanting|_|03 to help|_|01 them . they see|_|02 them as money|_|01 , they take|_|02 advantage|_|01 of them and take|_|02 every|_|02 single|_|01 thing|_|08 they can from them while promising|_|04 them a better|_|13 life|_|02 . they do not care|_|02 about the safety|_|02 of people|_|01 and are just trying|_|01 to maximize|_|01 their profits|_|02 . the only reason|_|01 they would n't just get|_|01 rid|_|01 of the migrants|_|01 out at sea|_|03 after taking|_|02 all their belongings|_|01 is it may|_|01 be bad|_|09 for business|_|01 .
this is sort|_|01 of scary|_|01 . i think|_|05 it could have something to do with water|_|01 contamination|_|01 . there are so many|_|01 types|_|05 of bacteria|_|01 . there are also|_|02 so many|_|01 different|_|01 types|_|05 of pesticides|_|01 used|_|01 in farming|_|07 . i do think|_|05 it 's strange|_|02 that this happened|_|03 in a small|_|08 area|_|01 , which again , would lead|_|23 me to think|_|05 contamination|_|01 of the ground|_|02 or water|_|01 . i wonder|_|02 about the reference|_|01 to the cattle|_|01 , thinking|_|05 that might|_|01 have something to do with it . scary|_|01 stuff|_|01 !
did you hear|_|02 about that indian|_|01 girl|_|02 from kashmir|_|01 who got|_|01 blinded|_|03 by the government|_|02 with pellet|_|02 guns|_|02 that have sharp|_|09 edges|_|03 . she was n't doing anything but standing|_|04 by a window|_|01 . these corrupt|_|01 governments|_|02 are so evil|_|01 . kashmir|_|01 is being fought|_|02 over and innocent|_|01 people|_|01 are being killed|_|05 and hurt|_|06 . it really|_|01 is disgusting|_|02 what these governments|_|02 are doing .
i recently|_|01 read|_|09 an article|_|04 about how the band|_|08 eagles|_|04 of death|_|01 metal|_|01 visited|_|01 the paris|_|04 attacks|_|05 memorial|_|03 . a year|_|03 before they were playing|_|14 at a concert|_|01 hall|_|06 when the attacks|_|05 occurred|_|03 a year|_|03 prior|_|01 . sting|_|05 was the first|_|02 person|_|01 to play|_|14 at he concert|_|02 hall|_|06 since the attacks|_|05 . the front|_|01 man|_|08 of the eagles|_|04 of death|_|01 metal|_|01 was denied|_|03 access|_|02 to the event|_|02 . he had told|_|02 fox|_|01 news|_|01 that the muslim|_|01 security|_|09 collaborated|_|02 with the attackers|_|01 at the concert|_|01 hall|_|06 .
not that we need|_|02 to necessarily|_|01 get|_|01 ourselves overly|_|01 involved|_|01 in the affairs|_|01 and well|_|03 - being of other countries|_|04 , but we should definitely|_|01 be paying|_|10 attention|_|01 to what is going|_|01 on in the world|_|08 around|_|04 us|_|01 . there is human|_|03 suffering|_|05 everywhere|_|01 and i think|_|03 that most of the time|_|02 we are completely|_|01 oblivious|_|01 to it , or we do n't want|_|02 to face|_|03 it . i believe|_|01 that it is a good|_|13 thing|_|01 to be able|_|03 to realize|_|08 how cruel|_|01 human|_|03 beings can be to one|_|05 another|_|01 and to appreciate|_|01 what we have when we have it and not take|_|05 things|_|01 for granted|_|05 . considering|_|05 we could always|_|04 have it much|_|01 worse|_|09 .
it 's just so distressing|_|01 to read|_|05 about the negative|_|08 effects|_|02 we constantly|_|02 have on defenseless|_|02 animals|_|01 . human|_|03 beings need|_|01 to be more respectful|_|02 of the planet|_|02 and its native|_|03 biodiversity|_|01 . i just finished|_|02 reading|_|05 an article|_|04 about an endangered|_|02 species|_|01 in the gulf|_|01 called|_|01 the aquitaine|_|01 that is slated|_|02 to be extinct|_|01 by 2022 due|_|02 to nothing|_|01 beyond|_|03 happening|_|03 to be in the water|_|06 where people|_|01 are fishing|_|02 . it 's just so thoughtless|_|02 , so shortsighted|_|09 , and so frustratingly preventable|_|01 .
there are all these people|_|03 protesting|_|03 on both sides|_|06 of this issue|_|02 but where were many|_|01 of these people|_|03 at the voting|_|01 booths|_|04 ? ? if everyone who is so against trump|_|02 came|_|21 out and voted|_|01 maybe|_|01 we would n't be in this situation|_|02 in the first|_|02 place|_|06 ! ! and all the people|_|03 who voted|_|01 for third|_|01 party|_|05 candidates|_|02 know|_|01 that you contributed|_|03 to this as well|_|09 because you threw|_|08 away|_|02 your vote|_|01 !

this article|_|02 is just awful|_|01 . biko hiram is an extremist|_|01 group|_|01 that needs|_|02 to be stopped|_|05 by any means|_|01 necessary|_|02 . the fact|_|03 of the matter|_|02 is these people|_|01 are using|_|06 religion|_|02 as an excuse|_|03 to rape|_|01 and kill|_|01 woman|_|02 and children|_|03 , and thatch|_|01 one|_|01 of the most unmoral and unethical|_|01 things|_|12 i can think|_|03 of . these poor|_|01 women|_|02 and children|_|03 are not only kidnapped|_|01 and drugged|_|02 , but they are also|_|02 dealing|_|04 with being raped|_|07 and having their loved|_|01 ones|_|02 killed|_|01 . this is an awful|_|01 and tragic|_|01 issue|_|02 , and this is something that needs|_|02 to be shown|_|02 throughout|_|01 the entire|_|04 world|_|08 that these people|_|01 are bad|_|01 and need|_|02 to be stopped|_|05 .

i think|_|02 its sick|_|06 having these kids|_|02 working|_|02 . these kids|_|02 should be playing|_|05 and having an education|_|03 . why are they doing this ? this just shows|_|02 you how much|_|01 people|_|01 care|_|02 about money|_|03 . its disgusting|_|01 . human|_|03 beings are disgusting|_|02 . i feel|_|05 so ashamed|_|01 . god|_|01 will punish|_|01 all of these people|_|01 . we are just being controlled|_|05 . someone|_|01 needs|_|03 to put|_|01 this to an end|_|14 . i really|_|01 hope|_|03 these children|_|02 get|_|03 the life|_|02 they deserve|_|01 . this is why there is a lot|_|05 of people|_|01 suffering|_|03 from depression|_|01 because of these terrible|_|02 things|_|01 going|_|03 on .
a mayor|_|01 and his|_|01 bodyguards|_|02 in the philippines|_|01 was shot|_|01 and killed|_|01 by local|_|03 law|_|01 enforcement|_|01 . he was in to the illegal|_|01 drug|_|01 business|_|01 . he was elected|_|02 to take|_|06 a stance|_|01 against drugs|_|01 . it 's really|_|01 weird|_|02 to think|_|01 that a mayor|_|01 was the one|_|02 taking|_|06 part|_|09 in the illegal|_|01 drug|_|01 trade|_|03 . it makes|_|43 me wonder|_|03 who can you really|_|01 trust|_|06 . he was said|_|09 to be a narc|_|01 - politician|_|01 . sad|_|02 to think|_|01 the people|_|01 ca|_|01 n't even|_|01 trust|_|06 his|_|01 own mayor|_|01 .

i read|_|06 an article|_|02 about a young|_|01 mother|_|02 - to - be who lost|_|01 her twins|_|03 , prematurely|_|02 , after being shot|_|17 in the stomach|_|04 . it really|_|01 raises|_|02 a good|_|13 question|_|02 for me and a lot|_|05 of people|_|01 , which is : when do we consider|_|01 a life|_|11 to begin|_|07 ? as for me , i consider|_|01 life|_|11 to begin|_|07 when a human|_|03 takes|_|01 his|_|01 or her first|_|02 breath|_|01 . possibly|_|02 a religious|_|02 thing|_|09 , i guess|_|02 -- my parents|_|01 and grandparents|_|01 and entire|_|02 family|_|08 believed|_|01 the same . but because there is no unified|_|01 belief|_|01 system|_|08 as to this issue|_|06 , i find|_|02 it difficult|_|02 to form|_|03 an opinion|_|01 as to how people|_|01 should be prosecuted|_|03 when a fetus|_|01 is harmed|_|01 . i really|_|01 wish|_|06 there were one|_|01 answer|_|02 to this problem|_|02 .
i do n't really|_|01 understand|_|02 the uproar|_|01 over some birds|_|01 . maybe|_|01 i am being just unsympathetic|_|01 , or maybe|_|01 i 'm not as understanding|_|02 as i thought|_|02 i originally|_|01 was . to spend|_|02 all this money|_|01 , and all this time|_|02 , to save|_|09 these birds|_|01 , seems|_|02 kind|_|01 of silly|_|01 to me . why do n't we focus|_|02 the funds|_|02 on something else|_|03 that actually|_|04 helps|_|05 people|_|03 ?

the whole|_|02 situation|_|03 with dr.|_|01 luke|_|02 and keisha got|_|02 way|_|12 out of hand|_|06 . i feel|_|05 so bad|_|01 for keisha because she simply|_|04 became|_|01 a victim|_|02 of the music|_|05 industry|_|02 and lost|_|07 her voice|_|05 in the process|_|03 . dr.|_|01 luke|_|02 should be ashamed|_|01 of himself for treating|_|01 keisha so badly|_|06 and trying|_|01 to make|_|02 her into something that she was n't . i 'm glad|_|03 that she got|_|02 the help|_|02 that she needed|_|03 and is making|_|02 strides|_|03 toward her own recovery|_|03 .

even|_|01 though|_|01 donald trump|_|02 condemns|_|01 these actions|_|01 by his|_|01 supporters|_|01 it does n't stop|_|04 the fact|_|04 that he incites|_|01 this sort|_|04 of behavior|_|02 with his|_|01 comments|_|02 and his|_|01 proposed|_|05 laws|_|04 . trumps|_|02 supporters|_|01 , well|_|01 a decent|_|06 majority|_|03 love|_|01 his|_|01 call|_|01 of racism|_|02 and bigotry|_|01 . it is no surprise|_|03 that his|_|01 supporters|_|01 are the epitome|_|01 of racism|_|02 nd|_|01 there behavior|_|02 is not spurring|_|01 .
hey friend|_|01 , can you believe|_|01 just how crazy|_|03 this is getting|_|01 over in the middle|_|04 east|_|05 ? my heart|_|03 weeps|_|02 so much|_|01 for the families|_|01 and just the innocent|_|04 bystanders|_|01 that have to deal|_|02 with this . imagine|_|02 if your home|_|07 was getting|_|01 bombed|_|07 and who knew|_|01 where you would get|_|01 your food|_|02 next|_|01 . i ca|_|01 n't imagine|_|02 the pain|_|04 that they go|_|01 through on a daily|_|01 basis|_|03 meanwhile|_|01 i can go|_|01 get|_|01 any kind|_|01 of food|_|02 i want|_|01 or drinks|_|01 or whatever|_|01 . not a worry|_|02 in the world|_|08 for me , meanwhile|_|02 these people|_|03 are being bombed|_|07 and just all around|_|04 treated|_|01 like|_|02 cattle|_|01 . we need|_|02 peace|_|05 !
things|_|08 are really|_|01 heating|_|04 up i font|_|01 know|_|10 how much|_|01 longer|_|02 we can keep|_|02 things|_|08 up like|_|02 this . if we can help|_|01 they should tell|_|02 us|_|01 clearly|_|01 how we can help|_|01 out so that the temperature|_|02 does n't get|_|01 too high|_|02 . if it gets|_|01 too hot|_|01 then things|_|08 will be really|_|01 messed|_|02 up for us|_|01 and our childrens|_|03 futures|_|03 will be in danger|_|02
death|_|05 to all cops|_|05 ! we can not allow|_|01 the police|_|01 force|_|01 to continue|_|02 existing|_|02 . they are nothing|_|01 more than government|_|02 sanctioned|_|03 mass|_|05 murderers|_|01 that exist|_|02 to protect|_|02 white|_|11 capitalist|_|02 interests|_|03 by slaughtering|_|01 hundreds|_|01 . we must|_|01 deceptively|_|01 destroy|_|04 the police|_|01 as a concept|_|01 without any hesitation|_|02 or remorse|_|01 . all police|_|01 are our enemies|_|02 ! there are no good|_|03 cops|_|05 !
another|_|01 sad|_|01 story|_|02 . i am deeply|_|01 sorry|_|01 for the families|_|04 of the innocent|_|05 civilians|_|01 that were killed|_|09 but our united|_|01 states|_|04 army|_|01 has to do what it has to do in order|_|14 to protect|_|01 our great|_|03 country|_|04 and keep|_|04 us|_|01 all safe|_|02 as americans|_|01 . living|_|11 in those types|_|06 of countries|_|04 is a risk|_|04 and sometimes|_|01 innocent|_|05 peoples|_|01 lives|_|01 have to be taken|_|05 in order|_|14 to keep|_|04 us|_|01 safe|_|02 and protect|_|01 our country|_|04 .
this really|_|01 does n't seem|_|02 that much|_|01 different|_|03 to me than capital|_|05 punishment|_|01 which is accepted|_|04 in our country|_|04 . yes|_|01 , it 's cruel|_|01 and seems|_|02 to be brutal|_|01 but at the same time|_|06 it could be a good|_|13 way|_|11 of discouraging|_|02 people|_|01 to commit|_|01 such crimes|_|02 . on the other hand|_|06 a victim|_|02 's situation|_|01 will not be improved|_|03 or reversed|_|05 because their perpetrator|_|01 has been harmed|_|01 in the same way|_|11 .
it seems|_|02 a horny|_|04 male|_|01 college|_|01 student|_|01 has finally|_|01 taken|_|15 up the courage|_|01 not to pursue|_|04 love|_|01 , but to rape|_|02 his|_|01 potential|_|01 lover|_|01 , what a disgusting|_|01 act|_|02 and moral|_|02 corruption|_|05 , the amount|_|02 of emotional|_|06 trauma|_|02 done to the female|_|03 victim|_|02 is permanent|_|02 and she would never|_|02 feel|_|05 safe|_|02 again , i hope|_|03 he gets|_|02 to sentence|_|01 to jail|_|01 long|_|02 enough|_|01 he thought|_|03 through

man|_|08 is there some issue|_|02 with the quality|_|03 of air|_|08 in india|_|01 . i 'm not sure|_|06 if i would be willing|_|01 to take|_|06 a trip|_|07 there . there seems|_|02 to be a heavy|_|23 smog|_|01 lingering|_|01 over the town|_|01 that has caused|_|02 a number|_|01 of respiratory|_|01 illnesses|_|01 as well|_|07 as shut|_|02 down some schools|_|05 . i have just read|_|06 that air|_|08 quality|_|03 readings|_|02 have been taken|_|06 from some scientists|_|01 . they found|_|05 the quality|_|03 of the air|_|08 to be like|_|02 smoking|_|01 40|_|01 packs|_|08 of cigarettes|_|01 a day|_|07 . yet|_|01 , the local|_|02 media|_|02 is reporting|_|02 something more like|_|02 two|_|01 dozen|_|01 . i 'm not sure|_|06 who to believe|_|05 but either|_|01 way|_|12 it seems|_|02 like|_|02 quite|_|03 a dangerous|_|02 situation|_|03 to me .
i wish|_|02 more people|_|03 would donate|_|01 food|_|03 that 's still|_|01 good|_|20 instead|_|01 of throwing|_|06 it away|_|02 . there 's so many|_|01 people|_|03 who gladly|_|01 take|_|01 anything to eat|_|02 and there 's people|_|03 just throwing|_|06 out perfectly|_|02 good|_|20 food|_|03 . there should be some way|_|10 to easily|_|01 take|_|01 food|_|03 or even|_|03 have someone|_|01 come|_|04 pick|_|01 it up and then the food|_|03 can go|_|01 to needy|_|01 starving|_|02 people|_|03 .
did you hear|_|02 that 1|_|01 person|_|01 died|_|05 and 7|_|01 more were injured|_|01 in indonesia|_|01 ? it is pretty|_|01 amazing|_|01 how hearing|_|02 about these things|_|12 in other parts|_|01 of the world|_|03 do n't surprise|_|02 me but if they happened|_|02 here where we live|_|02 it would be very shocking|_|01 and disturbing|_|11 to hear|_|02 about . i bet|_|08 they were motivated|_|01 by religion|_|02 because over there they are very strict|_|03 and kill|_|01 people|_|01 who do n't agree|_|01 with them .
this guy|_|03 got|_|24 fucked|_|01 . it sucks|_|04 for him , but there ’s nothing|_|01 you can really|_|01 do about these things|_|01 , besides|_|01 deal|_|02 with it . there ’s always|_|02 going|_|01 to be inefficiency|_|01 and points|_|03 of failure|_|07 in any bureaucratic|_|01 system|_|08 right|_|07 ? maybe|_|01 the cops|_|05 will get|_|24 their shit|_|04 together|_|03 and sort|_|03 it out for him , before he has to jump|_|02 through all the bureaucratic|_|01 hoops|_|02 because of their initial|_|01 mistake|_|02 .
it is just sad|_|02 that someone|_|01 would think|_|01 this is an acceptable|_|02 way|_|05 to resolve|_|05 any problem|_|01 . he clearly|_|01 needed|_|01 more help|_|02 than he was getting|_|02 and it is unfortunate|_|03 that it was recognized|_|02 that he needed|_|01 help|_|02 or the mother|_|05 did n't take|_|29 steps|_|03 to leave|_|01 sooner|_|01 . i guess|_|02 in life|_|01 sometimes|_|01 you just ca|_|01 n't tell|_|01 what is going|_|03 to happen|_|01 or what will set|_|12 someone|_|01 off .
get|_|01 too close|_|01 to a skunk|_|01 , and it will spray|_|03 you with a noxious|_|01 mix|_|03 of sulfuric|_|01 thistles|_|01 , the chemicals|_|01 in raw|_|07 onions|_|03 that make|_|03 you cry|_|01 . the spray|_|06 does n't just stink|_|01 : it chokes|_|06 your lungs|_|01 and causes|_|02 temporary|_|07 blindness|_|01 , allowing|_|01 the skunk|_|01 to get|_|03 away|_|02 . the scent|_|02 is produced|_|03 in anal|_|02 glands|_|01 at the base|_|03 of the tail|_|07 , and is fired|_|06 through nipples|_|01 attached|_|01 to the glands|_|01 . impressive|_|02 muscle|_|04 control|_|02 allows|_|01 skunks|_|01 to target|_|01 their enemy|_|02 's face|_|01 at a distance|_|06 of over 2m . without this deterrent|_|01 , the slow|_|01 - moving|_|01 skunks|_|01 would be unable|_|01 to escape|_|05 from predators|_|02 .

it 's a little|_|08 bit|_|05 troubling|_|01 that these teachers|_|02 would be forced|_|01 to leave|_|08 because of political|_|03 tension|_|06 . it 's not right|_|07 that they would lose|_|05 their jobs|_|01 and their homes|_|01 . there should be another|_|01 way|_|06 to resolve|_|06 this issue|_|01 . it 's good|_|12 that people|_|01 are protesting|_|03 this and they should be . teachers|_|02 play|_|05 such a huge|_|01 role|_|03 and it will not be good|_|12 for the students|_|01 to be in the middle|_|04 of this .

this is no surprise|_|03 . as with every|_|02 year|_|03 before it for the past|_|01 couple|_|02 decades|_|01 , this was the hottest|_|16 year|_|03 on record|_|01 . i do not know|_|01 how so many|_|01 people|_|03 can take|_|01 irrefutable|_|01 scientific|_|02 evidence|_|02 like|_|02 this and still|_|04 not only question|_|01 , but outright|_|01 deny|_|04 that global|_|01 warming|_|02 is happening|_|01 . it makes|_|27 me angry|_|03 that we are killing|_|07 this planet|_|02 and there are so many|_|01 people|_|03 that are simply|_|04 too stupid|_|01 too admit|_|04 it is happening|_|01 and fix|_|02 it .
hello|_|01 , how are you doing men|_|01 ? remember|_|01 that chat|_|01 we had a week|_|01 ago|_|01 about haiti|_|01 ? i was just reading|_|09 an article|_|04 about it , never|_|02 thought|_|02 things|_|12 could have been so bad|_|01 , they are even|_|03 worse|_|01 than what i imagine|_|02 worst|_|05 than what we talked|_|02 about . i find|_|01 it funny|_|04 how we are so enclosed|_|02 in our small|_|04 little|_|01 world|_|03 , while in chicago|_|03 we are celebrating|_|06 about cubs|_|03 victory|_|01 in over 100|_|01 years|_|03 , in haiti|_|01 , they are suffering|_|09 for water|_|06 and food|_|03 .
i wonder|_|03 if this problems|_|01 exists|_|02 in the u.s.|_|01 as well|_|12 as the uk|_|01 ? this is a consideration|_|03 , since we both have garden|_|03 ponds|_|01 . maybe|_|01 we should learn|_|01 more about how to keep|_|04 our ponds|_|01 more sanitary|_|01 for the frogs|_|03 ! i have noticed|_|04 a lot|_|04 of frogs|_|03 in mine|_|02 , so this is interesting|_|01 readying|_|02 , anyway|_|02 . this is just another|_|01 way|_|06 that humans|_|02 interfere|_|01 with the natural|_|04 environment|_|02 , i guess|_|02 .
the modeling|_|01 industry|_|02 is very different|_|01 than the rest|_|07 of the world|_|08 it seems|_|04 . i read|_|08 an article|_|02 that male|_|01 models|_|01 , even|_|02 the best|_|03 ones|_|02 , are paid|_|10 a fraction|_|03 of what female|_|03 models|_|01 earn|_|08 . i guess|_|02 this is because a lot|_|02 more money|_|03 is spent|_|02 by woman|_|02 in the fashion|_|01 and personal|_|04 products|_|01 industry|_|02 . the article|_|02 says|_|01 more men|_|01 are grooming|_|05 themselves and it 's starting|_|02 to bring|_|01 wages|_|01 for male|_|03 models|_|01 slowly|_|01 up . i guess|_|02 that 's just business|_|01 .
i feel|_|11 that we are prioritizing|_|01 efforts|_|02 of saving|_|06 the planet|_|02 in the wrong|_|06 way|_|11 . we want|_|01 to ban|_|02 this or that , and that 's great|_|01 and all . however|_|01 , we are missing|_|02 the bigger|_|01 picture|_|01 . we need|_|02 to focus|_|05 on building|_|01 a world|_|01 that co|_|01 exists|_|02 with nature|_|05 , instead|_|01 of just saving|_|06 little|_|08 bits|_|04 of it here and there . while some strive|_|02 to save|_|06 this or that , there are a million|_|01 other things|_|11 destroying|_|01 it further|_|02 . we need|_|02 to end|_|04 the destruction|_|06 of our global|_|01 ecosystem|_|01 , and not pick|_|01 and choose|_|03 species|_|01 to save|_|06 . other wise|_|01 there will be nothing|_|01 left|_|08 , and those efforts|_|02 would have been in vein|_|05 .
i just read|_|06 this article|_|04 about a scandal|_|02 involving|_|01 a person|_|03 trying|_|01 to rent|_|03 a place|_|01 from someone|_|01 else|_|03 , but then it turned|_|10 out that this person|_|03 was using|_|01 it for personal|_|01 reasons|_|01 because the place|_|01 the other person|_|03 was renting|_|03 was n't own bu the person|_|03 they thought|_|09 . it would be interesting|_|01 if the author|_|01 of the article|_|04 did n't try|_|01 so hard|_|01 to sound|_|02 like|_|02 a kid|_|01 using|_|01 slang|_|02 .
i had no idea|_|03 there is a stunning|_|01 process|_|06 when killing|_|02 chickens|_|04 , but it makes|_|03 sense|_|05 . unfortunately|_|01 it seems|_|02 to not work|_|03 very well|_|07 . for all these pieces|_|05 of convoluted|_|01 technology|_|01 being used|_|01 , no one|_|02 has been clever|_|03 enough|_|01 to think|_|03 of the solution|_|01 that we could eat|_|06 less|_|01 meat|_|01 . certainly|_|01 it 's no secret|_|01 that animal|_|01 agriculture|_|01 is terrible|_|01 for the planet|_|02 . hopefully|_|02 this will be the next|_|02 piece|_|05 in a long|_|02 line|_|02 of information|_|01 pushing|_|02 us|_|01 towards vegetarianism|_|01 .
this is terrible|_|01 , but what i find|_|10 hard|_|01 to believe|_|01 is that there are still|_|04 that many|_|01 yahoo|_|03 accounts|_|05 in the world|_|01 that are n't spam|_|01 bots|_|01 . or some other kind|_|01 of bots|_|01 . anyway|_|02 , are n't you glad|_|01 i got|_|21 you on mail|_|04 ? i 'm glad|_|03 i shut|_|02 my yahoo|_|03 account|_|04 down a long|_|01 time|_|03 ago|_|01 . you should probably|_|01 do that , if you have n't , just for safety|_|06 's sake|_|01 .
the shark|_|01 attack|_|09 described|_|01 was distressing|_|01 . i 'm glad|_|03 to know|_|01 that the victim|_|02 is okay|_|01 . there is something about shark|_|01 attacks|_|09 that seems|_|02 so unexpected|_|01 and primal|_|01 ... really|_|01 frightening|_|01 . at the same time|_|02 i can appreciate|_|05 how people|_|03 want|_|05 to protect|_|01 the natural|_|09 wildlife|_|01 in the area|_|02 . its a tough|_|07 call|_|01 . i know|_|01 the measures|_|01 they take|_|35 will never|_|01 be perfect|_|03 . i guess|_|02 i 'm on the fence|_|01 about what they 're doing to protect|_|01 the sharks|_|01 .
and in other news|_|01 ushering|_|01 in the apocalypse|_|04 , paraguay|_|01 just mismanaged|_|01 their water|_|01 resources|_|03 so poorly|_|01 that one|_|01 of their rivers|_|01 almost|_|07 completely|_|01 has dried|_|02 up , in addition|_|02 to a drought|_|02 . i feel|_|04 like|_|04 these types|_|06 of things|_|12 are going|_|01 to become|_|01 extremely|_|01 common|_|06 in our near|_|01 future|_|03 thanks|_|02 to our current|_|01 president|_|01 's very uninterested|_|02 feelings|_|01 about global|_|01 warming|_|10 . we will likely|_|01 never|_|01 recover|_|04 since we have long|_|01 since not done enough|_|01 to combat|_|01 it , and millions|_|01 worldwide|_|01 are going|_|01 to suffer|_|08 and die|_|11 as stuff|_|01 like|_|04 this becomes|_|01 a seasonal|_|01 thing|_|12 .
to make|_|43 sure|_|06 that others are becoming|_|04 a known|_|04 way|_|11 with how others are going|_|03 to perform|_|01 , with how others are going|_|03 to be and how the people|_|03 are being shown|_|08 with how they 're being done . to make|_|43 sure|_|06 that i can be done with how it can be done with how it ca|_|01 n't be done . it has to be with how others are doing and making|_|43 sure|_|06 that has a lot|_|05 of things|_|08 , which make|_|43 others understand|_|02 with how their message|_|02 and be shown|_|08 and be helped|_|01 .
the russians|_|02 are always|_|02 being provocative|_|02 and trying|_|01 to show|_|02 force|_|01 especially|_|01 against the united|_|01 states|_|03 . there dangerous|_|02 ways|_|06 almost|_|07 cost|_|02 one|_|05 of there pilots|_|02 his|_|01 life|_|02 . this is yet|_|01 another|_|01 attempt|_|01 from russia|_|01 to yet|_|01 further distance|_|01 themselves from nato|_|01 and to show|_|02 they fully|_|01 support|_|09 the murderous|_|01 assad regime|_|01 .
take|_|01 a look|_|02 at this guy|_|03 ! what a flip|_|01 flipper|_|02 ! ! he seems|_|02 to endorse|_|01 whoever is popular|_|02 at the time|_|02 - trump|_|02 or obama . i also|_|02 hate|_|01 his|_|01 only tactic|_|01 for arguing|_|03 against his|_|01 opponent|_|04 , drawing|_|04 on his|_|01 personal|_|01 life|_|02 . instead|_|01 of highlighting|_|02 his|_|01 policies|_|03 , he ’s trying|_|01 to win|_|01 on popularity|_|01 . i would never|_|01 , ever|_|01 vote|_|05 for this guy|_|03 !
guys|_|03 , please|_|03 read|_|06 this . this issue|_|02 needs|_|01 to be seen|_|10 by more of us|_|01 and acknowledged|_|04 as something that happens|_|03 more than we realize|_|02 . is this something we can change|_|01 or work|_|02 on as a community|_|01 ? please|_|03 help|_|08 me think|_|13 of ways|_|12 we can work|_|02 on making|_|02 this a non|_|01 issue|_|02 in the future|_|03 for the next|_|03 generation|_|01 . this is our kids|_|02 and grand|_|07 kids|_|02 future|_|03 we are thinking|_|13 of .
i never|_|01 knew|_|05 there was a link|_|09 between depression|_|01 and birth|_|01 control|_|02 pills|_|05 . i thought|_|01 it would do the opposite|_|01 because it allows|_|01 women|_|02 to have a full|_|06 sex|_|04 like|_|04 without worrying|_|03 about pregnancy|_|01 , so they and their partners|_|01 can feel|_|06 more relaxed|_|01 and open|_|14 to exploring|_|02 their sexuality|_|04 . but now that i read|_|06 the article|_|04 i can see|_|05 the link|_|09 between hormone|_|01 fluctuations|_|01 and mood|_|02 disorders|_|01 since the two|_|01 effect|_|03 each other .
i do n't really|_|01 feel|_|05 much|_|05 of anything at all reading|_|04 this , i think|_|02 celebrity|_|01 deaths|_|05 are so common|_|03 in the news|_|01 that it is really|_|01 difficult|_|01 to conjure|_|07 up any emotion|_|01 about them . i guess|_|02 i feel|_|05 mild|_|01 interest|_|01 ? i learned|_|04 a few facts|_|03 about the singer|_|03 of a song|_|01 i have heard|_|04 fairly|_|01 often|_|05 over the years|_|03 , so it is interesting|_|01 to have new|_|01 information|_|01 , which always|_|01 feels|_|05 rewarding|_|03 in a way|_|11 . i guess|_|02 i should feel|_|05 sad|_|02 but i just do n't think|_|02 it 's possible|_|01 for me to feel|_|05 sadness|_|01 every|_|02 time|_|03 i read|_|06 about someone|_|01 being dead|_|06 . it makes|_|02 me feel|_|05 a bit|_|04 tired|_|01 i suppose|_|02 .
it 's kind|_|01 of amazing|_|01 how little|_|01 we knew|_|01 what was going|_|01 on back|_|03 then . there have certainly|_|01 been a lot|_|05 of changes|_|01 since that day|_|01 . i think|_|02 we can all take|_|01 comfort|_|02 in the fact|_|03 that the world|_|08 did n't end|_|01 that day|_|01 . even|_|01 with crazy|_|03 people|_|01 in charge|_|11 the earth|_|04 's people|_|01 seem|_|04 to be capable|_|01 of keeping|_|02 us|_|01 all on the right|_|01 track|_|11 . i mainly|_|01 worry|_|06 about my own self|_|02 now .
man|_|08 this news|_|04 story|_|03 is really|_|01 crazy|_|01 and it makes|_|42 me feel|_|05 uncomfortable|_|01 . just warning|_|03 you that the content|_|02 is kind|_|01 of disturbing|_|11 but it 's so scary|_|01 that things|_|12 like|_|04 this could happen|_|04 to just anyone walking|_|10 down the street|_|01 ! feel|_|01 free|_|06 to share|_|02 with anyone else|_|01 in australia|_|02 ; i hope|_|03 that poor|_|01 woman|_|02 is okay|_|01 .
i 'm so sad|_|02 to hear|_|02 about this , it just drives|_|11 me crazy|_|01 . i wish|_|02 that we would just do something once and for all to help|_|01 save|_|06 these people|_|03 from such suffering|_|03 . i guess|_|01 in the mean|_|05 time|_|02 all that i can do personally|_|01 is just pray|_|01 for the people|_|03 though|_|01 and hope|_|01 that soon|_|01 things|_|08 will get|_|02 better|_|13 , somehow|_|01 . does n't this just make|_|02 you so mad|_|02 ?
i just read|_|06 this article|_|04 about a murder|_|01 suicide|_|02 . this couple|_|02 , their three|_|02 kids|_|02 , and their dog|_|01 were all dead|_|01 from gunshot|_|01 wounds|_|04 . they even|_|01 shot|_|01 the dog|_|01 . :( the family|_|02 seemed|_|02 really|_|01 normal|_|04 . they had some issues|_|01 with stress|_|01 and the relationship|_|02 , but who does n't ? it 's really|_|01 eerie|_|02 that people|_|01 can be like|_|02 that and you wo n't even|_|01 know|_|01 it .
hello|_|01 ! i just read|_|03 this article|_|04 and would like|_|02 to share|_|02 it with you . it is about the oak|_|02 trees|_|01 dying|_|04 along|_|05 the west|_|08 coast|_|05 . i know|_|03 you are interested|_|01 and we 've talked|_|02 about this before . it seems|_|02 to be caused|_|02 by beetles|_|03 and they are multiplying|_|02 faster|_|01 because of warm|_|01 temperatures|_|02 . i wish|_|02 there was something more we were doing to stop|_|05 climate|_|02 change|_|03 and these warm|_|01 temps|_|01 !
the growing|_|02 back|_|06 and forth|_|03 tension|_|03 between the united|_|01 states|_|06 and russia|_|01 is really|_|01 worrisome|_|01 . one|_|02 minute|_|01 it seems|_|04 like|_|04 they like|_|04 us|_|01 and the next|_|03 they have nuclear|_|04 weapons|_|02 at the ready|_|02 and pointed|_|17 straight|_|03 at the united|_|01 states|_|06 . it 's scary|_|01 to think|_|06 about what could happen|_|04 especially|_|01 with the big|_|01 mouthed|_|04 president|_|01 we have .
seems|_|02 like|_|02 a pretty|_|01 ordinary|_|02 occurrence|_|02 . i 'm sure|_|08 their families|_|08 are upset|_|04 but i 'm less|_|03 sure|_|08 this kind|_|01 of story|_|01 deserves|_|01 space|_|08 in a newspaper|_|04 . a couple|_|02 people|_|03 got|_|18 sick|_|01 and they died|_|04 . anyway|_|02 , it 's a mildly|_|01 sad|_|02 story|_|01 but it 's not noteworthy|_|02 or newsworthy|_|01 . i do n't understand|_|02 why stories|_|01 like|_|02 this run|_|13 in the paper|_|04 .
" i just read|_|06 this article|_|04 about the nodal protest|_|03 movement|_|04 that had a ridiculous|_|03 headline|_|01 . it is like|_|02 they want|_|01 people|_|03 to have a negative|_|08 opinion|_|01 about this issue|_|01 , so they subtly|_|01 frame|_|04 it in a certain|_|06 way|_|02 . " " empty|_|01 your bank|_|02 account|_|03 " " to make|_|08 a donation|_|02 in support|_|11 is a very negative|_|08 way|_|02 of putting|_|01 things|_|09 , almost|_|07 like|_|02 psychological|_|01 priming|_|03 . anyway|_|01 , i wonder|_|02 how the pipeline|_|02 protest|_|03 movement|_|04 is going|_|02 to continue|_|01 under trump|_|02 . "
i ca|_|01 n't believe|_|01 that this place|_|01 was ever|_|03 given|_|01 a license|_|01 to carry|_|02 out their business|_|01 in the first|_|02 place|_|01 . these poor|_|02 dogs|_|01 died|_|11 a slow|_|04 painful|_|02 death|_|04 because the owners|_|02 of this kennel|_|01 were so careless|_|03 . did they not see|_|05 the dogs|_|01 suffering|_|10 ? how would they like|_|02 to be locked|_|02 up in a room|_|02 in those temps|_|01 ? make|_|01 sure|_|07 you are taking|_|02 your pets|_|01 to a reputable|_|01 kennel|_|01 if you do need|_|01 to board|_|01 them - i would have to see|_|05 something like|_|02 this happen|_|01 to anyone else|_|03 ! !
hello|_|01 , i have to tell|_|02 you something friend|_|01 , i have some curiosity|_|01 about an article|_|04 that i read|_|03 recently|_|01 , said|_|01 that donald trump|_|02 was elected|_|02 president|_|02 of the united|_|01 states|_|04 . the next|_|03 day|_|10 , a man|_|01 discovered|_|02 that someone|_|01 had painted|_|01 swastikas|_|01 in an abandoned|_|05 store|_|02 in south|_|01 philadelphia|_|01 , i was hoping|_|06 that this type|_|04 of information|_|05 could be in the article|_|04
honestly|_|02 it seems|_|02 that the world|_|08 is and has been providing|_|06 a place|_|07 for many|_|01 refugees|_|01 from all over for some time|_|06 . i find|_|13 it annoying|_|01 that despite|_|01 the people|_|03 from africa|_|01 and the middle|_|04 east|_|05 being evacuated|_|03 from there previous|_|01 worse|_|01 situations|_|02 they still|_|04 feel|_|05 the need|_|02 to incite|_|02 riot|_|02 and cause|_|01 chaos|_|04 and show|_|03 not only ungratefulness|_|01 , but barbarity|_|02 .
e|_|01 rate|_|04 government|_|02 funding|_|06 program|_|01 across|_|02 country|_|04 to connect|_|11 the school|_|02 from internet|_|01 and it hits|_|03 the hot|_|14 buttons|_|08 of education|_|01 , technology|_|01 , and good|_|01 jobs|_|11 at good|_|01 wages|_|01 in one|_|06 shot|_|01 and spreads|_|07 federal|_|01 monies to vendors|_|01 and consultants|_|01 in every|_|02 corner|_|11 of the country|_|04 . students|_|01 achievement|_|01 in 2013 bring|_|01 up the funding|_|11 2.3 billions|_|03 budget|_|02 to 4|_|01 billions|_|03 .
i think|_|01 we need|_|01 to remember|_|01 a few important|_|05 things|_|12 , psychologists|_|01 and psychiatrists|_|01 have very hard|_|01 times|_|03 . sometimes|_|01 the people|_|03 they are sent|_|02 to treat|_|08 are manipulative|_|01 to a point|_|01 they have fooled|_|01 family|_|01 , friends|_|03 and professionals|_|02 for years|_|03 . we also|_|02 have to acknowledge|_|04 those with underlying|_|02 mental|_|01 health|_|02 issues|_|02 who may|_|01 have been taken|_|02 advantage|_|02 of and used|_|04 by criminal|_|03 organizations|_|06 .
" that was the strangest|_|02 article|_|04 i 've ever|_|03 read|_|03 - i 'm not sure|_|08 why i read|_|03 it . was it an error|_|01 ? art/ ? it just said|_|11 something like|_|02 " " article|_|04 title|_|08 - article|_|04 - article|_|04 source|_|04 - date|_|07 . " " i 'm not sure|_|08 how to emotionally|_|01 react|_|02 to such a thing|_|12 since it had no emotional|_|03 content|_|02 whatsoever|_|01 , no biographical|_|01 content|_|02 , no factual|_|04 content|_|02 , no real|_|03 content|_|02 at all . seriously|_|01 , i believe|_|05 there is a malfunction|_|01 in the survey|_|03 . "
i just read|_|03 about a company|_|01 is threatening|_|03 one|_|01 of the largest|_|06 populations|_|05 of orangutan|_|01 's in indonesia|_|01 by chopping|_|06 down a critical|_|04 forest|_|02 to convert|_|05 it to a tree|_|03 plantation|_|01 . i think|_|01 it 's really|_|01 disgusting|_|02 that indonesia|_|01 knows|_|11 they need|_|02 to preserve|_|06 their land|_|02 and wild|_|01 life|_|13 but still|_|01 allows|_|01 things|_|09 like|_|02 this to happen|_|04 .
it is really|_|01 disheartening|_|01 to read|_|03 about these immigrants|_|01 from this article|_|04 who drowned|_|02 . it makes|_|08 me feel|_|05 anxious|_|02 and upset|_|01 how the whole|_|01 ordeal|_|02 happened|_|04 . it is a terrible|_|01 occurrence|_|01 that this had to happen|_|04 at the mediterranean|_|01 sea|_|01 . thankfully|_|02 there were some survivors|_|03 . the fact|_|03 that babies|_|04 were lost|_|11 makes|_|08 it that much|_|04 more emotional|_|03 to read|_|03 all of this
i thought|_|02 the article|_|04 was quite|_|04 sad|_|01 to read|_|10 and disheartening|_|01 to hear|_|02 about the iraqi|_|01 people|_|03 . i felt|_|03 sad|_|01 for them knowing|_|11 their future|_|03 was uncertain|_|02 and how hard|_|11 it was to find|_|01 a job|_|06 . the economy|_|04 they deal|_|02 with is much|_|01 worse|_|01 than ours and i can only imagine|_|02 how difficult|_|02 it must|_|01 be living|_|01 there . i hope|_|02 that it gets|_|01 better|_|12 in the future|_|03 .
it 's really|_|01 amazing|_|01 to me how much|_|01 food|_|03 we waste|_|01 as a country|_|04 considering|_|01 how overweight|_|01 and obese|_|01 people|_|01 are . i ca|_|01 n't believe|_|01 how wasteful|_|03 it all is , if you think|_|10 about it . a lot|_|05 of the food|_|03 we eat|_|06 , we do n't need|_|01 , and then we throw|_|02 away|_|02 so much|_|01 too ! all that food|_|03 belongs|_|01 with people|_|01 who really|_|01 need|_|01 it . i wish|_|02 people|_|01 would donate|_|01 more and that restaurants|_|01 could donate|_|01 their unused|_|04 food|_|03 to homeless|_|02 shelters|_|05 .
i 've heard|_|02 of narcotizing|_|01 fascistic|_|01 before . it 's really|_|01 fucking|_|01 scary|_|01 to think|_|03 that just from a tiny|_|01 little|_|01 cut|_|01 you could get|_|08 a disease|_|01 that has a high|_|07 likelihood|_|01 of killing|_|15 you . there 's also|_|02 a similar|_|04 bacteria|_|01 called|_|02 spenglerian fowler|_|02 that can get|_|08 into your body|_|01 from water|_|02 going|_|16 up your nostrils|_|01 and it basically|_|01 eats|_|01 your brain|_|01 . nature|_|05 is fucking|_|01 metal|_|01 .
i totally|_|01 support|_|09 these protesters|_|03 . we 've had trouble|_|02 with oil|_|01 pipelines|_|02 here in michigan|_|03 . i feel|_|05 like|_|02 these pipelines|_|02 are foisted|_|02 on local|_|03 communities|_|01 without any care|_|02 for whether it is good|_|13 for the community|_|01 and without adequate|_|03 studies|_|01 as to how safe|_|03 they are from leaks|_|05 and pollution|_|01 . there are more important|_|01 things|_|11 in life|_|10 than money|_|03 and oil|_|01 .
this shooting|_|02 is a good|_|13 example|_|07 of how black|_|05 people|_|03 and people|_|03 w|_|02 are wrongly|_|01 prosecuted|_|02 by the police|_|01 . now in this articles|_|01 this gentlemen|_|01 is getting|_|02 a re - trial|_|06 since they concur|_|01 that he did n't do such thing|_|08 and basically|_|01 had the police|_|01 lying|_|05 to the judge|_|01 . now he can be fairly|_|01 be judged|_|02 and not be discriminated|_|03
i feel|_|05 for her . they could’t afford|_|03 to cremate|_|01 them on their own and help|_|01 them , and the financial|_|01 help|_|02 they were entitled|_|02 to as crime|_|01 victims|_|02 had not come|_|04 through because the system|_|08 today|_|01 is n't going|_|03 to help|_|01 criminals|_|01 . i hope|_|03 the government|_|03 now helps|_|01 criminals|_|01 through dangerous|_|01 activities|_|01 and make|_|43 the world|_|01 a better|_|13 place|_|01
so , i had to read|_|06 an article|_|04 about somebody|_|01 named|_|03 kyle jenner|_|01 , and evidently|_|01 she has some sort|_|01 of makeup|_|01 line|_|03 or something . anyway|_|02 , evidently|_|01 she must|_|01 be popular|_|04 for some reason|_|02 , because people|_|03 are making|_|08 counterfeit|_|01 cosmetics|_|01 and selling|_|03 them as her brand|_|02 . she put|_|07 out some message|_|02 about how you should only buy|_|01 direct|_|01 from her website|_|01 . i guess|_|01 a sucker|_|07 is born|_|03 every|_|02 minute|_|02 .
i just read|_|06 about a young|_|01 male|_|01 wolf|_|04 that was shot|_|13 dead|_|01 after walking|_|07 700 miles|_|01 in search|_|05 of a mate|_|03 . that seems|_|04 pretty|_|01 awful|_|02 . i am thinking|_|09 about all of the different|_|03 paths|_|04 that wolf|_|04 walked|_|07 along|_|05 on his|_|01 journey|_|01 , only to see|_|05 it end|_|02 in disaster|_|03 . apparently|_|01 it was a government|_|02 sniper|_|01 that killed|_|01 him . i 'm not sure|_|02 why the government|_|02 has snipers|_|01 to kill|_|01 wolves|_|04 . if they are posing|_|04 a direct|_|01 threat|_|03 , then of course|_|04 animals|_|01 must|_|01 be killed|_|01 , but i do n't see|_|05 that this wolf|_|04 was threatening|_|01 anyway|_|01 . it seems|_|04 dishonorable|_|01 .
can you believe|_|01 what this family|_|02 has done to these girls|_|02 ? they have treated|_|01 these children|_|02 so heinously|_|01 . it is insane|_|01 that the police|_|01 would n't do anything until they were basically|_|01 forced|_|08 by the media|_|02 . i can appreciate|_|01 things|_|08 that happened|_|02 later|_|01 to help|_|01 these girls|_|02 but this so unfair|_|01 . this breaks|_|02 my heart|_|03 .
so today|_|01 i read|_|06 about vaughn , an actor|_|02 i did n't really|_|01 know|_|04 his|_|01 name|_|01 but have watched|_|03 or heard|_|02 most of the shows|_|03 and movies|_|01 he has been in . today|_|01 , i heard|_|02 , he died|_|01 at age|_|01 83|_|01 due|_|03 to leukemia|_|01 . it is very sad|_|01 to lose|_|11 such a well|_|12 respected|_|02 actor|_|02 . i guess|_|02 his|_|01 parents|_|02 divorced|_|02 at a young|_|01 age|_|01 but both gave|_|01 him the genes|_|01 to act|_|02 .
it does seem|_|04 silly|_|03 that people|_|01 in committed|_|01 relationships|_|02 are still|_|01 affected|_|05 by the donating|_|01 ban|_|02 , but i can also|_|02 understand|_|02 why such a ban|_|02 was put|_|02 in place|_|01 . the trouble|_|04 with anything is that when you try|_|01 to protect|_|02 some people|_|01 , others rights|_|01 seem|_|04 to always|_|04 be infringed|_|01 and we 're forced|_|08 to decide|_|03 which offense|_|04 is greater|_|02 and more important|_|01 . i do n't see|_|02 why someone|_|01 ca|_|01 n't be tested|_|01 , found|_|02 to be clean|_|08 and then give|_|05 blood|_|05 but i can understand|_|02 why especially|_|01 in an emergency|_|01 when things|_|08 can easily|_|03 get|_|02 overlooked|_|05 the ban|_|02 is a good|_|01 idea|_|01 .
reading|_|06 this was infuriating|_|01 to me . to see|_|05 such casual|_|01 disregard|_|02 for life|_|03 , both of the animals|_|01 and those protecting|_|02 them , in pursuit|_|02 of money|_|03 . and for what ? snake|_|05 oil|_|01 cures|_|02 in asia|_|02 , superstitious|_|01 nonsense|_|01 , and rich|_|11 people|_|01 wanting|_|01 to feel|_|05 powerful|_|01 . the security|_|03 teams|_|02 seem|_|02 like|_|04 they 're in an impossible|_|01 position|_|01 , restrained|_|03 by rules|_|09 while their opponents|_|04 have none|_|02 . it 's a miserable|_|01 situation|_|02
this is horrifying|_|02 . you 're just going|_|01 about your business|_|07 , then someone|_|01 takes|_|05 issue|_|06 with you , and suddenly|_|01 you 're dead|_|06 . maybe|_|01 you did n't even|_|03 interact|_|01 with them and they just decided|_|01 to kill|_|07 you for fun|_|02 . it 's deeply|_|01 troubling|_|02 and makes|_|02 you suspicious|_|02 of every|_|02 stranger|_|02 on the street|_|05 . i also|_|02 feel|_|05 bad|_|09 for those who had to witness|_|02 this and did n't have time|_|02 to do anything to stop|_|01 it . i 'd imagine|_|02 some feel|_|05 guilty|_|02 even|_|03 though|_|01 they could n't have helped|_|01 .
i have pretty|_|01 strong|_|09 thoughts|_|01 and feelings|_|02 about this . from what i read|_|03 , i feel|_|05 like|_|02 that is a very tragic|_|01 situation|_|03 . us|_|01 as a society|_|02 , we are taking|_|06 advantage|_|01 of the trees|_|03 we have here . in order|_|13 to protect|_|01 the environment|_|01 and make|_|27 the environment|_|01 better|_|13 again , we need|_|01 to take|_|06 care|_|06 of it . what we are doing , in my opinion|_|01 , is morally|_|02 and ethnically|_|01 wrong|_|02 and we need|_|01 to do a better|_|13 job|_|02 of taking|_|06 care|_|06 of nature|_|02 . i understand|_|03 that some blame|_|02 is from the volcanoes|_|02 of hawaii|_|01 , but feel|_|05 like|_|02 us|_|01 humans|_|02 do way|_|05 more damage|_|02 than what mother|_|01 nature|_|02 brings|_|11 .
awful|_|02 news|_|01 article|_|04 . us|_|01 as a society|_|02 need|_|01 to do a better|_|13 job|_|01 of protecting|_|01 and helping|_|01 not only our planet|_|02 , but the animals|_|01 and mammals|_|01 that surround|_|01 it . the fact|_|04 that almost|_|07 100|_|01 percent|_|01 of the caimans|_|01 are suspected|_|03 to be dead|_|06 is alarming|_|02 and people|_|01 should be more informed|_|01 on such matters|_|01 . the rate|_|03 of extinction|_|06 that these animals|_|01 and mammals|_|01 are going|_|01 through on our planet|_|02 is extremely|_|01 alarming|_|02 and i can not figure|_|01 out why people|_|01 are n't more concerned|_|01 or even|_|01 aware|_|01 of the matter|_|01 . we need|_|01 to do a better|_|13 job|_|01 of protecting|_|01 all living|_|01 matter|_|01 on this planet|_|02 , not just ourselves .
we should all try|_|01 to do more to decrease|_|02 global|_|01 warming|_|02 for the sake|_|01 the polar|_|01 bear|_|10 population|_|01 and for our own human|_|02 population|_|01 as well|_|10 . please|_|03 read|_|05 this article|_|04 about the polar|_|01 bears|_|02 and the problems|_|01 they face|_|02 and issues|_|01 that they must|_|01 endure|_|01 related|_|05 to global|_|01 warming|_|02 . the article|_|04 is very descriptive|_|02 and explains|_|02 the issues|_|01 very well|_|10 . it is worth|_|02 reading|_|05 and sharing|_|05 with others to bring|_|11 exposure|_|04 to the plight|_|01 of the polar|_|01 bears|_|02 .
wow|_|02 , how dare|_|01 this person|_|01 hurt|_|04 a poor|_|01 flamingo|_|01 for no reason|_|01 ! ? why would some random|_|01 dude|_|06 go|_|03 to busch gardens|_|03 and abuse|_|03 a bird|_|01 who was minding|_|01 its own business|_|01 ? poor|_|01 bird|_|01 had to be euthanize because of its injuries|_|02 ! the bird|_|01 was 19|_|01 years|_|01 old|_|01 ! it seems|_|03 that there may|_|01 have to be some sort|_|01 of background|_|01 check|_|01 or mental|_|05 health|_|02 testing|_|06 before you are even|_|04 allowed|_|01 to visit|_|01 a place|_|01 like|_|02 this . just unbelievable|_|01 the way|_|11 things|_|05 happen|_|01 ! soot|_|01 sad|_|02 !
oh|_|01 my goodness|_|03 , check|_|06 out this article|_|04 . very interesting|_|01 but also|_|02 very sad|_|02 . poor|_|01 guy|_|03 was just trying|_|01 to do his|_|01 job|_|01 . this sounds|_|01 like|_|02 a terrible|_|02 way|_|01 to die|_|04 . if nothing|_|01 else|_|03 maybe|_|01 some new|_|11 and improved|_|03 safety|_|02 measures|_|01 will be put|_|01 in place|_|01 to protect|_|02 the next|_|01 person|_|01 who has this same recycling|_|02 job|_|01 . i hope|_|03 his|_|01 family|_|01 gets|_|14 an attorney|_|01 and tries|_|01 to get|_|14 some sort|_|03 of money|_|01 for his|_|01 untimely|_|03 death|_|04 .
read|_|06 this article|_|04 , this happened|_|02 in georgia|_|03 where i live|_|05 so i saw|_|01 massive|_|04 amounts|_|01 of news|_|04 coverage|_|03 related|_|05 to this case|_|05 . i personally|_|03 believe|_|01 that the guy|_|03 is guilty|_|02 , there are too many|_|01 things|_|05 that he did and said|_|01 that did not add|_|02 up . it seems|_|04 that he wanted|_|05 to get|_|01 rid|_|01 of his|_|01 kid|_|01 and leave|_|08 his|_|01 wife|_|01 and live|_|05 his|_|01 free|_|03 lifestyle|_|01 . i do not see|_|01 any possible|_|01 way|_|01 that he did not know|_|05 that the kid|_|01 was in the car|_|01 . that poor|_|03 kid|_|01 !
i do n't necessarily|_|03 agree|_|01 with this stance|_|01 , as i feel|_|05 trump|_|02 can help|_|01 our country|_|04 move|_|15 forth|_|01 and improve|_|02 economically|_|03 . while trump|_|02 was n't my ideal|_|02 president|_|02 , he was the much|_|01 better|_|01 choice|_|02 over clinton|_|02 . so , in my opinion|_|02 , he was the better|_|01 candidate|_|02 . i feel|_|05 like|_|04 obama was a joke|_|02 as a president|_|02 , and what did he really|_|01 do during his|_|01 8|_|01 years|_|03 of presidency|_|02 that he will be remembered|_|01 for ? obama care|_|02 ? that is n't a positive|_|02 in my opinion|_|02 . so , i ca|_|01 n't say|_|01 that i really|_|01 think|_|01 moore|_|06 and i are on the same page|_|06 , and we have a difference|_|03 of opinions|_|02 .
as a woman|_|02 myself , i really|_|01 sympathize|_|02 with these women|_|02 . while i find|_|02 it very difficult|_|02 to imagine|_|02 what they go|_|03 through as a woman|_|02 , i can get|_|01 some vague|_|01 idea|_|03 . i would hate|_|01 to think|_|02 that i had to have a male|_|03 escort|_|03 when i left|_|01 my home|_|01 . they are n't treated|_|08 as equals|_|01 , and often|_|03 men|_|01 do n't even|_|01 consider|_|05 them equal|_|01 as their family|_|01 pet|_|01 ! < many|_|01 of the women|_|02 can be abused|_|01 , physically|_|01 and sexually|_|02 , and they are considered|_|05 to be the problem|_|01 , not the abuser|_|01 ! i hope|_|03 they are able|_|01 to win|_|01 by the petition|_|01 , and will be able|_|01 to have a bit|_|04 more freedom|_|01 !
there was a terrible|_|01 bus|_|01 crash|_|02 near|_|01 the town|_|02 where i grew|_|07 up . it looks|_|02 like|_|02 a black|_|04 sedan|_|02 hit|_|15 the bus|_|01 and people|_|01 were hurt|_|06 . apparently|_|01 the injured|_|01 people|_|01 were taken|_|09 to a nearby|_|01 hospital|_|02 where i used|_|01 to work|_|03 . no word|_|07 was released|_|01 on the condition|_|03 of the individuals|_|01 but i sure|_|01 hope|_|03 it was no one|_|02 we know|_|01 or that no one|_|02 is seriously|_|01 hurt|_|06 . please|_|02 say|_|01 a prayer|_|04 for all involved|_|01 and be grateful|_|02 that no lives|_|01 were lost|_|01 .
i do n't know|_|09 much|_|05 about cricket|_|02 but apparently|_|01 in england|_|01 it 's a very big|_|01 deal|_|06 ! this one|_|01 town|_|04 's team|_|02 is under the gun|_|02 to win|_|05 the championship|_|02 and needs|_|02 only 33|_|01 more points|_|24 to pull|_|17 it off . can you imagine|_|02 the pressure|_|01 of the coach|_|04 and players|_|05 ? ? ? that must|_|01 be some fierce|_|01 competition|_|03 over there . i wonder|_|01 if they have as big|_|01 of a fan|_|01 base|_|02 as most of our sports|_|04 do here in the states|_|06 ?
all the unrest|_|02 in the middle|_|04 east|_|05 has me really|_|01 concerned|_|01 with my son|_|02 being deployed|_|02 over there . there 's so much|_|01 going|_|01 on in saudi|_|01 arabia|_|01 and neighboring|_|02 countries|_|01 and i 'm so worried|_|01 he will end|_|01 up right|_|01 in the middle|_|04 of it all . please|_|03 say|_|01 a prayer|_|05 that he is safe|_|02 over there and that nothing|_|01 bad|_|09 happens|_|01 while he is there !
again , i would n't share|_|01 this with anyone ; it 's not that interesting|_|01 to me or to the people|_|03 that i know|_|05 . have you seen|_|11 this article|_|04 about the sudden|_|01 rise|_|02 in tiger|_|02 murders|_|01 by poachers|_|03 ? it 's pretty|_|02 shitty|_|01 that this still|_|04 goes|_|01 on , but what can you do ? people|_|03 are going|_|01 to be horrible|_|03 for all kinds|_|01 of reasons|_|03 and nothing|_|01 is going|_|01 to change|_|06 . what do you think|_|13 about it ? did you think|_|13 that this was an interesting|_|01 article|_|04 ? what 's your thoughts|_|01 ?
i am really|_|01 saddened|_|02 by what is happening|_|04 in brazil|_|01 . i ca|_|01 n't stand|_|04 that this type|_|01 of damage|_|02 is happening|_|04 in nature|_|03 . we as citizens|_|01 of the world|_|01 really|_|01 have to step|_|10 up our efforts|_|01 so that it does n't happen|_|04 more often|_|05 . we should little|_|01 by little|_|01 try|_|01 to reverse|_|05 the damage|_|02 that has been done for better|_|13 good|_|03 .
dude|_|06 i seriously|_|01 can not believe|_|01 what happened|_|04 at the zoo|_|02 not too long|_|02 ago|_|01 . a kid|_|02 fell|_|08 into a moat|_|01 in may|_|01 when he fell|_|08 through the barrier|_|03 . wow|_|01 it must|_|01 have been so terrifying|_|01 for the family|_|02 . then the gorilla|_|01 picked|_|05 up the boy|_|01 and carried|_|02 him a little|_|02 bit|_|04 . they actually|_|02 ended|_|03 up shooting|_|03 the gorilla|_|01 which is so sad|_|02 .
natural|_|04 disasters|_|01 like|_|02 these are just so scary|_|01 . they could literally|_|02 happen|_|02 at anytime and no one|_|02 ever|_|03 knows|_|05 when , especially|_|01 earthquakes|_|02 . it is sad|_|02 to see|_|01 such historic|_|02 buildings|_|07 and areas|_|01 be destroyed|_|02 by this event|_|01 . it is even|_|01 more sad|_|02 knowing|_|01 that people|_|03 got|_|01 injured|_|01 . some things|_|08 just are n't fair|_|01 in life|_|02 and you never|_|01 see|_|01 it coming|_|20 .
this is so unfortunate|_|03 for the family|_|01 of this father|_|01 and son|_|02 . they were probably|_|01 just trying|_|05 to have a nice|_|03 together|_|03 , but did not research|_|01 the area|_|01 well|_|01 enough|_|01 or did not pay|_|07 proper|_|03 attention|_|04 . there are so many|_|01 things|_|01 that could go|_|04 wrong|_|03 , and in this case|_|01 , they all seemed|_|03 to have gone|_|04 wrong|_|03 . i feel|_|12 bad|_|01 for them . the world|_|08 can be pretty|_|01 unforgiving|_|01 .
i feel|_|05 like|_|02 we need|_|03 to do something about this problem|_|01 that is going|_|01 on we font|_|01 need|_|03 moms|_|01 overdosing|_|01 on drugs|_|01 plus|_|02 doing it while they are driving|_|03 . maybe|_|01 there is a program|_|02 we could start|_|08 to help|_|01 these mom|_|01 in need|_|02 and the kids|_|02 that they have should be taken|_|29 care|_|01 by someone|_|01 else|_|03 while they are getting|_|04 the help|_|02 that they need|_|03 to get|_|04 better|_|21 and then they can get|_|04 there kids|_|02 back|_|05 when they are able|_|01 to take|_|29 care|_|01 of them
how could someone|_|01 treat|_|05 such an intelligent|_|04 creature|_|03 so horribly|_|01 . you 'd think|_|12 by now people|_|01 would figure|_|01 out that we do n't have any superior|_|01 right|_|01 to health|_|02 and happiness|_|02 over other animals|_|01 on earth|_|01 . you 'd think|_|12 people|_|01 would be too ashamed|_|01 of the chance|_|02 of getting|_|02 caught|_|24 acting|_|02 like|_|02 this to actually|_|02 have the audacity|_|02 to treat|_|05 another|_|01 living|_|06 creature|_|03 so despicably|_|01 .
hi|_|01 mike|_|01 , i hope|_|02 you are . it 's been hard|_|10 to have these days|_|07 over there when you need|_|01 me here , my friend|_|01 . i hope|_|02 that you are taking|_|01 care|_|03 of all the dangers|_|04 that you are going|_|16 through , that you do it for us|_|01 , for your people|_|03 , your country|_|01 but leaving|_|04 aside|_|02 all that you must|_|01 teach|_|02 in you and your family|_|01 that are waiting|_|04 for you here i hope|_|02 you are well|_|03 and can see|_|12 you soon|_|01 mike|_|01
hello|_|01 brother|_|01 i hope|_|02 you are well|_|13 these days|_|07 and thought|_|09 a lot|_|04 about you and more when i see|_|02 the news|_|01 i find|_|02 out that saudi|_|01 arabia|_|01 is struggling|_|02 to expand|_|01 its territory|_|02 no matter|_|02 what this pad|_|07 should take|_|24 care|_|02 of being there is very dangerous|_|02 so be careful|_|04 i hope|_|02 you take|_|24 care|_|02 of yourself and think|_|09 of us|_|01
man|_|01 veterans|_|03 need|_|01 more help|_|01 . this article|_|04 talks|_|02 about how a lot|_|04 of americans|_|01 have problems|_|01 , especially|_|01 vets|_|02 , with sleeping|_|02 . i can imagine|_|02 that this sleeping|_|02 problem|_|01 can carry|_|21 over into so many|_|01 other areas|_|01 of their lives|_|02 like|_|02 at work|_|02 and their interpersonal|_|01 relationships|_|02 . even|_|01 thought|_|02 they were n't able|_|04 to establish|_|05 a specific|_|02 link|_|01 their has to be a link|_|01 between potsdam|_|01 and problems|_|01 with sleeping|_|02 given|_|18 the huge|_|01 consequences|_|02 of potsdam|_|01 .
getting|_|02 old|_|01 is sad|_|02 . i hope|_|03 they pull|_|17 through . but , many|_|01 people|_|01 never|_|01 reach|_|03 86|_|01 . so , i ca|_|01 n't feel|_|04 too bad|_|09 for them . they also|_|02 probably|_|01 lived|_|05 a life|_|01 many|_|01 of us|_|01 can only dream|_|02 about . this might|_|01 sound|_|02 wrong|_|01 , but i will probably|_|01 forget|_|03 about this in 5|_|01 minutes|_|04 . life|_|01 goes|_|03 on . i 've already|_|01 spent|_|01 more time|_|04 thinking|_|03 about them than they will ever|_|01 think|_|03 about me .
this is a terrible|_|02 story|_|02 , but we ca|_|01 n't go|_|03 so far|_|05 as to blame|_|02 an entire|_|02 religion|_|02 for the actions|_|01 of some . we hope|_|03 what happened|_|03 to paris|_|04 never|_|02 happens|_|03 again , but we simply|_|04 need|_|02 a bit|_|02 more security|_|01 and people|_|01 with their eyes|_|05 open|_|09 - not attitudes|_|01 against an entire|_|02 religion|_|02 or people|_|01 . consider|_|01 these unfortunate|_|03 ways|_|11 of rallying|_|02 countries|_|01 behind|_|01 one|_|01 cause|_|02 of peace|_|04 .
this is a nice|_|01 story|_|03 - people|_|01 have some level|_|02 of need|_|02 to protect|_|02 nature|_|05 and protecting|_|02 birds|_|01 is an excellent|_|01 way|_|11 of giving|_|18 back|_|04 , especially|_|01 since some are endangered|_|02 . i have to commend|_|03 this person|_|01 for trying|_|01 really|_|01 hard|_|01 to protect|_|02 one|_|05 species|_|01 , and for committing|_|18 to it . i myself would have a difficult|_|01 time|_|06 choosing|_|03 what to gel|_|01 pith|_|03 - but this person|_|01 does n't !
i just do n't understand|_|02 how this is the country|_|04 that we all say|_|01 we love|_|01 and adore|_|01 , but yet|_|04 when others come|_|04 here there are so many|_|01 stipulations|_|02 for them , and then even|_|03 when they succeed|_|02 at jumping|_|11 through all of the hoops|_|02 they are forced|_|02 to , they have even|_|03 more guidelines|_|01 behind|_|01 that . it 's just so unfortunate|_|03 that these refugees|_|01 will feel|_|05 unsafe|_|04 and ultimately|_|01 feel|_|05 like|_|02 refugees|_|01 for the rest|_|07 of their lives|_|03 .
these are the headlines|_|01 that i have to read|_|06 these days|_|07 ! i just ca|_|01 n't believe|_|01 all of the horrid|_|01 news|_|04 that is taking|_|01 over our lives|_|10 lately|_|01 . and now we have to worry|_|06 about when our men|_|01 and women|_|02 go|_|01 out to train|_|01 , that this kind|_|01 of thing|_|08 can end|_|04 of happening|_|01 at the drop|_|08 of a hat|_|02 . so , who is responsible|_|02 after this ? who helps|_|01 the children|_|04 now without parents|_|01 ? who pays|_|09 for everything surrounding|_|01 their funerals|_|01 , and all of the costs|_|03 after that ?
the wildlife|_|01 park|_|06 offers|_|02 their help|_|02 after over half|_|01 a million|_|01 supporters|_|01 signed|_|07 a petition|_|01 made|_|35 by the non|_|01 - profit|_|02 organization|_|02 animals|_|01 asia|_|01 to demand|_|01 the closure|_|05 of the aquarium|_|01 . if the current|_|01 owners|_|02 of the polar|_|02 bear|_|02 agree|_|01 to this offer|_|09 , pizza|_|01 could be moved|_|01 to a proper|_|04 sanctuary|_|01 and his|_|01 life|_|01 of misery|_|01 would end|_|04 . “ the good|_|01 news|_|01 now for grand|_|01 view|_|02 is that they now have the chance|_|01 to put|_|01 their mistake|_|02 right|_|06 , ” dave neal , animal|_|01 welfare|_|01 director|_|01 for animals|_|01 asia|_|01 , said|_|01 in a statement|_|04 . “ thanks|_|02 to this incredible|_|01 offer|_|09 from yorkshire|_|01 wildlife|_|01 park|_|06 there can be a happy|_|02 ending|_|04 and the negative|_|01 publicity|_|02 they have suffered|_|03 can yet|_|01 be turned|_|18 into a positive|_|01 news|_|01 story|_|03 . from talking|_|02 to them i know|_|10 they know|_|10 that mistakes|_|02 have been made|_|35 in terms|_|03 of their animal|_|01 facilities|_|05 and on - going|_|01 care|_|06 . ” china|_|01 ’s

a gut|_|01 feeling|_|01 , or gut|_|01 reaction|_|07 , is a visceral|_|02 emotional|_|01 reaction|_|07 to something . it may|_|01 be negative|_|01 , such as a feeling|_|01 of uneasiness|_|01 , or positive|_|01 , such as a feeling|_|01 of trust|_|01 . gut|_|01 feelings|_|01 are generally|_|01 regarded|_|05 as not modulated|_|02 by conscious|_|03 thought|_|01 , but sometimes|_|01 as a feature|_|01 of intuition|_|02 rather|_|01 than rationality|_|01 .

www|_|01 , this story|_|02 is so heartbreaking|_|02 . i ca|_|01 n't imagine|_|02 what this family|_|01 is going|_|03 through . did you see|_|01 this ? i am hopeful|_|01 that they can find|_|05 peace|_|05 . if something like|_|02 this happened|_|03 to me , i do not know|_|05 what i would do . i guess|_|02 that this just reminds|_|03 us|_|01 that life|_|06 is precious|_|02 and we should appreciate|_|01 what we have !
please|_|03 hug|_|02 your loved|_|02 ones|_|01 because they may|_|01 be gone|_|03 at any moments|_|02 of time|_|04 . if you were in an argument|_|03 with any of them please|_|03 reconsider|_|02 what has happened|_|01 in the past|_|01 and let|_|02 it go|_|03 . life|_|06 is short|_|06 and we all have only one|_|05 life|_|06 to live|_|01 on this planet|_|02 . we should all cherish|_|02 each other and enjoy|_|04 life|_|06 to the fullest|_|01 .
we should cherish|_|02 all the works|_|05 that the police|_|01 force|_|04 offers|_|02 to us|_|01 each and every|_|02 day|_|01 . while we sleep|_|02 at night|_|07 , police|_|01 officers|_|01 patrol|_|01 up and down our streets|_|05 and neighborhoods|_|04 making|_|01 sure|_|02 that we are safe|_|04 and sound|_|04 . we may|_|01 fear|_|03 police|_|01 officers|_|01 when we see|_|08 them but fear|_|03 not because they serve|_|10 the country|_|01 as our law|_|01 and enforcement|_|01 .
this is very sad|_|02 . i can only imagine|_|02 how stressful|_|01 it must|_|01 be for the people|_|03 living|_|05 in the areas|_|01 threatened|_|03 by these fires|_|02 . it must|_|01 be so stressful|_|01 knowing|_|01 that you have to be ready|_|01 to evacuate|_|03 any minute|_|04 and leaving|_|04 your home|_|01 and all your belongings|_|01 behind|_|01 to possibly|_|01 never|_|01 seeing|_|01 them again . i also|_|02 feel|_|12 bad|_|01 for all the wildlife|_|01 .
i had never|_|01 heard|_|04 of people|_|01 shaming|_|03 women|_|02 who give|_|01 birth|_|05 by c|_|01 section|_|04 . this is one|_|01 of the dumbest|_|04 things|_|12 i 've ever|_|01 heard|_|04 . i 'm sure|_|07 the majority|_|03 of c|_|01 sections|_|04 are medically|_|01 required|_|02 to help|_|01 the mother|_|01 and the baby|_|03 , not because women|_|02 are just so eager|_|01 to undergo|_|01 major|_|04 surgery|_|06 . why do people|_|01 even|_|04 care|_|02 if someone|_|01 gave|_|01 birth|_|05 by c|_|01 section|_|04 instead|_|01 of natural|_|06 birth|_|05 anyway|_|02 .
this is such a sad|_|02 situation|_|03 for both the people|_|01 and the elephants|_|02 affected|_|05 by all the coal|_|01 mining|_|01 . the world|_|08 really|_|01 needs|_|02 to move|_|01 forward|_|03 to try|_|01 to replace|_|01 using|_|06 coal|_|01 as a means|_|01 of energy|_|04 , and replace|_|01 it with something that is less|_|01 harmful|_|01 to humans|_|02 , animals|_|01 and the environment|_|02 . it 's not fair|_|10 , especially|_|01 to the animals|_|01 , since they do n't really|_|01 benefit|_|01 from the coal|_|01 mining|_|01 .
we definitely|_|01 need|_|02 to make|_|02 sure|_|07 we step|_|10 up our efforts|_|01 to vet|_|02 who we let|_|01 in this country|_|01 , especially|_|01 as far|_|05 as refugees|_|01 go|_|01 . just like|_|02 you would n't leave|_|01 your door|_|01 open|_|14 and invite|_|05 intruders|_|01 , we should not let|_|01 refugees|_|01 into our country|_|01 without vetting|_|02 them . we do n't know|_|04 if they 're part|_|10 of isis|_|01 or not . it may|_|01 seem|_|02 like|_|02 racial|_|02 profiling|_|02 , but only middle|_|02 easterners|_|01 belong|_|01 to isis|_|01 , so it is appropriate|_|01 in this case|_|02 .
trump|_|02 should really|_|01 not underestimate|_|01 the blacks|_|05 . they got|_|01 complacent|_|01 after two|_|01 obama terms|_|03 , and did n't come|_|04 out in force|_|01 like|_|02 they should have for the election|_|01 . now that trump|_|02 is in office|_|01 , i do n't think|_|10 there 's any way|_|11 he can win|_|01 the black|_|06 vote|_|04 , and that would definitely|_|01 sway|_|23 the election|_|01 in 2020 . i really|_|01 think|_|10 trump|_|02 's days|_|01 are numbered|_|01 , whether it 's impeachment|_|01 or defeat|_|01 in the next|_|02 election|_|01 .
did you hear|_|02 about what had happened|_|03 to the kid|_|01 in china|_|01 . they found|_|05 his|_|01 body|_|03 dead|_|06 in a deserted|_|03 well|_|07 in china|_|01 after he was helping|_|01 his|_|01 father|_|06 pick|_|01 some vegetables|_|02 or something like|_|02 that . i just feel|_|05 like|_|02 if he was helping|_|01 his|_|01 father|_|06 , then it is hard|_|01 to believe|_|01 that his|_|01 dad|_|01 did not know|_|07 he had fallen|_|05 into the well|_|05 . either|_|01 way|_|01 , sad|_|02 story|_|01 .
so apparently|_|01 there is an infamous|_|01 retired|_|01 nba star|_|05 who is going|_|02 around|_|04 and pieing|_|01 influential|_|01 political|_|01 figures|_|01 aha . at first|_|01 i thought|_|02 it was a typo|_|01 , and it was suppose|_|01 to be die|_|03 , but it indeed|_|02 was talking|_|02 about someone|_|01 taking|_|41 a coconut|_|03 pie|_|01 , and slamming|_|01 it into the face|_|05 of people|_|01 . the act|_|02 seems|_|02 pretty|_|02 innocent|_|01 to me , and is almost|_|07 sad|_|01 that he is going|_|02 to have to face|_|01 some jail|_|01 time|_|04 along|_|04 with the beating|_|02 from the security|_|02 . obviously|_|01 , you ca|_|01 nt|_|01 go|_|02 around|_|04 doing this , but it is tough|_|01 not to laugh|_|02 .
this day|_|01 and age|_|01 , there is a tremendous|_|01 amount|_|01 of evidence|_|03 showing|_|01 that climate|_|02 change|_|05 is real|_|01 . in this new|_|12 reality|_|04 , how will life|_|13 react|_|01 . do species|_|01 have the ability|_|02 to adapt|_|03 and thrive|_|02 in new|_|12 clients|_|08 or will they disappear|_|02 . what will happen|_|04 to humans|_|02 as well|_|03 ? more studies|_|01 need|_|02 to be done in order|_|01 to figure|_|01 out not if we can stop|_|04 climate|_|02 change|_|05 , but how will it affect|_|01 us|_|01 all .
obesity|_|01 is an epidemic|_|01 in today|_|02 's society|_|02 . almost|_|07 one|_|06 in three|_|02 people|_|01 are obese|_|01 . sometimes|_|01 i wonder|_|03 how we got|_|07 here . people|_|02 these days|_|01 take|_|08 no responsibility|_|02 for themselves and their actions|_|01 . the cost|_|03 of care|_|05 has increased|_|02 tremendously|_|01 from the obesity|_|01 epidemic|_|01 in this country|_|04 . according|_|01 to the most current|_|01 statistics|_|01 , over fifteen|_|01 million|_|01 americans|_|03 can be classified|_|04 as extremely|_|01 obese|_|01 .
not a surprise|_|03 to see|_|01 the united|_|01 states|_|04 falling|_|03 further|_|04 down in the global|_|01 rankings|_|01 in yet|_|01 another|_|01 category|_|02 . i think|_|01 by the time|_|02 our next|_|03 presidential|_|02 election|_|04 comes|_|04 around|_|07 we will be no longer|_|01 be considered|_|01 a destination|_|04 country|_|04 but anyone in the know|_|01 . i do n't see|_|01 why this particular|_|02 stat is n't a matter|_|02 of culture|_|02 though|_|01 . i have n't met|_|01 many|_|01 women|_|02 who expressed|_|05 an interest|_|01 in stem|_|01 and most of them did n't even|_|03 want|_|05 to talk|_|02 to people|_|01 who were into it when i was in college|_|03 . now women|_|02 might|_|01 be more interested|_|01 but it still|_|01 is n't going|_|03 to be anything approaching|_|04 equal|_|01 because the culture|_|02 does n't work|_|27 that way|_|11 .
" in spain|_|01 this was the deadly|_|03 train|_|01 crash|_|04 killed|_|01 at least|_|01 four|_|01 people|_|01 and injured|_|01 nearly|_|07 50|_|01 others after it derailed|_|02 in the northwest|_|01 region|_|01 of the country|_|02 . photos|_|01 of the wreck|_|02 showed|_|08 the train|_|01 ’s carriage|_|04 flipped|_|01 on its side|_|01 and smashed|_|07 from where it likely|_|01 hit|_|03 part|_|01 of a bridge|_|07 near|_|02 the tracks|_|11 . a witness|_|01 woman|_|01 told|_|07 spanish|_|01 television|_|01 about hearing|_|02 a " " very strong|_|09 bang|_|03 " " before seeing|_|03 billowing|_|01 black|_|05 smoke|_|02 . "
remember|_|07 when i told|_|01 you i had ringing|_|01 in my ear|_|04 sometimes|_|01 ? this article|_|04 seems|_|03 to parallel|_|01 what i was talking|_|05 about . can you look|_|02 into this further ? i really|_|01 trust|_|01 your viewpoint|_|01 on this . i am going|_|01 to ask|_|01 my doctor|_|01 about this later|_|01 on this week|_|01 . i do not want|_|05 this to get|_|01 worse|_|01 . maybe|_|01 you can advise|_|02 on a good|_|15 doctor|_|01 i can see|_|02 regarding|_|05 this ? i am just really|_|01 worried|_|01 about it . thanks|_|02 again man|_|08 !
the flint|_|03 , michigan|_|01 water|_|03 crisis|_|02 is out of control|_|02 . it seems|_|04 like|_|02 there is n't much|_|01 being done to help|_|01 them get|_|03 cleaner|_|15 water|_|03 . we need|_|02 to do everything we can to help|_|01 them . children|_|03 are being hospitalized|_|01 because of the cities|_|02 incompetence|_|02 . no one|_|01 should have to go|_|01 without clean|_|15 water|_|03 , and because we live|_|01 in the united|_|01 states|_|01 , it 's especially|_|01 true|_|12 .
i 'm sorry|_|01 .... i do n't mean|_|04 to laugh|_|01 ... but ..... this was too much|_|01 . i hate|_|01 to admit|_|08 that i found|_|05 it a little|_|02 bit|_|04 funny|_|02 , but at the same time|_|04 , i feel|_|05 sorry|_|01 that this man|_|08 was this ignorant|_|01 to do this to himself . now he 's going|_|03 to have to go|_|03 through so much|_|01 more stuff|_|05 , when in all likeliness|_|01 , a simple|_|01 urine|_|01 test|_|02 probably|_|01 would have been performed|_|01 to find|_|05 a solution|_|02 to the issue|_|02 to begin|_|09 with .
i just read|_|03 the article|_|02 and i am so surprised|_|01 that this happened|_|01 . i feel|_|05 really|_|01 embarrassed|_|01 for her because it seems|_|02 obvious|_|01 that she 's the one|_|06 starting|_|10 trouble|_|02 but i worry|_|03 that she might|_|01 have some sort|_|01 of mental|_|05 illness|_|01 or disorder|_|01 that she really|_|01 did n't realize|_|02 what she said|_|11 and that makes|_|43 me feel|_|05 bad|_|01 for her . i can understand|_|03 her concerns|_|04 about racism|_|02 but i think|_|03 that she 's just not very credible|_|03 in this case|_|05 . i just feel|_|05 like|_|02 we need|_|03 to be really|_|01 sensitive|_|02 towards racism|_|02 and keep|_|02 an open|_|05 mind|_|01 when it happens|_|01 , but considering|_|01 that there were other people|_|01 there and absolutely|_|02 no one|_|02 is backing|_|01 her up , i do n't know|_|05 if we can really|_|01 take|_|01 her seriously|_|01 and that 's really|_|01 sad|_|02 . crow|_|03 also|_|02 does n't seem|_|02 like|_|02 the kind|_|01 of person|_|01 to be racist|_|01 or to bully|_|02 someone|_|01 for absolutely|_|02 no reason|_|03 , either|_|01 .
i always|_|04 feel|_|13 bad|_|01 when women|_|02 talk|_|03 about their experiences|_|03 with sexual|_|04 assault|_|03 because you know|_|01 how i feel|_|13 about that but i want|_|01 to put|_|04 it into words|_|02 anyway|_|01 . i feel|_|13 like|_|01 it 's always|_|04 on the women|_|02 to be the ones|_|02 to hold|_|05 men|_|01 accountable|_|01 and to report|_|04 it and everything but i 'm so frustrated|_|02 by the fact|_|03 that men|_|01 wo n't take|_|05 a bigger|_|01 stand|_|12 . men|_|01 should hold|_|05 each other accountable|_|01 for sexual|_|04 assault|_|03 and encourage|_|03 each other not to do it instead|_|01 of making|_|02 jokes|_|04 about it all the time|_|06 . i 'm just so frustrated|_|02 by how there are so many|_|01 stories|_|03 of women|_|02 that are suffering|_|03 needlessly|_|01 at the hands|_|06 of these arrogant|_|01 men|_|01 and yet|_|01 women|_|02 have to endure|_|03 a lifetime|_|05 of trauma|_|02 from it and men|_|01 usually|_|01 get|_|03 away|_|01 with a slap|_|06 on the wrist|_|01 , it really|_|01 just makes|_|02 me so sick|_|01 to my stomach|_|03 , i hate|_|01 it so much|_|04 .
it 's almost|_|07 funny|_|02 because i was looking|_|09 at something really|_|01 similar|_|03 to this on steve wilkes|_|02 , that a baby|_|01 got|_|02 hurt|_|06 after pushing|_|11 through a window|_|08 screen|_|01 and steve was yelling|_|02 at her and saying|_|01 how she was so negligent|_|01 and a bad|_|01 mom|_|01 but i honestly|_|01 think|_|02 that it 's not the parents|_|02 fault|_|06 . sometimes|_|01 accidents|_|02 just really|_|01 so happen|_|03 and kids|_|02 are curious|_|01 and they climb|_|01 and then accidents|_|02 happen|_|03 . it 's really|_|01 upsetting|_|01 for all of those involved|_|01 and i really|_|01 feel|_|05 for the mom|_|01 in this case|_|01 because she just lost|_|11 her kid|_|02 and she probably|_|01 blames|_|03 herself enough|_|01 as it is . she does n't need|_|03 society|_|02 talking|_|03 badly|_|06 about her from behind|_|03 closed|_|15 doors|_|01 . accidents|_|02 are just accidents|_|02 and it can happen|_|03 to anyone , although i think|_|02 that everyone can agree|_|01 that it 's a really|_|01 sad|_|02 situation|_|03 overall|_|02 .
hey buddy|_|01 . did you hear|_|02 about this weird|_|01 disease|_|01 that is spreading|_|02 among st the frog|_|01 population|_|04 ? apparently|_|01 it 's a disease|_|01 that happens|_|04 due|_|02 to people|_|01 having ponds|_|01 in their house|_|01 . i worry|_|06 what this disease|_|01 could do to the local|_|03 population|_|04 of frogs|_|03 . tell|_|01 anyone who has a pond|_|01 to be careful|_|05 with what they are moving|_|01 in and out of their ponds|_|01 .
i thought|_|10 reading|_|03 an article|_|01 about iconic|_|01 moments|_|02 of women|_|02 athletes|_|01 would be quite|_|04 a bit|_|10 more interesting|_|01 and moving|_|01 than it was . instead|_|01 , it was mostly|_|01 a rattling|_|03 of championships|_|02 and medal|_|02 counts|_|03 with very few anecdotal|_|01 pieces|_|06 of information|_|05 . the only things|_|12 that really|_|01 stood|_|12 out were the story|_|02 of the marathon|_|03 runner|_|06 and the swimmer|_|01 because there were interesting|_|01 stories|_|02 attached|_|01 to them .
it 's very unfortunate|_|03 for both the wildlife|_|01 and the communities|_|01 that survive|_|01 off of the meat|_|01 that the rare|_|06 animals|_|01 provide|_|06 . it 's also|_|02 sad|_|02 how the police|_|01 officers|_|01 ran|_|01 away|_|01 which was i guess|_|02 the main|_|03 point|_|09 of the person|_|01 telling|_|05 the story|_|01 . that is very corrupt|_|02 and wrong|_|05 , they should have stood|_|12 up for the rangers|_|01 being targeted|_|01 . i think|_|02 it 's best|_|02 if the wildlife|_|01 is preserved|_|04 and the community|_|01 that attacked|_|06 the rangers|_|01 were clearly|_|01 out of line|_|02 .
hey , i thought|_|05 this was an interesting|_|01 article|_|04 about males|_|02 born|_|03 through medical|_|02 fertilization|_|01 . apparently|_|01 , these men|_|01 are also|_|02 more likely|_|01 to suffer|_|11 from the same problems|_|01 as their fathers|_|01 did with being able|_|04 to have babies|_|05 . it 's sort|_|04 of sad|_|02 to think|_|05 about it . the author|_|01 suggest|_|05 using|_|01 a sperm|_|01 donor|_|02 instead|_|01 , but i could n't imagine|_|02 doing that if i was in this situation|_|03 .
hey , check|_|01 this out . this guy|_|03 ended|_|02 up murdering|_|01 his|_|01 wife|_|01 for no obvious|_|01 ad|_|01 apparent|_|01 reason|_|06 , according|_|01 to this article|_|04 . he was happily|_|02 married|_|02 to his|_|01 wife|_|01 and just ended|_|02 up committing|_|01 a homicide|_|01 . it 's scary|_|01 to think|_|09 about , how it could be possible|_|01 for someone|_|01 to just go|_|01 off like|_|02 that and kill|_|01 someone|_|01 they love|_|02 .
this article|_|02 i just read|_|06 talks|_|01 about another|_|01 mass|_|03 shooter|_|02 . well|_|04 , not so much|_|01 mass|_|03 shooter|_|02 like|_|02 some of the recent|_|01 ones|_|02 , but they did open|_|12 fire|_|09 in public|_|01 and kill|_|07 5|_|01 people|_|03 . i ca|_|01 n't help|_|01 but feel|_|05 disgusted|_|02 that these things|_|11 still|_|04 happen|_|04 . i really|_|01 hope|_|02 that this guy|_|03 gets|_|01 what he deserves|_|01 , because this has to stop|_|03 .
" ugh - can you believe|_|01 this story|_|02 ? first|_|02 - why not just go|_|03 to the doctor|_|01 ? do n't be shy|_|03 , it 's your dick|_|01 we 're talking|_|02 about . then , why insert|_|01 a chopstick|_|01 so far|_|01 that you could""t get|_|21 it out . holy|_|01 crap|_|01 , that sounds|_|02 awful|_|01 . i am totally|_|01 shocked|_|01 to read|_|06 this and can only imagine|_|02 the pain|_|04 - but then again , he did bring|_|04 it upon himself . "
did you see|_|05 that leonard|_|01 cohen passed|_|01 away|_|01 ? you know|_|01 , the guy|_|03 who made|_|43 the hallelujah|_|01 song|_|01 . poor|_|01 guy|_|03 passed|_|01 away|_|01 after suffering|_|02 an injury|_|02 but from what i hear|_|02 he passed|_|01 away|_|01 in his|_|01 sleep|_|01 and he did n't suffer|_|02 at all which is really|_|01 good|_|01 . it really|_|01 makes|_|43 you think|_|03 that if he would of went|_|15 to the hospital|_|02 he might|_|01 actually|_|04 still|_|04 be alive|_|01 . just make|_|43 sure|_|02 you get|_|01 yourself checked|_|10 if you ever|_|03 hurt|_|02 yourself .
did you see|_|01 what is going|_|01 on with all those refugees|_|01 ? they are trying|_|01 to cross|_|05 over by water|_|06 and a lot|_|05 of them are drowning|_|03 and there are record|_|01 numbers|_|01 for deaths|_|05 from shipwrecks|_|03 . those poor|_|03 people|_|01 just want|_|01 to get|_|14 away|_|01 and lead|_|03 a better|_|21 life|_|05 and they all keep|_|02 dying|_|01 or continue|_|02 to suffer|_|10 . i really|_|01 wish|_|02 we could do something for them so they could all live|_|07 better|_|21 lives|_|05 .
wow|_|02 - this is so so horrible|_|03 ! i ca|_|01 n't even|_|03 begin|_|09 to understand|_|02 why syria|_|01 would attack|_|05 its own citizens|_|01 , and why would russia|_|01 support|_|02 them in doing so ? this is a sick|_|06 regime|_|01 and i am glad|_|03 that america|_|01 and its allies|_|02 are interfering|_|01 . the fact|_|02 that they are denying|_|03 doing it is truly|_|01 messed|_|02 up . i hope|_|03 these poor|_|01 children|_|02 who survived|_|02 are able|_|02 to get|_|07 the health|_|02 care|_|02 they so desperately|_|01 deserved|_|01 . could you guys|_|02 imagine|_|02 if this was happening|_|04 here ? ?
let|_|01 's be real|_|02 for a second|_|02 - politics|_|05 is and always|_|04 has been a cruel|_|01 and nasty|_|02 game|_|10 . these politicians|_|02 throw|_|08 insults|_|02 at each other for months|_|02 in order|_|02 to win|_|01 . that 's what competition|_|01 portrays|_|04 itself as in politics|_|05 . for this woman|_|02 to suddenly|_|01 become|_|04 offended|_|02 when she has thrown|_|08 around|_|01 plenty|_|02 of insults|_|02 herself is not just hypocritical|_|01 , but also|_|02 shows|_|08 a lot|_|02 of weakness|_|03 on her part|_|09 . i do n't like|_|02 her policies|_|01 anyways|_|01 !
i really|_|01 feel|_|05 bad|_|01 for turkey|_|02 . i think|_|01 they are trying|_|01 to do everything they can to get|_|02 rid|_|01 of terrorism|_|01 in the country|_|04 . it seems|_|02 that their efforts|_|02 are for naught|_|01 . they want|_|01 to keep|_|02 the people|_|01 safe|_|02 and yet|_|01 more terrorist|_|01 groups|_|01 keep|_|02 popping|_|02 up . then the lawmakers|_|01 are involved|_|05 and there is only so much|_|01 you can do . turkey|_|02 is constantly|_|02 at war|_|04 . i 'm wondering|_|01 if this will end|_|02 up with the us|_|01 trying|_|01 to do something over there or bringing|_|04 that trouble|_|02 here . it is upsetting|_|01 really|_|01 to hear|_|02 about all this going|_|02 on in the world|_|08 when people|_|01 just want|_|01 peace|_|01 . there is always|_|02 terrorism|_|01 and someone|_|01 trying|_|01 to bring|_|04 down a country|_|04 , but the country|_|04 tries|_|01 its hardest|_|01 to fight|_|06 back|_|06 despite|_|02 opposition|_|01 .
the article|_|04 that i just read|_|03 was about the ongoing|_|01 violence|_|03 and fighting|_|03 between kenya|_|01 and south|_|05 sudan|_|02 . the words|_|02 in the article|_|04 really|_|01 struck|_|13 a nerve|_|03 with me . it made|_|08 me cry|_|01 . there have been thousands|_|01 of people|_|01 who have lost|_|07 their lives|_|13 during this argument|_|01 . it makes|_|08 me want|_|02 to reach|_|01 out and help|_|05 in any way|_|05 possible|_|01 . the fighting|_|03 needs|_|02 to stop|_|01 and peace|_|05 needs|_|02 to be restored|_|05 between these two|_|01 nations|_|04 .
so i just read|_|05 an article|_|04 where 2|_|01 friends|_|05 went|_|01 diving|_|01 to a place|_|01 they should n't have and ended|_|01 up dying|_|04 . while they were using|_|04 brand|_|02 new|_|01 equipment|_|01 , i feel|_|05 like|_|02 idiots|_|01 who take|_|01 stupid|_|01 risks|_|04 and go|_|01 to places|_|01 where no humans|_|02 should be , kind|_|01 of deserve|_|01 what ends|_|01 up happening|_|01 to them . if you font|_|01 sky|_|01 dive|_|01 , you never|_|02 have to worry|_|06 about going|_|01 splat|_|02 when your chute|_|01 does n't open|_|09
so when i was a kid|_|01 , the big|_|01 thing|_|12 i used|_|01 to remember|_|03 was reading|_|03 about the poachers|_|01 in africa|_|01 grinding|_|02 down animal|_|01 parts|_|01 to then put|_|04 into powder|_|01 for men|_|01 to snort|_|02 to work|_|02 like|_|02 viagra|_|01 . today|_|02 apparently|_|01 those guys|_|03 are going|_|02 even|_|03 further|_|05 . they are hunting|_|07 everything and anything just to make|_|03 a profit|_|01 . not a surprise|_|03
this is probably|_|01 one|_|06 of the most distressing|_|01 articles|_|02 i have read|_|03 in my entire|_|02 life|_|11 , i really|_|01 do not understand|_|03 how this is even|_|04 happening|_|04 . over and over again , we are showing|_|10 to the black|_|12 people|_|01 in our country|_|01 that we do not have the heart|_|10 or the brains|_|01 to care|_|01 about them enough|_|01 . it just makes|_|43 me so mad|_|02 !
three|_|01 quarters|_|06 of a year|_|03 after the erika outbreak|_|01 was declared|_|08 a global|_|01 health|_|02 emergency|_|02 , the virus|_|03 has infected|_|04 almost|_|07 seven|_|01 hundred|_|01 thousand|_|01 men|_|01 and women|_|02 across|_|02 latin|_|03 america|_|01 . one|_|01 estimate|_|05 in the tens|_|01 of thousands|_|01 represents|_|01 the number|_|04 of infected|_|04 expecting|_|01 mothers|_|01 . this is feared|_|04 to result|_|03 in fetal|_|01 deformities|_|01 .
it would appear|_|02 to me , in my opinion|_|02 , the liberal|_|08 , nonsensical|_|01 , mainstream|_|01 media|_|01 is at it again . let|_|01 's use|_|07 fear|_|03 - mongering|_|01 and misinformation|_|01 to stir|_|03 up a demographic|_|01 in our all out effort|_|02 against donald trump|_|02 . i feel|_|05 for those who do n't read|_|03 the actual|_|05 proposals|_|03 and/or legislation|_|02 but instead|_|01 decide|_|04 to believe|_|01 every|_|01 word|_|07 uttered|_|02 by the talking|_|02 head|_|01 on tv|_|01 .
" hey everyone , please|_|02 share|_|02 this ! she appears|_|02 to be in her late|_|06 60s|_|01 or early|_|01 70s|_|01 , 6'0 " " , 175lbs , with gray|_|04 hair|_|01 . this could easily|_|03 be someone|_|01 's grandmother|_|01 or mom|_|01 , a family|_|08 could be worried|_|06 sick|_|02 about her . her outfit|_|01 sounds|_|02 like|_|02 she may|_|01 of been in some sort|_|03 of retirement|_|03 home|_|07 or something similar|_|01 . i know|_|01 if this was my grandmother|_|01 i could want|_|01 to know|_|01 so i could help|_|01 her get|_|01 home|_|07 , so please|_|02 share|_|02 this within|_|02 the area|_|06 so we can maybe|_|01 get|_|04 her back|_|03 to her home|_|07 and family|_|08 . "
i hate|_|01 that tourism|_|01 and economy|_|04 end|_|04 up hurting|_|06 our animal|_|01 's habitats|_|01 ! people|_|01 are so selfish|_|01 while traveling|_|03 , and they do not think|_|01 of how their actions|_|01 will effect|_|02 the wildlife|_|01 in the area|_|01 . please|_|03 remember|_|07 to clean|_|04 up your trash|_|02 , do not litter|_|03 , and do not leave|_|06 items|_|01 out that will potentially|_|01 hurt|_|06 animals|_|01 when you are visiting|_|07 an area|_|01 . countries|_|01 need|_|02 to spend|_|02 more time|_|06 and effort|_|02 on saving|_|06 natural|_|09 areas|_|01 for wildlife|_|01 .
michael|_|01 bible|_|02 's three|_|02 year|_|01 old|_|03 son|_|02 has cancer|_|05 . this is so horrible|_|03 and sad|_|02 . i ca|_|01 n't imagine|_|02 what they are feeling|_|05 right|_|01 now . my uncle|_|02 died|_|01 of prostate|_|01 cancer|_|05 and i know|_|05 nothing|_|01 will ever|_|01 be the same . cancer|_|05 on such a young|_|01 boy|_|01 seems|_|04 so cruel|_|01 if there is a god|_|03 out there . i am really|_|01 hoping|_|06 their son|_|02 pulls|_|01 through and they keep|_|04 on fighting|_|03 together|_|03 as a family|_|01 .
did you hear|_|02 about the polar|_|03 bear|_|02 name|_|01 pizza|_|01 called|_|20 the word|_|04 's saddest|_|02 polar|_|03 bear|_|02 ? apparently|_|01 they are not treating|_|05 it well|_|13 in china|_|01 by not giving|_|41 it enough|_|02 space|_|07 and turning|_|01 his|_|01 life|_|01 into a circus|_|02 show|_|01 . he started|_|06 to inflict|_|01 self|_|02 harm|_|01 because of his|_|01 living|_|01 condition|_|05 . i really|_|01 hope|_|02 china|_|01 comes|_|13 up with better|_|02 animal|_|01 cruelty|_|03 laws|_|01 although i doubt|_|02 this will happen|_|04 because of our culture|_|02 difference|_|03 . it makes|_|03 me furious|_|02 knowing|_|07 animals|_|01 are being treated|_|05 like|_|02 this over there .
i am very concerned|_|01 about our staple|_|01 crops|_|05 that we use|_|04 to survive|_|01 off of . the climate|_|02 change|_|01 is likely|_|01 going|_|01 to kill|_|02 off our crops|_|05 . we are already|_|01 seeing|_|01 signs|_|01 , and it does n't look|_|02 good|_|13 . the university|_|03 in arizona|_|02 is already|_|01 seeing|_|01 this , and no one|_|01 is listening|_|02 . only a few news|_|01 channels|_|07 are spreading|_|01 the news|_|01 . this is going|_|01 to affect|_|02 those non|_|01 technological|_|01 countries|_|02 first|_|01 , which is a shame|_|02 since none|_|02 of this is their fault|_|04 .
i just can not even|_|03 imagine|_|02 something like|_|02 that happening|_|03 . what makes|_|08 someone|_|01 do such a horrible|_|03 thing|_|05 ? and especially|_|01 when there were children|_|03 on board|_|01 ? such a senseless|_|01 act|_|02 . how scared|_|10 those individuals|_|01 and the victim|_|02 must|_|01 have been when that was happening|_|03 . it is a good|_|01 thing|_|05 that that guy|_|03 was there to help|_|01 the passengers|_|01 get|_|01 off the bus|_|01 . a tragic|_|01 event|_|01 would have been even|_|03 more tragic|_|01 had he not been there to save|_|06 those people|_|01 . i feel|_|05 bad|_|01 because those individuals|_|01 ( including|_|03 the guy|_|03 who saved|_|06 the passengers|_|01 ) are all now scarred|_|01 for life|_|08 and their lives|_|08 will never|_|02 be the same . their lives|_|08 have been turned|_|20 upside|_|02 down because of someone|_|01 ease|_|02 's senseless|_|01 act|_|02 and are forever|_|02 traumatized|_|01 by it . i hope|_|03 those victims|_|02 get|_|01 the support|_|06 they need|_|03 and i hope|_|03 that the driver|_|02 's family|_|01 receives|_|02 support|_|06
gosh , the emotions|_|01 i felt|_|01 while reading|_|03 that . being a nurse|_|01 , i would be so scared|_|10 of such a mass|_|03 emergency|_|01 and worrying|_|06 about it people|_|01 would make|_|43 it or not . it disgusts|_|02 me that innocent|_|07 people|_|01 would be used|_|01 as human|_|03 shields|_|02 . how could someone|_|01 do that to someone|_|01 else|_|03 ? and they purposely|_|01 brought|_|02 them into the center|_|07 of the city|_|03 with the intention|_|01 of using|_|01 them as human|_|03 shields|_|02 .
a jordanian|_|01 writer|_|01 was shot|_|11 and killed|_|01 outside|_|02 of a courthouse|_|02 due|_|03 to a cartoon|_|02 he posted|_|02 mocking|_|02 isis|_|01 . it 's amazing|_|01 that someone|_|01 could be persecuted|_|01 for mocking|_|02 a terrorist|_|01 organization|_|01 who rose|_|01 to fame|_|02 by killing|_|01 people|_|01 and causing|_|01 civil|_|06 unrest|_|02 . what reasonable|_|03 country|_|04 would prosecute|_|03 someone|_|01 for this ?
here is an article|_|04 that pretty|_|01 much|_|05 sums|_|02 up what most people|_|03 already|_|01 know|_|10 about donald trump|_|02 and his|_|01 campaign|_|01 platform|_|04 . this is highlights|_|02 some of the main|_|03 points|_|23 , including|_|03 his|_|01 stances|_|01 on immigration|_|02 , abortion|_|01 rights|_|01 , gun|_|02 rights|_|01 , corey , the clinton|_|04 , and a variety|_|03 of other topics|_|02 . it 's a good|_|12 refresher|_|01 .
death|_|06 to the police|_|01 ! there is no member|_|01 of the police|_|01 that is your friend|_|05 , even|_|04 those who are no longer|_|01 on the force|_|08 . only someone|_|01 who fully|_|01 recants|_|01 their position|_|02 as a police|_|01 officer|_|01 and demonstrates|_|01 tangible|_|03 remorse|_|01 about their actions|_|09 can be accepted|_|05 . all police|_|01 are evil|_|01 , because the police|_|01 naturally|_|04 attract|_|01 people|_|03 who would abuse|_|03 their powers|_|05 .
kyle jenner|_|01 pretending|_|42 like|_|02 she cares|_|02 about other people|_|01 . she makes|_|02 a transparent|_|04 marketing|_|02 move|_|01 to promote|_|02 her own product|_|05 by making|_|02 up reasons|_|06 other companies|_|03 products|_|05 are bad|_|01 . it 's disingenuous|_|01 fax|_|02 concern|_|02 and anyone who reads|_|03 it should see|_|10 through the crap|_|01 . it is disgusting|_|02 and she should just advertise|_|02 like|_|02 a decent|_|06 human|_|02 being would .
people|_|01 often|_|01 think|_|03 of what it must|_|01 be like|_|02 to be in the 1|_|01 % and be ultra|_|01 successful|_|01 . but often|_|01 times|_|05 we forget|_|04 about the many|_|01 pressures|_|06 and responsibilities|_|02 that come|_|04 a long|_|03 with that . take|_|19 mikhail lenin|_|01 for example|_|01 . the man|_|08 was very well|_|07 know|_|01 and successful|_|01 and look|_|02 what happened|_|01 to him he wound|_|03 up dead|_|16 just like|_|02 everyone else|_|03 . now , the conclusion|_|01 is that it was an accident|_|02 , but the type|_|06 of people|_|01 and industries|_|02 and location|_|04 of the world|_|08 leaves|_|06 a lot|_|02 of speculation|_|01 . i guess|_|02 thatch|_|01 a price|_|03 you have to pay|_|10 if you make|_|02 enemies|_|03 in the world|_|08 . you are either|_|01 looking|_|02 over your shoulder|_|05 all the time|_|03 or completely|_|01 stressed|_|07 to death|_|05 . what a world|_|08 .
hats|_|01 pretty|_|01 crazy|_|04 that someone|_|01 died|_|01 in jakarta|_|01 . i do n't even|_|01 know|_|05 what the whole|_|02 issue|_|02 was but just to think|_|02 that just like|_|02 that your life|_|01 could be over . i get|_|01 that politics|_|02 is a pretty|_|01 nasty|_|01 sport|_|04 but really|_|01 when you think|_|02 about it , it 's quite|_|03 different|_|03 around|_|04 the world|_|08 then it is here . people|_|01 think|_|02 our current|_|01 state|_|04 of the nation|_|04 is bad|_|01 , can you just imagine|_|02 being in some of these other countries|_|04 where there seems|_|02 to be nothing|_|01 but endless|_|04 political|_|01 strife|_|02 . i 've even|_|01 seen|_|05 government|_|02 members|_|04 punch|_|03 each other in meetings|_|01 in some foreign|_|02 governments|_|02 . the world|_|08 is such a crazy|_|04 place|_|01 .
putting|_|04 make|_|02 up on a train|_|01 , is that just paint|_|03 ? ha|_|02 ha|_|02 . i do n't want|_|05 to make|_|02 too big|_|01 a deal|_|06 about this because it is a different|_|01 culture|_|02 and it would be difficult|_|02 to get|_|02 the full|_|01 gist|_|03 without knowing|_|10 too much|_|01 about it . with that said|_|01 , it 's is pretty|_|02 worrisome|_|01 , in this country|_|02 as well|_|01 , how much|_|01 people|_|03 are telling|_|01 everyone what they should and should n't be doing . live|_|01 and let|_|02 live|_|01 is still|_|04 the best|_|03 way|_|11 to go|_|01 about things|_|08 and comparing|_|02 putting|_|04 on make|_|02 up on a train|_|01 to pooping|_|01 on the train|_|01 is pretty|_|01 ridiculous|_|03 by any standard|_|01 .
so i just read|_|06 that article|_|04 about alexandria|_|02 vera . i know|_|03 you know|_|03 who she is , and i know|_|03 the lawyer|_|01 in you just wants|_|05 to get|_|02 in that case|_|01 . i mean|_|01 , can you imagine|_|01 the nerve|_|03 of a teacher|_|02 to exploit|_|01 a minor|_|01 in that way|_|12 . she deserves|_|01 more than 30|_|01 years|_|03 , if you ask|_|02 me . and the parents|_|02 of the minor|_|10 ought to have been charged|_|02 with something . that is disgraceful|_|12 . i mean|_|01 , what is happening|_|02 in america|_|01 today|_|02 ? some of the things|_|05 i read|_|06 about make|_|08 me sick|_|01 !
this story|_|03 is pretty|_|02 weird|_|02 and i wonder|_|02 why they suffered|_|05 heart|_|01 attacks|_|07 or whatever|_|01 it was in the water|_|01 . if they had per existing|_|02 medical|_|02 conditions|_|06 , would they have known|_|10 it would be a bad|_|01 idea|_|01 to snorkel|_|01 ? there should be more precautions|_|02 in place|_|01 to make|_|01 sure|_|08 people|_|03 are able|_|04 to snorkel|_|01 before they go|_|01 ahead|_|07 and do it .
i read|_|04 a very disturbing|_|02 article|_|02 about a recent|_|03 study|_|10 on depression|_|01 resulting|_|03 from birth|_|05 control|_|02 drugs|_|01 . the study|_|10 was performed|_|03 by the university|_|03 of copenhagen|_|01 and has confirmed|_|01 a link|_|01 between hormonal|_|01 contraceptives|_|01 and depression|_|01 . the study|_|10 was extensive|_|01 and performed|_|03 over a decade|_|01 . the incident|_|02 of depression|_|01 was magnified|_|01 over 28|_|01 % when taking|_|01 the combination|_|07 pill|_|04 , and even|_|03 went|_|01 as high|_|07 as 78|_|02 % in the teenage|_|02 population|_|04 ! alternatives|_|02 to the pill|_|04 which are longer|_|01 - acting|_|01 such as the ring|_|08 and implant|_|01 were even|_|03 higher|_|07 scoring|_|10 in depression|_|01 . one|_|05 outstanding|_|02 take|_|01 - away|_|10 for me in this article|_|02 is the fact|_|04 that women|_|01 are only fertile|_|02 about six|_|01 days|_|01 per month|_|02 as opposed|_|02 to men|_|01 who are basically|_|01 fertile|_|02 every|_|02 day|_|01 , and yet|_|04 the birth|_|05 control|_|02 burden|_|01 falls|_|17 on women|_|01 . hopefully|_|02 men|_|01 will share|_|01 that soon|_|01 .
i just read|_|03 an article|_|02 about tour|_|01 boat|_|01 that capsized|_|01 because of the boat|_|01 operator|_|05 . it was horrific|_|01 reading|_|03 the statements|_|04 of the survivors|_|01 . it brought|_|01 chill|_|01 to my bone|_|02 when they wrote|_|03 many|_|01 situations|_|03 that could of ended|_|02 their lives|_|02 . just imagining|_|02 what i would of done in that situation|_|03 makes|_|18 me feel|_|13 troubled|_|01 because i ca|_|01 nt|_|01 really|_|01 swim|_|05 in open|_|10 water|_|06 . all the survivors|_|01 are now suing|_|01 the company|_|01 for injuries|_|01 , recklessness|_|01 , neglect|_|01 , and trauma|_|01 . pretty|_|01 crazy|_|05 how one|_|06 event|_|01 can change|_|01 the outcome|_|01 of life|_|02 or death|_|01 .
it a tragedy|_|02 when the people|_|03 who are their to protect|_|01 and serve|_|01 us|_|01 are gun|_|02 down for no reason|_|03 . my heart|_|08 goes|_|02 out to both families|_|08 in this situation|_|03 . it totally|_|01 is unfair|_|01 to die|_|04 for no reason|_|03 because of a selfish|_|01 and ill|_|05 man|_|01 . it is really|_|01 upsetting|_|04 that this man|_|01 just decides|_|04 to kill|_|01 police|_|01 officers|_|01 that are on duty|_|02 to protect|_|01 us|_|01 from danger|_|02 .
its crazy|_|01 ! over one|_|05 million|_|01 children|_|02 could n't go|_|01 to school|_|05 because the smog|_|01 was so thick|_|03 ! they said|_|01 its like|_|04 smoking|_|01 40|_|01 cigarettes|_|01 a day|_|04 . that you feel|_|05 like|_|04 you are being choked|_|01 when you walk|_|10 outside|_|01 . could you even|_|01 imagine|_|02 ? parents|_|01 taking|_|01 their kids|_|02 to the docs|_|01 and them saying|_|01 get|_|03 out of the city|_|03 for a few days|_|04 and they will be ok|_|01 . that 's just crazy|_|03 to me . so sad|_|02 .
i did n't realize|_|02 that a dam|_|01 could cause|_|02 so much|_|01 problem|_|01 . it is a shame|_|02 that the people|_|01 who are going|_|03 to be impacted|_|01 the most are the indigenous|_|01 people|_|01 . i do n't understand|_|02 how people|_|01 feel|_|05 it is okay|_|01 to do this to them . maybe|_|01 there are many|_|01 pros|_|02 that i just do n't know|_|01 about and this article|_|04 is focusing|_|02 only on the negative|_|02 of the methyl|_|01 mercury|_|04 . i guess|_|02 this goes|_|03 to show|_|12 that we as a human|_|03 race|_|03 can affect|_|05 the environment|_|02 in maybe|_|01 a not so good|_|13 way|_|11 . what do you think|_|01 about this ? i am curious|_|03 what you have to say|_|11 about this .
that is just crazy|_|03 that a person|_|01 waiting|_|01 on his|_|01 surfboard|_|01 was attacked|_|01 by a shark|_|03 . that must|_|01 have been pretty|_|01 scary|_|01 . i am glad|_|03 that he did n't lose|_|03 a leg|_|07 or anything , but still|_|01 , that would have been very scary|_|01 . all of the sudden|_|01 , boom|_|03 , you are hit|_|04 by a shark|_|03 . i do n't think|_|01 i would want|_|05 to go|_|01 to that place|_|01 again to surf|_|01 if i was a surfer|_|01 . i think|_|01 people|_|01 need|_|02 to be cautious|_|02 when surfing|_|01 . i do n't think|_|01 it is really|_|01 our place|_|01 to force|_|01 sharks|_|03 away|_|01 , as they live|_|01 in the water|_|02 . i think|_|01 people|_|01 just need|_|02 to be smart|_|12 and surf|_|01 where there is a very low|_|03 chance|_|01 of being attacked|_|01 by a shark|_|03 .
i really|_|01 hate|_|01 isis|_|01 . they are the scum|_|02 of the earth|_|01 . i just learned|_|08 that they killed|_|09 over 100|_|01 iraqi|_|01 police|_|01 officers|_|01 in mosul|_|01 . this is the kind|_|01 of thing|_|11 that happens|_|01 when we pull|_|01 our troops|_|04 out of iraq|_|01 . yeah|_|01 we should not have been there in the first|_|02 place|_|01 but we made|_|24 that mistake|_|01 and we now have to take|_|41 responsibility|_|02 for it . i feel|_|05 so bad|_|01 for all the iraqi|_|01 people|_|03 who just want|_|01 to live|_|01 their lives|_|03 in peace|_|04 .

mexico|_|01 is disturbed|_|11 by our current|_|01 president|_|02 donald j|_|01 trump|_|02 . their currency|_|01 pesos|_|01 dropped|_|01 a lot|_|04 when he was elected|_|02 . trump|_|02 wants|_|05 to build|_|05 a wall|_|01 between the two|_|01 countries|_|04 borders|_|03 as well|_|03 . the mexican|_|01 government|_|02 seems|_|04 very apprehensive|_|03 about our new|_|05 glorious|_|03 president|_|02 . their economy|_|04 might|_|01 drop|_|01 due|_|02 to the building|_|07 of the wall|_|01 and lowering|_|01 of all the immigrants|_|01 trying|_|01 to get|_|01 into the u.s.|_|01 by crossing|_|01 into our borders|_|03 .
i honestly|_|02 ca|_|01 n't believe|_|03 i just read|_|06 that whole|_|01 article|_|02 about a frog|_|01 . i absolutely|_|01 despise|_|01 them . they are some of the most vile|_|01 creatures|_|03 on this earth|_|05 . e. but .... there was something pretty|_|01 interesting|_|05 at the end|_|14 of the article|_|02 . one|_|03 of the researchers|_|01 claim|_|02 that over half|_|01 of all species|_|01 will be extinct|_|01 by the end|_|14 of the century|_|01 . that is insane|_|01 ! ! ! ! pretty|_|02 sure|_|07 most of that is due|_|02 to climate|_|02 change|_|01 but we have donald ass hat|_|02 and company|_|01 who refuse|_|05 to acknowledge|_|04 it or its repercussions|_|01 .
i find|_|02 it really|_|01 amusing|_|02 how erika has been around|_|01 since 1947 and not much|_|01 fuss|_|02 was made|_|35 about it until it began|_|04 killing|_|07 people|_|01 stateside . as usual|_|01 , black|_|01 bodies|_|09 are not valued|_|01 or the conditions|_|03 surrounding|_|01 them until the same things|_|07 begins|_|04 to plague|_|01 white|_|12 people|_|01 . erika was minimized|_|01 and downplayed|_|01 for over sixty|_|01 years|_|03 . that says|_|01 a lot|_|05 .

things|_|01 are really|_|01 bad|_|01 in afghanistan|_|01 right|_|01 now - i just read|_|06 an article|_|04 about the latest|_|04 . refugees|_|01 from european|_|01 countries|_|02 are being sent|_|02 home|_|01 to afghanistan|_|01 , only to see|_|01 the turmoil|_|02 first|_|01 - hand|_|06 . and there are problems|_|01 with resources|_|03 getting|_|01 to the people|_|01 who need|_|02 them . so many|_|01 displaced|_|02 people|_|01 in bad|_|01 shape|_|03 . i wish|_|02 countries|_|02 would get|_|01 together|_|05 and share|_|02 resources|_|03 and welcome|_|01 immigration|_|01 . if everyone had enough|_|02 resources|_|03 to live|_|02 comfortably|_|12 , things|_|01 would surely|_|01 improve|_|03 .
just read|_|03 a short|_|09 article|_|04 about the kim guardianship|_|02 robbery|_|01 . pretty|_|01 scary|_|01 for her , and the robbers|_|01 kept|_|04 demanding|_|01 money|_|03 . there were language|_|02 / communication|_|03 issues|_|02 between her and the robbers|_|01 , she thought|_|11 they wanted|_|04 her jewelry|_|01 , and they wanted|_|04 her money|_|03 . i hope|_|02 that she gets|_|14 better|_|21 security|_|05 in place|_|12 so that this never|_|02 happens|_|01 again . the article|_|04 mentioned|_|01 her providing|_|03 information|_|05 about her expensive|_|01 diamond|_|01 ring|_|08 on facebook - i think|_|11 there 's a lesson|_|01 to be learned|_|04 about that .
i 'm deeply|_|01 disturbed|_|02 to hear|_|02 about actions|_|01 being taking|_|01 that could potentially|_|01 curtail|_|01 black|_|04 americans|_|01 ' ability|_|02 to vote|_|01 . the gop|_|01 has obviously|_|01 been working|_|03 to sabotage|_|01 voting|_|01 of minorities|_|02 because they see|_|02 them as a threat|_|03 since they do not traditionally|_|01 vote|_|01 for republican|_|02 candidates|_|02 . this needs|_|01 to stop|_|05 .
i know|_|05 we have been talking|_|02 about climate|_|02 change|_|03 , my friend|_|01 . i read|_|03 a news|_|01 article|_|02 that continues|_|02 to build|_|01 upon the foundation|_|04 knowledge|_|01 that we have speculated|_|04 upon . as it turns|_|10 out , a mere|_|01 one|_|06 degree|_|07 celsius|_|01 change|_|03 can have major|_|04 impacts|_|01 on the ecosystem|_|01 . it affects|_|01 genes|_|01 and ranges|_|03 in species|_|01 . more than eighty|_|01 percent|_|01 of ecosystems|_|01 are being put|_|01 under stress|_|01 . it makes|_|45 me sad|_|02 because we do n't know|_|05 the long|_|01 - standing|_|04 implications|_|02 in the largest|_|06 perspective|_|02 . every|_|02 single|_|03 day|_|01 we can make|_|45 choices|_|02 to help|_|01 negate|_|02 the bad|_|01 choices|_|02 our species|_|01 makes|_|45 towards our environment|_|01 .
i had no idea|_|01 shannon|_|01 daugherty was going|_|01 through breast|_|04 cancer|_|02 . it is such a tough|_|01 situation|_|01 to experience|_|05 . cancer|_|02 really|_|01 does humble|_|01 the soul|_|01 into new|_|01 places|_|01 that one|_|05 never|_|01 thought|_|02 possible|_|01 to emerge|_|04 stronger|_|01 from feeling|_|02 . it sounds|_|02 like|_|02 she faced|_|01 it with a mask|_|04 of strength|_|01 at first|_|01 . after time|_|06 , the real|_|04 emotions|_|01 came|_|02 through where she realized|_|02 the strength|_|01 was not in being stoic|_|01 but admitting|_|08 how tough|_|01 it really|_|01 is to experience|_|05 . it is through supposed|_|02 weakness|_|03 that we become|_|01 stronger|_|01 .
floyd may|_|01 weather|_|01 owes|_|01 a jewelry|_|01 store|_|02 some money|_|01 . it seems|_|02 like|_|02 it 's the richest|_|11 people|_|01 in the world|_|08 that always|_|04 find|_|04 some excuse|_|01 either|_|01 not to pay|_|01 taxes|_|01 or not to pay|_|01 someone|_|01 money|_|01 that is owed|_|01 . he has all that money|_|01 , and he has to be sued|_|01 to pay|_|01 for something that he could have easily|_|03 paid|_|01 for in full|_|05 upfront|_|01 . people|_|01 like|_|02 him are ridiculous|_|02 . there are so many|_|01 people|_|01 out here starving|_|02 , and here he is sitting|_|01 in his|_|01 mansion|_|01 not paying|_|01 for something he bought|_|01 .
i am not sure|_|06 what to think|_|10 of this article|_|01 as i have probably|_|01 a different|_|03 opinion|_|01 than most would . first|_|02 of all why would n't she report|_|06 this at the time|_|03 it happened|_|04 , instead|_|01 of waiting|_|01 years|_|02 and years|_|02 later|_|01 to come|_|03 forward|_|02 ? i get|_|21 the whole|_|02 he 's a powerful|_|01 person|_|01 and nobody|_|04 would believe|_|01 her part|_|01 , but who 's really|_|01 going|_|03 to believe|_|01 her years|_|02 later|_|01 and why would she come|_|03 out with it now and not before ? what change|_|09 ? why is she willing|_|01 to exploit|_|02 this man|_|10 years|_|02 later|_|01 but was n't able|_|04 to do it years|_|02 before ?
hey can you believe|_|01 the crazy|_|05 weather|_|01 we 've been having during the past|_|02 few summers|_|02 ? it 's getting|_|01 really|_|01 ridiculous|_|03 and out of hand|_|01 . they temperatures|_|02 have been crazy|_|05 and the flooding|_|02 is really|_|01 messing|_|02 with people|_|03 's lives|_|01 . we really|_|01 should be paying|_|10 more attention|_|01 to it and need|_|02 to come|_|04 up with some solutions|_|05 fast|_|02 .
i think|_|10 that this is really|_|01 sad|_|02 . it seems|_|02 to be something that is ingrained|_|01 in all humans|_|02 . i am thankful|_|01 that it mostly|_|01 just effects|_|02 children|_|02 , but it seems|_|02 kind|_|01 of hopeless|_|02 that we will ever|_|03 fully|_|01 solve|_|01 this problem|_|02 . i think|_|10 the only real|_|03 way|_|12 is for adults|_|01 to be consistently|_|01 vigilant|_|02 and make|_|08 sure|_|06 that we are not ignoring|_|04 the kids|_|02 that this is effecting|_|01 .

poor|_|01 orangutan|_|01 . i hope|_|03 her treatment|_|03 is successful|_|01 and she is able|_|03 to return|_|01 to living|_|01 in the wild|_|04 , or at least|_|01 in a zoo|_|02 . you hear|_|02 a lot|_|05 of stories|_|02 these days|_|06 about illegal|_|01 animal|_|01 trading|_|01 . humans|_|02 need|_|01 to learn|_|02 that wild|_|04 animals|_|01 are not there for our entertainment|_|01 and should be kept|_|03 in their habitats|_|01 .

a russian|_|01 fighter|_|02 jet|_|03 crashed|_|01 into the mediterranean|_|01 sea|_|01 as it attempted|_|01 to land|_|02 on an aircraft|_|01 carrier|_|05 . the pilot|_|02 safely|_|01 ejected|_|01 from the aircraft|_|01 . many|_|01 russian|_|01 naval|_|01 vessels|_|02 are not off the coast|_|01 of syria|_|01 in russia|_|01 's support|_|01 of the syrian|_|01 government|_|02 . many|_|01 britain|_|01 are concerned|_|02 over russian|_|01 warships|_|01 traveling|_|01 through british|_|01 waters|_|01 . but russia|_|01 says|_|01 its focus|_|01 is about maintaining|_|04 and safeguarding|_|02 it 's maritime|_|02 economic|_|05 activity|_|01 and responding|_|01 to new|_|01 kinds|_|01 of piracy|_|01 and international|_|01 terrorism|_|01 .

it 's very upsetting|_|03 to me that people|_|03 feel|_|05 they still|_|04 need|_|03 to poach|_|01 elephants|_|01 and rhinos|_|01 just for their ivory|_|01 . it 's a species|_|01 that you are making|_|03 extinct|_|02 here . why are people|_|03 not trying|_|01 to control|_|05 or help|_|03 the situation|_|03 more ? there has to be some kind|_|01 d of co|_|01 trolling|_|03 standards|_|05 for the extinction|_|02 of the rhino|_|01 and elephant|_|01 . i believe|_|01 i saw|_|01 something not that long|_|01 ago|_|01 that actually|_|02 painted|_|03 the tusks|_|01 and got|_|01 s of elephants|_|01 and rhinos|_|01 that permanently|_|01 stained|_|01 them so the poachers|_|02 work|_|01 not beadle|_|02 ti|_|01 use|_|04 the ivory|_|01 . they stained|_|01 them a pink|_|01 or blue|_|02 color|_|01 . we should try|_|01 and regulate|_|02 that and do that so no one|_|01 will kill|_|01 these animals|_|01 . if that 's possible|_|01 .

i and my friend|_|01 always|_|05 remain|_|04 together|_|04 . he has done a lot|_|07 of help|_|01 for me . he has been very hard|_|01 for some time|_|03 to help|_|05 me with money|_|03 . but he did not expect|_|04 me anything.he is one|_|05 of my family|_|06 . he has great|_|02 affection|_|01 for me.he and i have come|_|02 together|_|04 in the school|_|05 season.from that day|_|01 he and i were not separated|_|09 .
mfg . seriously|_|01 ? ! this can not be real|_|02 . i refuse|_|05 to believe|_|01 this is real|_|02 . someone|_|01 made|_|27 this crap|_|01 up , right|_|07 ? japanese|_|01 culture|_|02 historically|_|02 famously|_|01 disregards|_|02 and degrades|_|02 women|_|01 ( eh : geisha|_|01 girls|_|02 ) , but ff what year|_|03 is this ? < slowly|_|01 bangs|_|03 head|_|08 on desk|_|01 > japanese|_|01 women|_|01 still|_|04 cover|_|26 their mouths|_|01 when they laugh|_|01 . are japanese|_|01 men|_|01 that threatened|_|03 by empowering|_|01 women|_|01 ? cause|_|01 i 'm thinking|_|10 apparently|_|01 so .
hey dude|_|06 did you see|_|01 that article|_|03 that come|_|02 out about police|_|01 torture|_|05 in chicago|_|03 ? it 's pretty|_|02 crazy|_|03 and damning|_|03 - it 's one|_|05 thing|_|01 to know|_|05 this kinda|_|02 thing|_|01 has been going|_|01 on but its another|_|01 thing|_|01 to see|_|01 all of these actual|_|04 documents|_|01 talk|_|02 about willingly|_|01 torturing|_|02 people|_|03 and that it 's still|_|01 going|_|01 on today|_|02 . how disgusting|_|01 .
firstly|_|01 let|_|01 me say|_|01 that she was not asking|_|01 for it just by wearing|_|09 expensive|_|01 jewelry|_|01 . the same people|_|01 who believe|_|01 that are those who believe|_|01 women|_|02 are asking|_|01 to be assaulted|_|01 just by wearing|_|09 provocative|_|02 clothes|_|01 ; dis|_|01 gusting|_|01 . secondly|_|01 , let|_|01 me just say|_|01 that i respect|_|02 chloe for expressing|_|02 her love|_|02 and not being afraid|_|02 of all the haters|_|01 out there . respect|_|06 .
did you see|_|05 where that australian|_|01 hiker|_|01 found|_|02 after 2|_|01 weeks|_|01 in malaysian|_|01 jungle|_|03 . he only had one|_|05 day|_|01 of food|_|03 with him . he lived|_|01 on berries|_|03 and stuff|_|06 . i think|_|05 i could survive|_|01 in the woods|_|01 like|_|02 that . i know|_|05 a lot|_|02 about native|_|02 plants|_|04 so i would do pretty|_|01 good|_|13 . of course|_|04 as long|_|02 as it was n't some place|_|01 cold|_|01 . the jungle|_|03 would be hard|_|08 but only if there are wild|_|04 animals|_|01 that would like|_|02 to eat|_|06 you for their food|_|03 . at least|_|01 the weather|_|01 would be better|_|13 .
i just read|_|06 about the haitians|_|01 who came|_|02 here after the earthquake|_|02 . while i wish|_|01 we could help|_|01 everyone we just ca|_|01 n't . only so many|_|01 resources|_|02 in this country|_|04 and unless we want|_|01 to become|_|03 another|_|01 3rd|_|01 world|_|01 country|_|04 we have to send|_|02 them home|_|01 . make|_|03 them wait|_|01 in line|_|03 just like|_|02 any other legal|_|05 immigrant|_|01 . why should they be given|_|04 special|_|04 privileges|_|01 to be in this country|_|04 . i hate|_|01 to be mean|_|06 but if you are n't here legally|_|02 then you have to go|_|03 home|_|01 .
unbelievable|_|01 ! i just read|_|06 an very disturbing|_|01 article|_|04 about a 23|_|01 year|_|03 old|_|01 male|_|03 teacher|_|02 charged|_|20 with multiple|_|01 counts|_|03 of child|_|03 pornography|_|01 that was taking|_|04 place|_|01 at the school|_|05 he teased|_|02 in . he managed|_|02 to get|_|02 away|_|01 with this crime|_|01 for a very long|_|01 time|_|03 as he lured|_|01 hundreds|_|01 of children|_|03 into his|_|01 scheme|_|02 before finally|_|01 getting|_|02 busted|_|42 . it really|_|01 pisses|_|49 me off that scum|_|02 bags|_|02 like|_|02 this are allowed|_|06 near|_|01 our children|_|03 and i hope|_|03 he gets|_|02 a max|_|03 sentence|_|01 !
wow|_|02 , this is tragic|_|01 . i really|_|01 hope|_|03 that china|_|01 will improve|_|02 their safety|_|02 standards|_|05 , but i know|_|11 this is a big|_|01 problem|_|01 all over in developing|_|01 countries|_|01 . remember|_|01 when that factory|_|01 burned|_|21 down in bangladesh|_|01 ? and we ca|_|01 n't pretend|_|07 this is n't our problem|_|01 too , when we support|_|10 them economically|_|03 . if we buy|_|05 products|_|02 created|_|02 in unsafe|_|02 working|_|01 conditions|_|06 , we have a hand|_|12 in those deaths|_|04 too .
i 'm not sure|_|07 why this qualifies|_|01 as news|_|01 ... i do n't care|_|01 about whatever|_|01 is happening|_|01 in maria|_|02 carey 's life|_|03 . i especially|_|01 do n't care|_|01 about guys|_|03 making|_|43 other guys|_|03 jealous|_|02 .... i feel|_|05 for her ex|_|02 boyfriend|_|01 or husband|_|01 or whatever|_|01 , as it 's not cool|_|02 to purposely|_|01 make|_|43 an ex|_|01 jealous|_|02 . she could still|_|04 meet|_|05 him but i would do it away|_|02 from cameras|_|01 .
what a shame|_|01 . i wish|_|04 the article|_|04 went|_|02 more into detail|_|04 about what happened|_|01 to the actress|_|01 and the guy|_|03 she was with . i 'm assuming|_|03 they just broke|_|02 in and then used|_|01 tear|_|02 gas|_|01 on the couple|_|05 ? how did they escape|_|01 from the masked|_|01 men|_|01 ? or did the masked|_|01 guys|_|03 just steal|_|03 stuff|_|01 and then leave|_|01 ? i 'm not sure|_|02 what the gun|_|01 laws|_|01 in france|_|02 are but these reports|_|04 would make|_|27 me feel|_|05 uneasy|_|05 there .
better|_|02 go|_|01 stock|_|02 up on coconut|_|03 products|_|01 . it seems|_|02 coconuts|_|03 are in danger|_|04 due|_|02 to some bacteria|_|01 wiping|_|01 out coconut|_|03 trees|_|03 in the caribbean|_|02 . many|_|01 fear|_|03 it will spread|_|03 to other coconut|_|03 producing|_|02 countries|_|01 . the techno|_|01 people|_|01 are trying|_|01 to breed|_|04 some kind|_|01 of cure|_|02 . they are using|_|01 gene|_|01 banks|_|05 to come|_|04 up with a solution|_|03 but costs|_|03 are prohibitive|_|01 . there ’s an international|_|01 coconut|_|03 genetic|_|01 resources|_|02 network|_|01 or cogent|_|01 that ’s getting|_|08 some funding|_|11 but even|_|03 it ’s in trouble|_|06 financially|_|01 . they are looking|_|02 for coconut|_|03 product|_|01 users|_|01 and big|_|11 companies|_|03 to help|_|01 out . have a heart|_|07 , save|_|06 the coconut|_|03 trees|_|03 !
it looks|_|02 like|_|02 wells|_|05 fargo|_|01 was illegally|_|01 confiscating|_|01 cars|_|01 of service|_|01 members|_|01 to pay|_|01 off debts|_|03 , repossessing|_|02 them . this is a terrible|_|02 situation|_|01 and thing|_|09 to do , i ca|_|01 n't imagine|_|02 having my car|_|01 repossessed|_|02 , and how awful|_|01 that must|_|01 be on so many|_|01 levels|_|07 . not having your car|_|01 , having to watch|_|06 them take|_|08 it away|_|01 , and everything .
i 've noticed|_|04 there is a lot|_|05 of disasters|_|03 going|_|03 on in the world|_|08 . it is scaring|_|01 me a little|_|02 . i think|_|02 that us|_|01 humans|_|02 have fault|_|07 for that . this world|_|08 cares|_|02 way|_|11 to much|_|01 about money|_|01 . if we did n't care|_|02 to much|_|01 about money|_|01 we would have less|_|03 problems|_|01 going|_|03 on . i honestly|_|01 feel|_|05 this world|_|08 is coming|_|04 to an end|_|05 . i do n't see|_|01 any improvements|_|03 or feel|_|05 there is going|_|03 to be any improvements|_|03 . there is more natural|_|06 disasters|_|03 , new|_|01 diseases|_|01 , obesity|_|01 , cancer|_|05 more and more people|_|01 are dying|_|04 . so many|_|01 people|_|01 need|_|03 mental|_|05 help|_|01 a lot|_|05 of us|_|01 are very depressed|_|02 and anxious|_|01 . i think|_|02 it is very important|_|01 for us|_|01 to stay|_|10 closer|_|01 to god|_|01 .
a lot|_|04 of us|_|01 not just veterans|_|01 are losing|_|08 sleep|_|01 . i believe|_|01 its because of depression|_|01 . we are n't happy|_|02 and its because of money|_|01 . humans|_|02 are always|_|04 working|_|03 they have no life|_|01 . work|_|02 is not life|_|01 . some people|_|01 do n't get|_|02 to spend|_|02 time|_|02 with there kids|_|02 or family|_|08 . they ca|_|01 nt|_|01 even|_|02 have time|_|02 for themselves . there worried|_|01 about work|_|02 , what time|_|02 they have to get|_|02 up , or what they will eat|_|05 because they do n't have time|_|02 to cook|_|02 . so we eat|_|05 unhealthy|_|03 thing|_|08 that can lead|_|03 to depression|_|01 . not getting|_|02 enough|_|02 sleep|_|01 or the right|_|08 nutrients|_|02 lead|_|03 to sicknesses|_|02 . therese|_|03 people|_|01 who do n't have enough|_|02 time|_|02 to see|_|01 a doctor|_|01 . our lifestyle|_|01 is the reason|_|06 we 're not getting|_|02 enough|_|02 sleep|_|01 . people|_|01 put|_|01 way|_|11 to much|_|04 on there plate|_|06 just so they can have money|_|01 . everything is about money|_|01 .
i ca|_|01 n't imagine|_|02 the fear|_|02 and anger|_|02 that must|_|01 be happening|_|03 for these people|_|01 to not only be attacked|_|03 in this manner|_|01 but to be in such a remote|_|04 area|_|01 that help|_|01 can not get|_|02 you in a timely|_|02 fashion|_|01 . these senseless|_|01 acts|_|02 are obviously|_|01 those of cowards|_|01 that have no regard|_|01 for human|_|03 life|_|01 and should be captured|_|11 and dealt|_|02 with harshly|_|01 . there is not enough|_|02 room|_|04 in this world|_|08 for people|_|01 that would do this to others for any cause|_|01 or religion|_|01 . i hope|_|03 that everyone that can be saved|_|06 and cared|_|02 for is able|_|03 to get|_|02 what they need|_|01 in order|_|01 to recover|_|04 physically|_|01 . i know|_|01 that the emotional|_|06 healing|_|02 for all of them and their families|_|01 will take|_|06 much|_|01 more time|_|02 and help|_|01 for these poor|_|01 people|_|01 that have had to endure|_|01 such an atrocity|_|02 . i can only hope|_|03 we never|_|01 see|_|01 events|_|01 such as this in my own family|_|01 .
" hos|_|01 mother|_|01 would wish|_|02 their child|_|03 dead|_|02 over being blind|_|01 . that has to be one|_|05 of the worst|_|14 things|_|08 i have read|_|03 in quite|_|04 some time|_|03 . i have a very hard|_|01 time|_|03 digesting|_|07 that the mother|_|01 could overcome|_|01 her daughter|_|01 's death|_|06 over her blindness|_|01 , she clearly|_|01 has some things|_|08 that she needs|_|01 to work|_|12 out because while being blind|_|02 is not ideal|_|02 the girl|_|05 can and will overcome|_|01 her injury|_|02 . it is truly|_|01 unfortunate|_|03 that they live|_|01 n|_|03 a place|_|01 where the need|_|01 to " " own " " land|_|02 comes|_|04 at the cost|_|03 of this girls|_|05 eyesight|_|01 . it seems|_|04 to me it was in an effort|_|02 to reduce|_|01 killing|_|02 that these pellets|_|02 were used|_|04 and a horrible|_|03 accident|_|01 that injured|_|01 her . "
seriously|_|01 , timeshares ? ! i can not believe|_|01 it is even|_|01 an issue|_|02 for someone|_|01 to get|_|02 relinquish|_|01 their timeshare . these companies|_|03 seem|_|02 to want|_|01 to be your best|_|03 friend|_|01 to get|_|02 you to buy|_|01 a timeshare , but once you do they do not care|_|02 about you , your family|_|08 , or what situation|_|03 your life|_|01 is in . they make|_|02 it hard|_|01 to get|_|02 rid|_|01 of because most of their customers|_|01 are older|_|01 people|_|01 who do n't always|_|04 want|_|01 to go|_|03 through the hassle|_|02 . these people|_|01 need|_|03 assistance|_|02 because the timeshare companies|_|03 make|_|02 it too hard|_|10 to get|_|02 rid|_|01 of . although they may|_|01 say|_|01 that they have an easy|_|03 process|_|03 to relinquish|_|01 , but after undercover|_|01 investigations|_|02 , that proved|_|15 to be wrong|_|01 . if someone|_|01 bought|_|01 something like|_|02 this for their family|_|08 to enjoy|_|02 but now their family|_|08 is grown|_|03 and gone|_|03 , why should they have to continue|_|02 with it ?
i ca|_|01 n't believe|_|01 what a nuisance|_|04 gold|_|01 fish|_|01 can be . the fact|_|03 that they can cause|_|02 so much|_|01 damage|_|02 to an environment|_|02 and have no natural|_|01 predators|_|02 is crazy|_|05 . it makes|_|43 you second|_|01 guess|_|02 flushing|_|07 the fish|_|01 down the toilet|_|04 as it may|_|01 survive|_|02 . it 's hard|_|01 to believe|_|01 that they get|_|02 so big|_|05 since they are usually|_|01 just little|_|02 fish|_|01 in a small|_|03 tank|_|03 . also|_|02 it 's weird|_|02 that they travel|_|01 so far|_|04 considering|_|05 we usually|_|01 just see|_|05 them swimming|_|01 in circles|_|05 .
of course|_|04 i only know|_|01 what i read|_|06 in the article|_|04 . it sounds|_|01 like|_|02 it could be the ex|_|02 police|_|01 officer|_|01 was trying|_|05 to protect|_|02 himself . the son|_|02 was already|_|01 arrested|_|01 for assaulted|_|01 the father|_|01 . i believe|_|01 the police|_|01 will investigate|_|02 the shooting|_|02 and take|_|06 the necessary|_|02 actions|_|01 . i do n't think|_|10 the police|_|01 will look|_|02 the other way|_|01 just because he is an ex|_|02 police|_|01 officer|_|01 .
this man|_|08 should be found|_|02 guilty|_|02 . there is no way|_|01 he forgot|_|04 that his|_|01 son|_|02 was in the car|_|01 . the child|_|02 would have been able|_|04 to speak|_|03 . he would have been in a front|_|04 facing|_|01 car|_|01 seat|_|06 . there is no way|_|01 he did n't see|_|02 him . he is guilty|_|02 and he needs|_|02 to be punished|_|01 . he should be put|_|04 in prison|_|02 for life|_|01 . this poor|_|01 child|_|02 suffered|_|10 a great|_|13 deal|_|06 and this man|_|08 needs|_|02 to suffer|_|10 .
i was shocked|_|01 at these statistics|_|01 . temperatures|_|02 are becoming|_|03 dangerously|_|01 high|_|01 . the culprits|_|01 is the fossil|_|02 fuel|_|01 industries|_|02 . we need|_|01 to hold|_|02 them accountable|_|01 , the government|_|01 has failed|_|09 , but how can we have faith|_|02 in our governments|_|01 to take|_|01 this action|_|01 when they continue|_|02 to hand|_|01 nearly|_|07 hundreds|_|01 of billions|_|03 of dollars|_|03 in government|_|01 subsidies|_|01 to the coal|_|01 , gas|_|01 , and oil|_|01 industries|_|02 ? ending|_|04 these subsidies|_|01 would be a giant|_|01 step|_|01 towards solving|_|01 the climate|_|02 crisis|_|02 saving|_|06 gigs|_|02 ones|_|01 of carbon|_|01 dioxide|_|01 emissions|_|05 , and helping|_|03 make|_|03 clean|_|07 energy|_|01 cheaper|_|01 than fossil|_|01 fuels|_|01 , we need|_|01 to do something and do it now
the state|_|01 in syria|_|01 is bad|_|11 . the syrian|_|01 conflation has a medical|_|02 source|_|03 in rebel|_|01 - held|_|03 aleppo|_|01 told|_|01 the asp|_|02 news|_|01 agency|_|04 that a shortage|_|01 of blood|_|01 meant|_|01 hospitals|_|02 were struggling|_|02 to deal|_|01 with the huge|_|01 number|_|01 of casualties|_|01 caused|_|01 by air|_|06 strikes|_|05 over the past|_|02 four|_|01 days|_|10 . there was also|_|02 no water|_|02 supply|_|02 in many|_|01 areas|_|01 after pumping|_|04 stations|_|05 were damaged|_|02 at the weekend|_|01 , and several|_|01 charity|_|01 kitchens|_|01 were forced|_|01 to close|_|01 because of the violence|_|03 .
this is a very tricky|_|01 story|_|01 , cook|_|02 a 20|_|01 - year|_|01 - old|_|07 business|_|01 major|_|08 with no criminal|_|01 history|_|02 , has seemingly|_|01 been charged|_|03 , tried|_|01 , and convicted|_|01 . there is a lot|_|07 of evidence|_|03 coming|_|05 out to accuse|_|02 him of sexual|_|02 harassment|_|02 and rape|_|03 but he denies|_|03 and calls|_|05 it consensual|_|01 acts|_|05 of sex|_|01 . his|_|01 lawyer|_|01 has asked|_|01 that cook|_|02 is not crucified|_|02 on what is being said|_|01 but by facts|_|03 .
there is some killing|_|02 in indonesia|_|01 most likely|_|01 related|_|05 to muslims|_|01 . overall|_|02 i 'm not surprised|_|01 by this news|_|01 , the islam|_|01 religion|_|02 holds|_|17 many|_|01 radicals|_|02 and there are enough|_|02 proof|_|01 that the top|_|01 leaders|_|01 of these islam|_|01 groups|_|02 support|_|07 oppression|_|03 . just look|_|01 at at all the ha|_|02 jibs|_|01 in these muslim|_|01 countries|_|02 these are sad|_|02 pathetic|_|03 men|_|01 that are afraid|_|02 of women|_|02 .
i just read|_|10 this article|_|04 about a haze|_|01 that was responsible|_|02 for killing|_|01 100,000 people|_|03 . can you believe|_|01 that ! ? the haze|_|01 was caused|_|01 by fires|_|07 used|_|01 to clear|_|11 rain|_|03 forest|_|02 , if i remember|_|07 correctly|_|01 . i mean|_|04 could you imagine|_|02 that happening|_|01 here . it is unfathomable|_|03 . i know|_|11 we have our wildfires|_|01 but very few people|_|03 die|_|01 to them . imagine|_|02 what people|_|03 are going|_|01 through .
a car|_|04 taliban|_|01 car|_|04 bomb|_|05 exploded|_|06 in front|_|02 of the german|_|01 consulate|_|01 in afghanistan|_|01 . it killed|_|01 100|_|01 people|_|03 . these type|_|06 of events|_|03 are to come|_|10 these days|_|01 . i mean|_|04 how does anyone process|_|05 them any more . i 'm personally|_|04 numb|_|03 to all this now . it might|_|01 as well|_|07 be fiction|_|01 at this point|_|23 . it seems|_|02 like|_|02 i hear|_|02 about similar|_|01 incidents|_|01 like|_|02 this everyday|_|01 . i do n't know|_|07 .
even|_|04 though|_|01 fewer people|_|01 are crossing|_|01 this year|_|03 than in 2015 , more people|_|01 are dying|_|09 as they try|_|01 to make|_|37 the journey|_|01 . bodies|_|03 of migrants|_|01 in a boat|_|01 off the coast|_|01 of libya|_|01 in october|_|01 . at least|_|01 29|_|01 people|_|01 died|_|09 in the incident|_|02 , all in their 20s|_|01 . one|_|06 person|_|01 out of every|_|01 88|_|01 has been lost|_|07 at sea|_|01 trying|_|01 to reach|_|07 the shores|_|01 of greece|_|02 , italy|_|01 or spain|_|01 . that means|_|04 they 're 90|_|01 times|_|06 more likely|_|01 to die|_|09 on the journey|_|01 than an american|_|01 is likely|_|01 to die|_|09 of gunshot|_|01 wounds|_|04 .

i font|_|01 really|_|01 have feeling|_|13 towards the article|_|02 i just read|_|03 . this article|_|02 did not really|_|01 interest|_|01 me in the slightest|_|01 . on the other hand|_|07 i do feel|_|13 like|_|04 any one|_|06 that is associated|_|01 with bin|_|01 laden|_|01 or that any one|_|02 that is as sympathizer|_|02 or a terrorist|_|01 should be indicted|_|01 and charged|_|02 with acts|_|04 of terrorism|_|01 .
what 's going|_|01 on in venezuela|_|01 is just tragic|_|01 . the government|_|02 has no concern|_|04 for it 's citizen|_|01 's . these are just kids|_|02 trying|_|01 to get|_|02 an education|_|03 . they ca|_|01 n't get|_|02 a proper|_|04 meal|_|01 . waiting|_|01 in line|_|27 doing anything to help|_|01 their children|_|02 . how can we let|_|01 this go|_|01 on . no one|_|01 can be expected|_|05 to learn|_|02 or do anything productive|_|03 if they ca|_|01 n't even|_|01 get|_|02 the basic|_|02 necessities|_|02
what a tragedy|_|02 this is ! i feel|_|01 so bad|_|01 for all the owners|_|02 who lost|_|07 their pets|_|01 in that situation|_|06 . pets|_|01 are like|_|01 members|_|01 of your family|_|08 , and losing|_|07 a pet|_|01 is no different|_|01 . my heart|_|01 goes|_|01 out to all of the people|_|03 who are effected|_|02 by this . there is nothing|_|01 this business|_|01 can do to bring|_|04 back|_|05 the animals|_|01 that died|_|11 and ease|_|01 the owners|_|02 suffering|_|03 . hopefully|_|02 they never|_|02 let|_|02 something like|_|01 this happen|_|01 again .
that poor|_|06 boy|_|04 must|_|01 have just gotten|_|01 curious|_|03 and looked|_|02 down , or perhaps|_|01 he tripped|_|05 and fell|_|08 into it . i ca|_|01 n't imagine|_|02 the pain|_|04 he must|_|01 have gone|_|01 through being stuck|_|01 in there for days|_|05 until he finally|_|01 died|_|04 . that must|_|01 have been agonizing|_|01 and terrible|_|01 . how could the father|_|02 not have found|_|01 him by then ? surely|_|01 he screamed|_|02 ? it 's so sad|_|02 .
as someone|_|01 who graduated|_|02 with a stem|_|01 degree|_|05 i know|_|05 firsthand|_|01 just how few women|_|01 there are in the field|_|03 . it 's very sad|_|02 , and it does indeed|_|01 rob|_|01 us|_|01 of talent|_|02 . all you have to do is look|_|02 around|_|04 to see|_|01 how america|_|01 is still|_|03 a man|_|01 - run|_|01 country|_|04 . the number|_|01 of women|_|01 in power|_|03 is small|_|01 , and women|_|01 feel|_|05 conflicted|_|02 between what society|_|02 says|_|01 they should do and what they want|_|03 to do . after all , many|_|01 have aspirations|_|01 besides|_|01 raising|_|23 kids|_|01 . who says|_|01 that the ' house|_|05 - mom|_|01 ' idea|_|06 is right|_|04 ? the gender|_|04 gap|_|01 needs|_|02 to close|_|17 , and the wage|_|01 gap|_|01 . women|_|01 are not paid|_|10 as much|_|01 as men|_|01 . that 's a fact|_|03 .
it is appalling|_|02 that there are places|_|01 that would actively|_|01 want|_|05 to get|_|03 immunized|_|02 and ca|_|01 nt|_|01 due|_|02 to lack|_|06 of resources|_|01 . while at the same time|_|04 in america|_|01 there are parents|_|01 who actively|_|01 keep|_|02 their children|_|04 from getting|_|03 them . their should be social|_|06 consequences|_|03 in place|_|01 the parents|_|01 who intentionally|_|01 endanger|_|02 their children|_|04 like|_|02 this . i would think|_|03 a hefty|_|02 tax|_|01 that goes|_|01 to implementing|_|02 vaccines|_|01 in impoverished|_|01 areas|_|01 would be a great|_|13 idea|_|03 .
" here is another|_|01 upsetting|_|01 article|_|02 i am sending|_|02 you about a fire|_|03 and a family|_|02 . funny|_|01 how this bothers|_|01 me more than the previous|_|01 one|_|01 . the parents|_|01 and the children|_|02 got|_|02 out safe|_|02 and they did n't die|_|01 and they did n't get|_|02 maimed|_|01 or even|_|03 scratched|_|03 as far|_|03 as i can tell|_|01 but their two|_|01 cats|_|02 died|_|01 and they lost|_|05 their home|_|01 . i am a cat|_|02 owner|_|02 and they are always|_|04 " " skirmished|_|01 " " and afraid|_|03 so my first|_|02 thought|_|05 is how terrified|_|01 they must|_|01 have been and then how awful|_|01 the children|_|02 must|_|01 feel|_|05 . the horror|_|01 of imagining|_|02 your pet|_|01 burning|_|01 ( though|_|01 they probably|_|01 died|_|01 from smoke|_|03 ) . the children|_|02 will not understand|_|04 and it will take|_|02 awhile|_|01 to forget|_|04 . "
another|_|01 story|_|03 that i am sending|_|02 about janet reno|_|01 . thought|_|01 she lived|_|07 a good|_|15 and long|_|01 life|_|05 , i always|_|04 felt|_|01 sorry|_|01 for her and always|_|04 wondered|_|03 why she accepted|_|20 the tough|_|04 job|_|01 of attorney|_|01 general|_|03 . i felt|_|01 sorry|_|01 since she was often|_|03 attacked|_|03 for not only political|_|03 reasons|_|03 but her appearance|_|06 also|_|02 . she was unattractive|_|03 and somewhat|_|01 manly|_|01 looking|_|02 and the media|_|02 used|_|01 that against her . made|_|27 fun|_|02 of her . this article|_|04 mentions|_|01 an encounter|_|03 with eleanor roosevelt|_|03 and her looks|_|03 remind|_|01 me of janet . so maybe|_|01 that is why she took|_|20 the post|_|05 . wanted|_|03 to be like|_|01 her hero|_|03 .
the article|_|04 also|_|02 good|_|01 . the four|_|01 key|_|01 things|_|11 can do while helping|_|01 a friend|_|01 who may|_|01 have anxiety|_|02 or hanging|_|05 out with their friends|_|01 as much|_|01 anymore|_|01 or are always|_|05 tired|_|02 and feeling|_|06 down . suggest|_|01 they see|_|17 a doctor|_|04 or health|_|02 professional|_|05 and/or help|_|01 them to make|_|01 possible|_|01 , the person|_|01 's spouse|_|01 or a mutual|_|01 friend|_|01 may|_|01 be able|_|02 to give|_|18
the article|_|04 also|_|02 good.but some times|_|06 also|_|02 said|_|01 medical|_|02 teams|_|02 were examining|_|01 the bodies|_|01 and trying|_|01 to determine|_|01 their identities|_|02 . “ the investigation|_|01 is just beginning|_|04 , ” he said|_|01 . the iraqi|_|01 joint|_|01 command|_|04 issued|_|02 a brief|_|02 statement|_|01 condemning|_|01 the islamic|_|01 state|_|04 . “ gangs|_|01 of isis|_|01 militants|_|01 continue|_|03 to commit|_|01 crimes|_|02 against our people|_|01 , ” the military|_|01 said|_|01 . fighters|_|02 from the islamic|_|01 state|_|04 , also|_|02 known|_|05 as isis|_|01 , have held|_|01 the city|_|03 of mosul|_|01 and surrounding|_|01 towns|_|02 and villages|_|01 for more than two|_|01 years|_|03 .
how could this guy|_|03 been shot|_|04 several|_|03 times|_|01 , yet|_|04 managed|_|01 to make|_|01 it to the hospital|_|02 and tell|_|05 what happened|_|04 to him . it would seem|_|02 like|_|02 he would be in critical|_|04 condition|_|03 if that 's the case|_|01 . sounds|_|02 very suspicious|_|01 . and for what reason|_|01 would a random|_|01 person|_|01 just be blindly|_|02 shooting|_|17 in a night|_|07 club|_|01 . the reporters|_|01 need|_|02 to get|_|14 down to what really|_|01 happened|_|04 there .
i have come|_|04 across|_|02 an article|_|04 about the civilian|_|01 casualties|_|01 in afghanistan|_|01 . the war|_|04 is such a terrible|_|02 thing|_|03 . small|_|10 children|_|04 are dying|_|01 just because of some military|_|03 operations|_|06 , i.e.|_|01 some grown|_|01 - ups|_|01 can not negotiate|_|02 and agree|_|05 on resolution|_|01 of the disagreements|_|01 . my heart|_|07 aches|_|02 as i read|_|03 that burnt|_|03 children|_|04 corpses|_|01 are tended|_|02 by mourning|_|01 relatives|_|02 . it must|_|01 be unbearably|_|01 painful|_|02 to exist|_|01 in such pitiful|_|01 condition|_|06 in such a poor|_|01 country|_|04 and on top|_|08 of that to lose|_|03 your children|_|04 . life|_|10 is so unfair|_|01 and cruel|_|01 sometimes|_|01 .
it is known|_|04 that endoscopy|_|01 saves|_|06 lives|_|01 , but the preparation|_|01 can be so unpleasant|_|01 . i am so happy|_|04 that researchers|_|01 are working|_|03 towards making|_|03 it more tolerable|_|01 so that more people|_|01 will undergo|_|01 the procedure|_|07 that can save|_|06 their lives|_|01 . i am happy|_|04 that many|_|01 different|_|01 options|_|02 are available|_|01 : not all involving|_|01 colon|_|01 cleansing|_|02 ( e.g.|_|01 x|_|02 - rays|_|03 ) , that there is a dietary|_|01 advice|_|01 to minimize|_|01 the discomfort|_|02 ( which food|_|03 to eat|_|06 before the procedure|_|07 ) , etc . so , the person|_|01 ’s quality|_|01 of life|_|01 , their well|_|13 - being in the short|_|01 term|_|01 is taken|_|05 seriously|_|01 into account|_|03 .
global|_|01 warming|_|02 is real|_|04 . the effects|_|03 that is having on the polar|_|01 bears|_|02 will soon|_|01 have the same effects|_|03 on us|_|01 . the research|_|01 is showing|_|01 that the bears|_|02 are having shorter|_|09 seasons|_|03 of breeding|_|03 and hunting|_|01 . the ice|_|01 is melting|_|09 at a constant|_|01 rate|_|01 , but there is already|_|01 a 7|_|01 to 9|_|01 day|_|01 shift|_|01 on the b|_|02 time|_|03 that they spend|_|03 on the ice|_|01 . they do most of their hunting|_|01 on the ice|_|01 and that how to meet|_|10 their mates|_|07 , so it is very important|_|01 to them . it may|_|01 not seem|_|02 important|_|01 to you yet|_|04 , but as the ice|_|01 melts|_|01 it will not only hurt|_|06 the bears|_|02 it will hurt|_|06 you too . rising|_|13 sea|_|03 level|_|07 will hurt|_|06 people|_|03 like|_|04 you that live|_|02 in coastal|_|02 areas|_|01 . i hope|_|03 you change|_|01 your mind|_|01 on how you feel|_|05 about global|_|01 warming|_|02 and the melting|_|01 of the ice|_|01 . our actions|_|10 may|_|01 have an affect|_|01 on the polar|_|01 bears|_|02 and i believe|_|01 we should think|_|01 about it .
before reading|_|06 this article|_|04 i use|_|01 to think|_|13 that flint|_|03 was the only major|_|08 water|_|02 problem|_|01 and i know|_|01 that people|_|03 have more on , but flint|_|03 is still|_|03 having a water|_|02 problem|_|01 . i 'm mad|_|01 that california|_|01 is the only state|_|01 to pass|_|01 laws|_|01 for people|_|03 to have rights|_|01 to clean|_|04 water|_|02 . i know|_|01 california|_|01 has water|_|02 issues|_|04 with drought|_|02 , but nobody|_|04 should go|_|02 with out clean|_|04 water|_|02 . reading|_|06 the article|_|04 , reminds|_|01 me that this is a world|_|08 wide|_|02 issue|_|04 and we must|_|01 figure|_|01 a way|_|11 to provide|_|03 fresh|_|11 and clean|_|04 water|_|02 to everyone . especially|_|01 those in need|_|01 .
it feels|_|05 like|_|02 this is a bit|_|05 of a lie|_|03 and them just trying|_|01 to fear|_|03 monger|_|01 and use|_|07 gm|_|01 's . grass|_|01 and other things|_|11 will survive|_|02 .. global|_|01 warming|_|09 simply|_|04 means|_|05 that we have too much|_|01 pollution|_|01 and it affects|_|01 everything . reduce|_|09 pollution|_|01 and chemicals|_|01 and we wo n't have such an issue|_|04 . this article|_|04 is simply|_|04 scientists|_|01 trying|_|01 to make|_|02 us|_|01 sicker|_|06 with more chemicals|_|01 .
i am not sure|_|07 what i just read|_|05 . it seems|_|02 to be about some sports|_|04 event|_|03 which i care|_|02 little|_|03 about . sports|_|04 are not my favorite|_|01 thing|_|08 and i do n't know|_|01 how anyone could lose|_|11 sleep|_|03 over a sports|_|04 event|_|03 . much|_|05 more important|_|05 things|_|08 in life|_|05 . i also|_|02 am not sure|_|07 how to write|_|01 such a long|_|01 talk|_|02 based|_|01 on a very short|_|01 paragraph|_|01 about sports|_|04 .
this is a dangerous|_|02 occupation|_|01 and i wish|_|02 no one|_|02 would do it . some have to feed|_|03 their families|_|02 so i understand|_|03 if it 's the only job|_|02 available|_|03 . however- the government|_|02 should make|_|36 it safe|_|02 for them . it is unavoidable|_|01 and it seems|_|04 it can not be made|_|36 safer|_|02 . my condolences|_|01 . i would n't want|_|04 my family|_|02 to work|_|03 in one|_|06 .
" so i just had to read|_|03 this article|_|02 for a survey|_|03 . it was completely|_|01 unformulated , an enormous|_|01 text|_|04 - wall|_|07 essay|_|01 list|_|04 . i made|_|02 it all the way|_|01 through though|_|01 . i 'm not really|_|01 into sports|_|04 , which the article|_|02 focused|_|02 on , but the article|_|02 did talk|_|02 about a bunch|_|03 of prominent|_|05 women|_|02 in sports|_|04 and their accomplishments|_|01 . it was a little|_|08 hard|_|01 to follow|_|02 because i 'm not really|_|01 familiar|_|02 with a lot|_|02 of sports|_|04 terminology|_|01 or what accomplishments|_|01 are big|_|01 deals|_|02 . i think|_|03 people|_|01 generally|_|02 care|_|02 more about men|_|01 's performances|_|04 , but it 's good|_|01 that women|_|02 can be recognized|_|02 for their accomplishments|_|01 in sports|_|04 too . there was one|_|06 bit|_|04 about a woman|_|02 who got|_|02 some popularity|_|01 over what the writer|_|01 called|_|03 a " " raunchy|_|01 " " photo|_|01 shoot|_|02 . i think|_|03 that 's kinda|_|02 weird|_|01 that something like|_|02 that was even|_|01 included|_|01 in an article|_|02 with feminist|_|01 tone|_|10 . "
this is really|_|01 sick|_|01 and disturbing|_|02 do n't you think|_|01 ? these soccer|_|01 hooligans|_|01 got|_|01 all rowdy|_|01 and worked|_|01 up and when they were acting|_|01 out like|_|02 idiots|_|01 they hit|_|01 an eleven|_|01 - year|_|01 - old|_|01 child|_|02 in the head|_|01 with a bottle|_|03 . poor|_|01 kid|_|02 had a big|_|13 gash|_|04 and had to go|_|01 to the hospital|_|02 and everything . that 's pretty|_|02 sad|_|02 and pathetic|_|03 , even|_|02 though|_|01 they probably|_|01 did n't really|_|01 mean|_|01 to do it .
this is a terrible|_|02 story|_|02 . in a way|_|01 , i feel|_|01 happy|_|02 that the child|_|03 no longer|_|01 has to suffer|_|10 . had the child|_|03 lived|_|05 he would be mess|_|01 for the rest|_|05 of his|_|01 life|_|05 . i am just angry|_|01 at the mother|_|01 . this is what happens|_|01 when a state|_|02 has weak|_|12 laws|_|06 . she is only facing|_|03 15|_|01 years|_|03 for what she did . she should be given|_|01 the death|_|03 penalty|_|01 . i am disgusted|_|02 with the legal|_|04 system|_|05 . thank|_|01 god|_|01 i do n't live|_|05 in california|_|01 .
dear|_|04 c. , i just read|_|05 an article|_|02 about gun|_|02 deaths|_|01 -- specifically|_|01 when guns|_|02 are used|_|01 against children|_|02 . small|_|02 , isolated|_|02 cases|_|01 that happened|_|01 in small|_|04 towns|_|02 . as i was reading|_|05 the background|_|04 and history|_|04 of the families|_|01 , it occurred|_|02 to me that there 's a strong|_|01 socioeconomic|_|01 component|_|01 present|_|01 , and that the people|_|01 described|_|02 were n't what you and i would call|_|10 middle|_|04 - class|_|07 , and definitely|_|01 not well|_|01 - educated|_|03 . it 's like|_|02 we were talking|_|02 about the other day|_|01 , i do n't think|_|03 that the dens|_|01 can possibly|_|02 win|_|05 this fight|_|05 unless they are able|_|02 to appeal|_|02 to gun|_|01 owners|_|02 . i do n't think|_|03 that this dynamic|_|01 is going|_|04 to change|_|06 -- i mean|_|04 , when you think|_|03 about it , guns|_|01 symbolize|_|02 power|_|05 , and in the article|_|02 i read|_|05 , what came|_|02 across|_|02 is that the people|_|01 who used|_|01 them against children|_|02 ( one|_|05 child|_|02 against another|_|01 ) need|_|03 to feel|_|05 power|_|05 .
" dear|_|01 c. , it 's so weird|_|02 how little|_|01 i know|_|09 about the food|_|02 i eat|_|06 . just read|_|06 an article|_|04 about bananas|_|02 , the kind|_|01 you buy|_|01 in a supermarket|_|01 , which are apparently|_|01 called|_|01 cavendish|_|01 bananas|_|02 and are expressly|_|01 considered|_|05 " " commercial|_|03 " " . apparently|_|01 , commercial|_|03 bananas|_|02 are under threat|_|03 due|_|02 to their lack|_|01 of genetic|_|01 diversity|_|02 , making|_|08 them prone|_|01 to fungal|_|01 diseases|_|01 -- another|_|01 variation|_|02 , " " big|_|04 mike|_|01 " " , went|_|01 the way|_|11 of the buffalo|_|02 in the 60s|_|01 for the same reason|_|06 . i am not certain|_|01 about the suggestion|_|05 that wild|_|01 bananas|_|02 be used|_|01 to produce|_|03 new|_|01 variations|_|02 , tho|_|01 . i have a hunch|_|02 that this would drive|_|02 the cost|_|01 of bananas|_|02 up , which is concerning|_|02 . it might|_|01 be possible|_|01 in someplace|_|01 like|_|02 the u.s.|_|01 , where we have money|_|03 for r|_|01 & d , but i worry|_|03 about how this would affect|_|01 people|_|01 in poorer|_|02 countries|_|04 .

just read|_|03 that due|_|03 to climate|_|02 change|_|09 , hotter|_|13 than normal|_|04 temps|_|01 may|_|01 be the new|_|01 normal|_|04 . in 2013 , temps|_|01 screamed|_|02 up to 122 f. in australia|_|02 , which is frightening|_|01 . but when you think|_|13 about who really|_|01 has the capacity|_|09 to change|_|01 this -- which is each individual|_|01 -- it gets|_|01 even|_|04 more frightening|_|01 . the primary|_|02 cause|_|01 of climate|_|02 change|_|09 is just too many|_|01 people|_|01 , full|_|01 stop|_|08 . i do not have much|_|01 hope|_|04 that people|_|01 will stop|_|05 procreating|_|02 to save|_|08 themselves , and this is the biggest|_|01 tragedy|_|02 of all .
religion|_|02 should be a freedom|_|01 of choice|_|02 . some people|_|01 are christians|_|01 and some are muslims|_|01 or islamic|_|01 . this makes|_|43 me sad|_|02 christians|_|01 chose|_|02 a different|_|01 religion|_|02 so why should the islams|_|02 brutalize|_|02 them and hurt|_|02 them ? that is cruelty|_|03 and one|_|06 of the reasons|_|01 why there will always|_|04 be war|_|01 in those countries|_|04 . i do n't think|_|03 i would ever|_|01 want|_|03 to visit|_|01 those places|_|01 , i would be very scared|_|10 . they target|_|01 christians|_|01 and kill|_|07 priests|_|01 . these people|_|01 are heartless|_|02 , forcing|_|01 these people|_|01 out of their home|_|01 .
i blame|_|02 this on the no - liberal|_|03 policies|_|01 of barack obama . he made|_|02 a lot|_|04 of hope|_|02 and change|_|09 promises|_|02 and delivered|_|02 nothing|_|01 . after 8|_|01 years|_|03 peoples|_|02 lives|_|01 have n't gotten|_|02 better|_|09 . having a choice|_|02 between donald trump|_|02 and hillary|_|01 clinton|_|04 is ridiculous|_|03 . the mainstream|_|01 media|_|02 carries|_|03 a lot|_|04 of this blame|_|01 as well|_|09 for not informing|_|03 the public|_|02 about issues|_|02 and only reporting|_|04 sensationalism|_|02 garbage|_|03 .
the medical|_|01 profession|_|01 is clueless|_|01 according|_|01 to three|_|02 articles|_|04 i just read|_|06 . they have no idea|_|03 how to treat|_|03 obese|_|01 or transgender|_|01 people|_|01 , among others , and doctors|_|03 routinely|_|01 act|_|03 based|_|01 on biases|_|02 and stereotypes|_|01 . for example|_|04 , scales|_|07 are n't calibrated|_|02 or constructed|_|05 to weigh|_|04 obese|_|01 people|_|01 and medication|_|02 dosage|_|01 often|_|05 does n't take|_|06 weight|_|02 into account|_|05 . doctors|_|03 just tell|_|03 patients|_|01 to lose|_|01 weight|_|02 and rush|_|04 them out of the office|_|06 . not that the rest|_|04 of us|_|01 are protected|_|02 from medical|_|01 protocols|_|03 that are outdated|_|01 and sometimes|_|01 harmful|_|01 , either|_|01 . what to do ?
india|_|01 just confirmed|_|03 its participation|_|02 in the paris|_|01 climate|_|02 accord|_|01 . i think|_|10 it 's great|_|01 that the larger|_|01 countries|_|04 of the world|_|03 are willing|_|01 to step|_|10 in and say|_|01 that things|_|09 need|_|02 to change|_|03 . i also|_|02 really|_|01 like|_|02 that they made|_|30 the announcement|_|01 on gandhi|_|02 's birthday|_|02 . i think|_|10 that 's a nice|_|03 and respectful|_|02 way|_|11 to honor|_|02 his|_|01 legacy|_|01 .
it is so hard|_|01 to think|_|09 that you are not safe|_|03 anywhere|_|01 in the world|_|01 , you expect|_|01 to be able|_|04 to go|_|01 out into the world|_|01 and enjoy|_|02 yourself without having to worry|_|02 about someone|_|01 hurting|_|03 you are those around|_|04 you . that is not a concern|_|04 anyone should have to face|_|01 , but it seems|_|03 to be becoming|_|01 more of an issue|_|02 day|_|05 by day|_|05 .
tourist|_|01 who claimed|_|05 she was raped|_|07 in dubai|_|01 is charged|_|02 with extramarital|_|01 sex|_|02 — a british|_|01 tourist|_|01 allegedly|_|01 raped|_|07 by two|_|01 men|_|01 in dubai|_|01 faces|_|04 jail|_|01 after cops|_|05 accused|_|02 her of sex|_|02 outside|_|03 marriage|_|02 . the woman|_|02 , 25|_|01 , claims|_|07 she was attacked|_|01 by two|_|01 u.k.|_|01 men|_|01 last|_|02 month|_|01 . but when she reported|_|06 it , she was locked|_|02 up and charged|_|02 with “ extramarital|_|01 sex|_|02 ” . she is on bail|_|02 but is not allowed|_|06 to leave|_|08 and needs|_|01 $ 30,000 for legal|_|05 fees|_|01 .
i wanted|_|01 to write|_|03 a bit|_|11 to you regarding|_|05 an article|_|04 i just read|_|05 about the confederate|_|02 flag|_|01 . initially|_|01 my feelings|_|02 are a bit|_|11 sadden|_|02 by all the news|_|01 and attention|_|01 this situation|_|02 is creating|_|03 . i myself on the one|_|05 hand|_|07 would sympathize|_|01 with those who are in support|_|10 of the flag|_|01 , like|_|04 putting|_|07 myself in their shoes|_|02 . in matters|_|02 of free|_|01 choice|_|02 , if it is their choice|_|02 to want|_|01 to display|_|03 the flag|_|01 , i support|_|03 their right|_|05 of free|_|01 choice|_|02 . i am also|_|02 in sympathy|_|02 with those that may|_|01 find|_|01 offense|_|03 of the confederate|_|02 flag|_|01 . it may|_|01 in fact|_|02 open|_|03 up old|_|07 wounds|_|03 , and bring|_|02 back|_|05 hurtful|_|01 memories|_|05 . however|_|01 i fully|_|01 support|_|03 our president|_|01 's view|_|03 . president|_|01 and mr.|_|01 donald trump|_|02 feels|_|05 that the confederate|_|02 flag|_|01 should be placed|_|01 in a museum|_|01 . that course|_|04 of action|_|01 is an intelligent|_|04 response|_|01 , for both sides|_|01 of the issue|_|02 . i agree|_|07 .
i totally|_|01 get|_|01 this in a lot|_|05 of ways|_|11 . i used|_|01 to roll|_|03 my eyes|_|05 at people|_|01 who were frothing|_|03 at the mouth|_|01 over obama being elected|_|02 , and how they seemed|_|02 to make|_|43 grand|_|02 statements|_|04 of the world|_|08 ending|_|01 right|_|07 now because a black|_|12 man|_|08 was in the white|_|01 house|_|01 . now ... i do n't know|_|10 . i see|_|05 my friends|_|01 and family|_|01 freaking|_|01 out and i want|_|01 to tell|_|02 them to just chill|_|01 out . obama did n't destroy|_|02 america|_|01 -- the right|_|05 wingers|_|01 were wrong|_|01 about that . neither|_|01 will trump|_|03 . life|_|01 will keep|_|02 going|_|03 . it brings|_|11 a lot|_|05 of stress|_|04 listening|_|02 to people|_|01 freaking|_|01 out all the time|_|01 . and yet|_|01 , i get|_|01 it . i get|_|01 why they are worried|_|02 and freaking|_|01 out . i do n't like|_|02 it either|_|01 , but i do n't get|_|01 the point|_|18 of stressing|_|07 out so much|_|01 . but then again , i 've completely|_|01 dissociated|_|02 from all this . i do n't really|_|01 read|_|06 the news|_|01 anymore|_|01 .
" i had no idea|_|03 that erika was discovered|_|02 in 1947 and that there was an outbreak|_|01 in 2007 . as far|_|03 as i knew|_|10 , it was only the very recent|_|01 outbreak|_|01 that erika was discovered|_|02 . how wrong|_|07 i was . it was actually|_|01 really|_|01 heartening|_|01 to read|_|06 this , because i want|_|01 to start|_|06 a family|_|02 in the next|_|03 few years|_|03 and i was practically|_|01 twitching|_|05 with anxiety|_|02 . i tend|_|03 to get|_|02 bitten|_|02 by a ton|_|01 of mosquitoes|_|01 every|_|02 summer|_|01 no matter|_|02 what i do while my husband|_|01 does n't get|_|02 bit|_|02 at all . and what about global|_|01 climate|_|02 change|_|09 pushing|_|02 things|_|08 like|_|02 this further north|_|02 ? it is good|_|13 to know|_|10 that it comes|_|01 in and out of viral|_|01 " " fashion|_|04 " " and that there is a herd|_|01 immunity|_|01 aspect|_|01 to it . maybe|_|01 i can put|_|02 down the mosquito|_|01 shotgun|_|01 for now and aim|_|11 for a slightly|_|01 stronger|_|07 spray|_|06 for my clothing|_|01 . "
i recently|_|01 discovered|_|02 a few articles|_|04 that i believed|_|01 to be quite|_|02 interesting|_|01 . the first|_|01 article|_|04 talks|_|01 about how people|_|01 argue|_|03 that smoking|_|07 should be banned|_|02 in public|_|02 places|_|01 so that children|_|03 would not imitate|_|03 them . i personally|_|01 do n't have an opinion|_|01 on this matter|_|06 ; i do n't have children|_|03 and i 'm not a smoke|_|07 either|_|01 . the second|_|01 article|_|04 disturbed|_|02 me a great|_|02 deal|_|06 . it talks|_|01 about the work|_|01 of a food|_|03 inspector|_|01 and it surprised|_|01 me how dirty|_|01 some stores|_|01 can be . it really|_|01 makes|_|43 me wonder|_|02 if i should continue|_|02 going|_|01 to that place|_|01 near|_|07 my house|_|01 that does not have a perfect|_|03 score|_|08 .
i think|_|02 it 's so rude|_|01 when people|_|03 mock|_|02 government|_|02 officials|_|02 and get|_|01 so full|_|06 of them selves|_|02 over politics|_|05 . it really|_|01 just burns|_|01 me up that people|_|03 ca|_|01 n't get|_|01 along|_|03 in regards|_|01 to it . i hate|_|01 reading|_|06 about politics|_|05 in general|_|05 and it is even|_|04 worse|_|09 when you have to read|_|06 about grown|_|01 adults|_|02 bickering|_|02 and arguing|_|02 over it all . joe walsh and diana|_|02 duck|_|04 worth|_|03 both are very immature|_|01 . what do you think|_|02 ?
this is a really|_|01 interesting|_|01 article|_|02 about primates|_|02 . it just talks|_|05 about some of the things|_|08 this certain|_|01 species|_|01 of primate|_|02 does as they get|_|01 older|_|03 . they tend|_|02 to adjust|_|01 their position|_|01 so they can see|_|01 things|_|08 better|_|13 as they age|_|01 . the younger|_|01 bonbons|_|01 sit|_|01 close|_|01 to their partner|_|01 when they groom|_|05 but the older|_|03 ones|_|02 sit|_|01 ridiculously|_|01 far|_|04 away|_|01 . i would n't even|_|01 think|_|10 their arms|_|01 could reach|_|02 when i read|_|06 the distance|_|02 was over a foot|_|11 .
this sounds|_|02 like|_|02 a horrible|_|03 accident|_|01 . i ca|_|01 n't even|_|01 imagine|_|02 what that family|_|02 is going|_|01 through . the ones|_|02 that were involved|_|02 in the accident|_|01 but survived|_|01 probably|_|01 saw|_|01 some horrible|_|03 things|_|09 , and those kids|_|02 who witnessed|_|02 their mother|_|01 die|_|03 . as a parent|_|01 myself that 's a terrifying|_|01 thought|_|01 i would never|_|02 want|_|01 my son|_|02 to go|_|01 through something like|_|02 that .
the us|_|01 has done some super|_|03 shady|_|02 things|_|11 . how we treated|_|05 these people|_|03 is horrible|_|03 , and i 'm not sure|_|02 whether i 'm more upset|_|04 or just feel|_|05 bad|_|01 for the americans|_|01 who went|_|03 along|_|04 with it . it sort|_|01 of reminds|_|01 me of the ss officers|_|01 during wwii- like|_|02 at some point|_|23 it seems|_|02 like|_|02 they all realized|_|02 what they were doing was n't kosher|_|02 and definitely|_|01 crossing|_|01 ethical|_|03 boundaries|_|01 . yet|_|01 they all continued|_|02 because .... why ? i know|_|01 the whole|_|02 thing|_|11 about the military|_|01 is going|_|03 along|_|04 and just obeying|_|01 orders|_|01 but what was going|_|03 on there was seriously|_|01 seriously|_|01 messed|_|02 up .
hello|_|01 friends|_|01 , i will take|_|02 part|_|01 in this group|_|01 to tell|_|03 you some important|_|05 news|_|04 . they know|_|01 that i always|_|05 read|_|06 and look|_|02 for information|_|01 . some time|_|04 ago|_|01 it seems|_|02 that a man|_|08 died|_|04 at sea|_|01 after he fell|_|08 off the cruiser|_|01 where he was going|_|01 . the person|_|01 's name|_|04 was bernardo garcia testatrix|_|01 . now his|_|01 partner|_|01 filed|_|05 a lawsuit|_|01 with the royal|_|02 caribbean|_|01 company|_|03 . the people|_|01 of the cruise|_|01 and the police|_|01 also|_|02 allege|_|01 that this couple|_|02 was discussing|_|02 a moment|_|02 before the accident|_|02 happened|_|01 .
hello|_|01 friend|_|02 how are you ? how are your children|_|04 behaving|_|02 ? i do not understand|_|01 much|_|05 about politics|_|05 but now the president|_|02 of this country|_|04 and that of luisa joined|_|04 forces|_|08 when fighting|_|06 against syria|_|01 . they called|_|20 syria|_|01 as the first|_|01 threat|_|03 and classified|_|04 it as terrorists|_|01 . i really|_|01 do not understand|_|01 what is the reason|_|03 for so much|_|01 hearing|_|01 and what was the initial|_|01 problem|_|02 . i know|_|01 that there are many|_|01 good|_|01 people|_|01 in syria|_|01 , so it makes|_|43 me think|_|10 that many|_|01 people|_|01 died|_|01 when the president|_|02 of russia|_|01 bombed|_|07 syria|_|01 . many|_|01 good|_|01 people|_|01 die|_|01 . i consider|_|05 that the war|_|01 does not solve|_|01 anything , it has not done it before and neither|_|01 will it now .
this is a bizarre|_|01 story|_|02 . a man|_|08 bashed|_|01 a turtles|_|01 head|_|29 with a hammer|_|02 in self|_|02 defense|_|01 . he is being held|_|23 on 5000 bail|_|02 . the only part|_|09 of the story|_|02 i find|_|02 interesting|_|05 is that the man|_|08 dragged|_|01 the turtle|_|01 into the middle|_|02 of the road|_|02 and left|_|04 it there . i 'm not sure|_|08 i believe|_|01 the man|_|08 . claiming|_|05 self|_|02 defense|_|01 against a turtle|_|01 seems|_|04 crazy|_|04 . i think|_|02 the man|_|08 could of just left|_|04 the turtle|_|01 alone|_|02 and not of been in this situation|_|02 to begin|_|03 with .
and another|_|01 shooting|_|02 of a black|_|12 man|_|01 by a cop|_|05 . while most of the time|_|05 , i feel|_|05 that the shooting|_|02 is justified|_|01 , with the evidence|_|03 presented|_|01 , i definitely|_|01 think|_|01 this needs|_|03 to go|_|03 to a jury|_|01 for a decision|_|01 . i agree|_|01 that she should have been trained|_|01 for this scenario|_|03 , but no one|_|01 knows|_|05 exactly|_|01 what their emotions|_|01 will be in a situation|_|01 like|_|04 this one|_|05 . it was a domestic|_|04 violence|_|01 call|_|12 , which are extremely|_|01 dangerous|_|02 for police|_|01 officers|_|01 . but i do n't understand|_|02 why less|_|01 than lethal|_|02 methods|_|01 were n't deployed|_|02 first|_|03 .
" so sad|_|02 . why is it that the social|_|05 media|_|02 giants|_|01 can quickly|_|01 shut|_|02 down conservative|_|02 speech|_|05 , but can not get|_|03 a handle|_|01 on these " " suicide|_|02 groups|_|03 " " ? mental|_|05 health|_|02 needs|_|01 to be taken|_|29 more seriously|_|01 in this country|_|04 or any country|_|04 . with mental|_|05 health|_|02 not covered|_|10 by a lot|_|05 of insurance|_|03 policies|_|01 , suicide|_|02 and depression|_|01 will continue|_|01 to be problems|_|01 . i feel|_|04 for these kids|_|01 . i know|_|01 what it feels|_|04 like|_|04 to feel|_|04 depressed|_|02 and hopeless|_|04 . but anyone that preys|_|02 on kids|_|01 in these conditions|_|01 needs|_|01 to go|_|01 to jail|_|01 . it infuriates|_|01 me . "
the japanese|_|02 that made|_|01 up the restriction|_|03 stating|_|02 that you could not apply|_|01 makeup|_|01 while on the train|_|01 are completely|_|01 out of line|_|02 . it is not up to them to dictate|_|03 whether a man|_|08 or woman|_|02 can use|_|01 their commute|_|01 time|_|01 to apply|_|01 makeup|_|01 . there needs|_|02 to be mass|_|01 protests|_|03 , but we know|_|01 there will not be as it is not in their nature|_|05 .
the gun|_|02 issue|_|02 in the united|_|03 states|_|01 of america|_|01 is becoming|_|01 a joke|_|02 for the entire|_|02 world|_|01 to see|_|03 play|_|03 out . apparently|_|01 , as anyone can see|_|03 , guns|_|02 are causing|_|02 more harm|_|01 than good|_|07 in all communities|_|01 . perhaps|_|01 since this fatal|_|01 shooting|_|02 involved|_|06 a cop|_|05 with possible|_|01 mental|_|01 issues|_|02 it will put|_|02 the spotlight|_|02 on both issues|_|02 . i will not hold|_|03 my breath|_|01 though|_|01 .
terrorism|_|01 has become|_|03 so commonplace|_|01 that it does not even|_|04 alarm|_|02 me anymore|_|01 . it is simply|_|03 just another|_|01 day|_|01 in the world|_|08 that we have come|_|02 to live|_|02 in . no one|_|02 really|_|01 wants|_|03 to address|_|09 the reasons|_|02 that drive|_|03 people|_|01 to terrorism|_|01 , so i guess|_|02 we will just continue|_|04 to let|_|01 the media|_|02 sensationalize|_|03 death|_|06 and complain|_|01 about it the next|_|02 day|_|01 .
the hydrogen|_|01 is the poison|_|02 gas|_|02 . it may|_|01 leads|_|23 to severe|_|06 health|_|02 problem|_|01 . so , this is must|_|01 be injurious|_|01 to the human|_|03 body|_|01 . the hydrogen|_|01 is the poison|_|02 gas|_|02 . it may|_|01 leads|_|23 to severe|_|06 health|_|02 problem|_|01 . so , this is must|_|01 be injurious|_|01 to the human|_|03 body|_|01 . the hydrogen|_|01 is the poison|_|02 gas|_|02 . it may|_|01 leads|_|23 to severe|_|06 health|_|02 problem|_|01 . so , this is must|_|01 be injurious|_|01 to the human|_|03 body|_|01 . the hydrogen|_|01 is the poison|_|02 gas|_|02 . it may|_|01 leads|_|23 to severe|_|06 health|_|02 problem|_|01 . so , this is must|_|01 be injurious|_|01 to the human|_|03 body|_|01 . the hydrogen|_|01 is the poison|_|02 gas|_|02 . it may|_|01 leads|_|23 to severe|_|06 health|_|02 problem|_|01 . so , this is must|_|01 be injurious|_|01 to the human|_|03 body|_|01 .
what this also|_|02 taught|_|02 me is that i think|_|06 poverty|_|01 teaches|_|01 you to value|_|02 anything and everything you have .. importance|_|01 of friends|_|02 , importance|_|01 of one|_|05 time|_|06 meal|_|01 , importance|_|01 of tiniest|_|01 thing|_|08 in your life|_|01 .. it teaches|_|02 you to survive|_|02 on bare|_|06 minimum|_|01 . poverty|_|01 teaches|_|01 gratitude|_|01 . some of the most happy|_|02 people|_|01 in the world|_|01 are those people|_|01 who have the least|_|01 . when you are n't flooded|_|04 with tons|_|01 of material|_|04 goods|_|02 you can focus|_|02 more on the simple|_|06 things|_|08 that you do have . look|_|02 at brazil|_|01 the have to struggle|_|03 to eat|_|02 but it 's what keeps|_|04 them humble|_|01 .
what i learned|_|01 from this story|_|01 is that this world|_|08 is really|_|01 fucked|_|01 up . imagine|_|01 forceful|_|01 sex|_|03 at an age|_|01 when your organs|_|05 are not developed|_|01 and when you have complete|_|05 faith|_|02 in everyone around|_|01 you results|_|02 in both physical|_|01 and mental|_|05 trauma|_|01 . you think|_|13 that any person|_|01 who is around|_|01 you and is trying|_|01 to act|_|02 sweet|_|04 with you will end|_|02 up being a molester|_|01 . that is why a victim|_|02 behaves|_|02 like|_|02 that . it 's vile|_|01 man|_|08 .
what i have learned|_|08 from this is that obesity|_|01 is a silent|_|05 killer|_|01 . in most of the cases|_|01 , by the time|_|01 one|_|05 realizes|_|02 that they under the clutch|_|06 of obesity|_|01 and it ’s already|_|01 too late|_|03 for them . some prominent|_|02 signs|_|01 of obesity|_|01 are- lack|_|01 of flexibility|_|01 in body|_|01 , high|_|07 blood|_|01 pressure|_|06 , development|_|07 of cardiac|_|01 issues|_|02 and respiratory|_|01 disorder|_|01 . but a question|_|02 that continues|_|02 to bother|_|02 the patients|_|01 is what caused|_|02 obesity|_|01 in them .
i ’m so tired|_|02 of republicans|_|01 . they never|_|02 compromise|_|01 . they want|_|05 it their way|_|12 . they never|_|02 meet|_|08 in the middle|_|04 or half|_|02 way|_|12 . the government|_|01 is a joke|_|01 and ca|_|01 n’t get|_|18 a thing|_|05 done because of the divide|_|01 in parties|_|05 . democrats|_|01 are willing|_|01 to meet|_|08 in the middle|_|04 but it does’t matter|_|01 because conservatives|_|02 will only have one|_|01 way|_|12 .
do you hear|_|02 about that teacher|_|02 that body|_|01 - slammed|_|01 a student|_|01 and now the student|_|01 lost|_|01 his|_|01 leg|_|01 ? understand|_|04 kids|_|02 can be so wild|_|01 and disrespectful|_|01 why would you body|_|01 slam|_|01 a child|_|03 ? that was my child|_|03 i 'd be furious|_|02 and that individual|_|04 should be very fearful|_|05 of his|_|01 consequences|_|02 for putting|_|01 their hand|_|01 so roughly|_|03 on my child|_|03 regardless|_|03 of what the reason|_|03 was .
this was terrible|_|01 ! i 'm so glad|_|03 that those guys|_|03 got|_|04 arrested|_|01 . it 's never|_|02 okay|_|01 to throw|_|01 bottles|_|03 at people|_|01 , i do n't care|_|02 who you are or what the circumstances|_|03 are . that poor|_|03 kid|_|01 almost|_|07 died|_|01 . i mean|_|04 why ? for nothing|_|01 . because of a stupid|_|01 fan|_|01 rivalry|_|03 ? what do you guys|_|01 think|_|02 ? agree|_|01 or disagree|_|02 ? i ca|_|01 n't see|_|02 how you could take|_|06 a different|_|01 stance|_|01 on it , but just for kicks|_|04 and giggles|_|01 . i mean|_|04 i 'm all for sports|_|04 and stuff|_|05 but if you get|_|04 out of control|_|02 and you hurt|_|02 someone|_|01 , that 's on you . this is supposed|_|02 to be fun|_|02 . these games|_|11 are n't supposed|_|02 to be violent|_|03 , and continued|_|02 behavior|_|01 along|_|05 these lines|_|01 could damage|_|01 the reputation|_|01 of the game|_|11 , the fans|_|01 , and the organization|_|05 . i do n't condone|_|06 it at all and i do n't think|_|02 that you should either|_|01 . so there you go|_|01 , that 's that . there you go|_|01 . that 's that . there .
trump|_|02 is a completely|_|01 terrible|_|01 president|_|02 . do n't you agree|_|01 ? he 's done nothing|_|01 for the country|_|04 , it 's no wonder|_|02 that he 's gone|_|03 down so far|_|05 in the polls|_|05 . anyone who supports|_|03 him better|_|01 comment|_|01 so i can unfriendly|_|03 you right|_|07 now . it 's ridiculous|_|03 . if you support|_|03 him , you support|_|03 racism|_|02 , homophobia|_|01 , xenophobia|_|01 , divisiveness , and hate|_|01 .
hey just wanted|_|02 to write|_|02 you a note|_|01 and see|_|08 if you have been watching|_|08 the news|_|01 . they are reporting|_|02 finding|_|02 a mass|_|02 grave|_|01 near|_|07 mosul|_|01 of 100|_|01 dead|_|16 bodies|_|09 most of them decapitated|_|01 and some thirty|_|01 three|_|02 thousand|_|01 people|_|03 that is displaced|_|02 . that is terrible|_|02 . we need|_|02 to do something . the us|_|01 is setting|_|01 up service|_|09 centers|_|03 families|_|08 which is a great|_|03 idea|_|06 .
gr the great|_|01 barrier|_|03 reef|_|01 . i read|_|06 an article|_|04 that stated|_|02 that it was on life|_|05 support|_|06 . that the beaching|_|01 incident|_|02 of two|_|01 thousand|_|01 sixteen|_|01 among st others things|_|12 have left|_|12 it close|_|01 to death|_|04 . the gr covers|_|01 1400miles and has 70000 jobs|_|02 hanging|_|12 in the balance|_|01 . its crazy|_|01 because this thing|_|12 is 25|_|01 million|_|01 yer old|_|01 . we have to do something .
hey just wanted|_|05 to write|_|10 you a quick|_|06 note|_|07 . i saw|_|01 on the news|_|01 today|_|02 a women|_|01 pushed|_|11 another|_|01 women|_|01 into the train|_|05 tracks|_|07 at the midtown manhattan|_|02 subway|_|01 station|_|01 yesterday|_|01 . what is going|_|01 on with people|_|01 ? the police|_|01 dint|_|01 have a motive|_|01 yet|_|01 . the authorities|_|07 said|_|01 approx 24|_|01 people|_|01 per year|_|03 are killed|_|01 on the tracks|_|07 but its usually|_|01 accidental|_|01 .
i feel|_|05 like|_|02 aleppo|_|01 is a legit war|_|01 zone|_|04 right|_|07 now . you can get|_|24 killed|_|02 anywhere|_|01 at anytime . i feel|_|05 so sorry|_|01 about the innocent|_|04 families|_|01 and children|_|03 that are involved|_|05 and would like|_|02 other nations|_|04 to at least|_|01 help|_|01 syria|_|01 and other middle|_|04 eastern|_|01 countries|_|04 and accept|_|02 refugees|_|01 . the thought|_|01 of losing|_|03 your child|_|03 or someone|_|01 in your family|_|01 is really|_|01 disturbing|_|01 .
" i blame|_|03 reality|_|03 tv|_|01 , for all of the crazy|_|03 people|_|01 doing anything to get|_|07 attention|_|04 these days|_|07 . apparently|_|01 a man|_|08 was bit|_|01 by a snake|_|05 , after trying|_|01 to take|_|19 a selfish|_|01 . people|_|01 today|_|02 are so interested|_|01 in themselves , and selfless|_|01 , and social|_|04 media|_|02 , that they often|_|03 miss|_|05 the real|_|03 world|_|08 around|_|04 them . this man|_|08 was literally|_|02 bit|_|01 by a snake|_|05 , and still|_|01 posted|_|01 the selfish|_|01 , and was more worried|_|01 about how many|_|01 " " likes|_|02 " " he would get|_|07 rather|_|02 than his|_|01 snake|_|05 bite|_|05 . it sets|_|02 a bad|_|09 example|_|01 for kids|_|01 , all of these " " challenges|_|03 " " their doing . and , walking|_|10 down the street|_|05 , paying|_|10 more attention|_|04 to their phones|_|01 , than the road|_|02 . "
when you are a police|_|01 officer|_|01 there is a high|_|01 chance|_|01 you 'll get|_|02 shot|_|04 , this kind|_|01 of thing|_|01 happens|_|02 because people|_|01 have an easy|_|11 access|_|04 to guns|_|01 , if there was a more strict|_|03 gun|_|02 control|_|05 , less|_|03 officers|_|01 would die|_|05 during their service|_|07 , but well|_|12 , the government|_|01 prefer|_|01 guns|_|01 over people|_|01 's lives|_|01 . poor|_|01 officers|_|01 , but they had a risky|_|09 job|_|01 .
poor|_|01 people|_|03 , i feel|_|01 bad|_|01 for the family|_|01 they left|_|12 behind|_|01 and for their friends|_|03 and family|_|01 , my deepest|_|07 condolences|_|01 to their relatives|_|01 . it was an accident|_|02 and there was nothing|_|01 that could be done to preven it , but i hope|_|03 this serves|_|01 as lesson|_|04 to other to be more careful|_|01 while engaging|_|03 in that kind|_|01 of activities|_|01 .
my tears|_|04 and rage|_|04 will do nothing|_|01 to ever|_|03 change|_|06 the mind|_|05 and heart|_|10 of a person|_|03 who is , i believe|_|01 , morally|_|02 beyond|_|03 the point|_|20 of return|_|11 . but i can not stop|_|05 these tears|_|04 from pouring|_|06 down my cheeks|_|02 as i wonder|_|03 what the f**k is wrong|_|01 with our society|_|04 . p.s. since the report|_|03 on this cruel|_|01 incident|_|02 is only available|_|03 in my first|_|02 language|_|01 , afrikaans|_|01 , and on the website|_|01 network24 where one|_|02 has to be a paying|_|05 subscriber|_|02 to access|_|03 their news|_|01 articles|_|02 , i am including|_|03 a short|_|06 video|_|01 uploaded|_|01 by the young|_|01 farmer|_|01 herself .
" it is a sad|_|02 world|_|01 when lives|_|13 are threatened|_|03 daily|_|01 . let|_|02 's remember|_|02 when we here in america|_|01 were fighting|_|03 each other during the civil|_|02 war|_|04 . war|_|04 is hell|_|06 whether you are on the " " right|_|04 " " side|_|09 or the " " wrong|_|07 " " side|_|09 . both sides|_|09 invariably|_|01 lose|_|01 something . does it make|_|01 sense|_|03 to have war|_|04 ? is it a human|_|03 condition|_|03 that we will never|_|02 be able|_|03 to contain|_|11 ? i know|_|10 these are open|_|02 ended|_|01 questions|_|01 but are we like|_|02 the herds|_|01 of animals|_|01 that migrate|_|02 and take|_|03 over others ' territories|_|02 when food|_|01 and water|_|06 are needed|_|01 . i believe|_|01 we can be better|_|01 by accepting|_|20 our differences|_|01 and finding|_|05 common|_|02 ground|_|04 for the welfare|_|01 of all . "
so there were the guys|_|03 who were basically|_|01 mad|_|02 the government|_|01 made|_|02 local|_|03 land|_|04 into a wildlife|_|01 refuge|_|02 . they went|_|04 as far|_|01 as getting|_|02 a militia|_|02 together|_|03 . they had guns|_|02 and were watching|_|08 . they had a whole|_|15 group|_|02 of them involved|_|01 . the problem|_|01 is they shot|_|04 and killed|_|07 someone|_|01 . can you say|_|01 it went|_|04 to far|_|01 ? i do . i think|_|01 the whole|_|15 thing|_|01 was a bit|_|02 much|_|01 . i mean|_|01 they just took|_|01 over the federal|_|01 land|_|04 . you ca|_|01 n't just do that no matter|_|01 what you stand|_|04 for .
the story|_|01 that was told|_|03 in the article|_|04 that i read|_|06 was i thought|_|10 was pretty|_|01 sad|_|02 considering|_|01 it highlighted|_|02 a better|_|12 time|_|06 in life|_|02 where things|_|09 were not so violent|_|02 in the world|_|01 . there are so many|_|01 acts|_|02 of terror|_|04 these days|_|01 that it is hard|_|01 to keep|_|04 track|_|11 of and the incident|_|02 described|_|02 feels|_|02 the same way|_|01 . unfortunately|_|01 there are so many|_|01 bad|_|01 people|_|01 in this world|_|01 that feel|_|05 like|_|04 they should be able|_|02 to do all these bad|_|01 things|_|09 to other people|_|01 because of some message|_|02 they are trying|_|01 to spread|_|02 but really|_|01 just causing|_|02 a lot|_|05 of pain|_|02 for everyone .
there are so many|_|01 instances|_|01 of shootings|_|02 and mass|_|03 murdering|_|01 happening|_|02 around|_|04 the world|_|01 today|_|02 and the example|_|01 brought|_|03 up in the article|_|04 like|_|02 the orlando|_|01 shooting|_|02 just shows|_|01 how there is a culture|_|02 these days|_|07 where people|_|01 just do n't care|_|02 anymore|_|01 . more and more people|_|01 find|_|02 it okay|_|01 to take|_|01 the lives|_|07 of innocent|_|07 people|_|01 for their own screwed|_|01 up agenda|_|02 , whatever|_|01 that is so that they can show|_|01 that they have control|_|05 over the situation|_|02 . i think|_|13 a huge|_|01 problem|_|01 here is gun|_|01 laws|_|01 and there should definitely|_|01 be some sort|_|02 of change|_|01 that occurs|_|01 .
video|_|01 shows|_|03 cop|_|05 punching|_|01 woman|_|02 in the face|_|04 , but she ’s the one|_|01 arrested|_|02 for ‘ assault|_|03 ’ — a uniformed|_|01 arizona|_|01 police|_|01 officer|_|01 who was filmed|_|02 punching|_|03 a woman|_|02 has been placed|_|01 on administrative|_|01 leave|_|02 while the incident|_|02 is investigated|_|02 . “ our agency|_|01 is very concerned|_|02 by what is depicted|_|02 in this video|_|01 , ” police|_|01 in flagstaff|_|01 , arizona|_|01 , said|_|01 in a wednesday|_|01 evening|_|01 press|_|01 release|_|01 . the footage|_|01 , shot|_|01 and posted|_|01 to facebook on wednesday|_|01 , shows|_|08 a woman|_|02 struggling|_|02 with two|_|01 officers|_|01 who apparently|_|01 believe|_|01 there is an outstanding|_|02 warrant|_|02 for her arrest|_|02 . she can be heard|_|02 on video|_|01 saying|_|01 the issue|_|01 has already|_|01 been resolved|_|02 . “ you can not arrest|_|01 me until i know|_|05 i have a warrant|_|02 , ” she tells|_|02 the officers|_|01 as she struggles|_|02 with them . suddenly|_|01 , one|_|05 of them strikes|_|07 her in the face|_|04 with a closed|_|01 fist|_|01 . authorities|_|01 have see|_|01 .
are you looking|_|02 for an informative|_|01 , creative|_|02 and interesting|_|01 article|_|04 to read|_|03 ? just for fun|_|02 or educational|_|02 purposes|_|02 ? then this the article|_|04 for you . this article|_|04 is really|_|01 interesting|_|01 . the author|_|01 explains|_|02 things|_|12 in away|_|04 that anyone can understand|_|03 them . the author|_|01 's use|_|02 of language|_|01 is genius|_|04 and very interesting|_|01
i feel|_|05 so bad|_|01 for val , he is battling|_|01 this disease|_|01 and people|_|01 are dwelling|_|01 on the fact|_|04 he may|_|01 die|_|05 soon|_|01 . i think|_|01 douglas|_|01 cares|_|02 for val , however|_|04 , he should not make|_|43 public|_|02 comments|_|02 regarding|_|05 val 's condition|_|06 , that is very intrusive|_|03 to val , and i feel|_|05 anger|_|02 towards michael|_|01 for being so rude|_|04 and invading|_|04 towards val 's condition|_|06 .
so many|_|01 priests|_|02 murdered|_|01 in mexico|_|01 in the last|_|04 10|_|01 years|_|03 . i do n't know|_|01 that i would have the courage|_|01 to protest|_|03 anything if my land|_|02 was controlled|_|05 by drug|_|01 cartels|_|04 , who surely|_|01 do not care|_|02 about anyone else|_|03 other than themselves . it takes|_|02 courage|_|01 to be an activist|_|01 , but i think|_|01 i could do more good|_|13 by staying|_|04 alive|_|01 and picking|_|05 my fights|_|05 wisely|_|01 .
i am rather|_|01 turned|_|01 off by the fact|_|04 that california|_|01 allows|_|01 the water|_|02 supply|_|02 to be so construed|_|01 for people|_|01 . very sad|_|02 to see|_|01 people|_|01 in central|_|02 california|_|01 go|_|01 through what flint|_|03 , michigan|_|01 went|_|01 through with poor|_|04 water|_|02 conditions|_|05 and i 'd hate|_|01 to be in the political|_|03 sphere|_|06 there . it would be good|_|17 to see|_|01 organizations|_|01 working|_|27 within|_|02 the region|_|04 to bring|_|02 residents|_|01 quality|_|02 water|_|02 .
this is surprising|_|01 news|_|01 . first|_|01 , how the news|_|01 always|_|04 make|_|02 us|_|01 believe|_|01 that when a cop|_|05 dies|_|01 , is because of a black|_|04 person|_|01 ( or someone|_|01 who is not white|_|07 ) , making|_|02 race|_|03 a big|_|01 thing|_|09 again . number|_|01 two|_|01 , i am not saying|_|01 that is good|_|01 that people|_|01 are dead|_|01 , but instead|_|01 , i am saying|_|01 that not a lot|_|05 of them are dead|_|01 . and for those who are not dead|_|01 , we should think|_|01 about them , provide|_|06 them with better|_|01 guide|_|03 , counseling|_|02 and stuff|_|01 like|_|02 that , they go|_|01 through traumatic|_|02 events|_|02 at work|_|02
i just read|_|06 about some girls|_|05 losing|_|01 their parents|_|01 . it was very bad|_|01 . they went|_|03 to a theme|_|02 park|_|01 to enjoy|_|04 themselves and their parents|_|01 were killed|_|09 in front|_|04 of them . it was a water|_|03 ride|_|02 , the kind|_|01 that seats|_|07 six|_|01 at a time|_|03 . something mechanical|_|03 happened|_|03 on the ride|_|02 . the maintenance|_|06 check|_|02 a few days|_|01 prior|_|02 was good|_|13 , but something screwed|_|02 up . there were four|_|01 adults|_|02 and two|_|04 girls|_|05 . the ride|_|02 flipped|_|01 over and trapped|_|04 the adults|_|02 . the little|_|02 girls|_|05 somehow|_|02 escaped|_|01 , but their parents|_|01 were among the four|_|01 dead|_|02 . apparently|_|01 , the park|_|01 workers|_|02 did n't even|_|01 notice|_|01 it right|_|07 away|_|01 . one|_|01 of the girls|_|05 was by the ride|_|02 exit|_|01 by herself . the girls|_|05 may|_|01 need|_|01 a lot|_|04 of counseling|_|02 for the rest|_|01 of the lives|_|01 . it was pretty|_|01 bad|_|01 . i would hate|_|01 to see|_|01 my family|_|02 members|_|01 die|_|01 in front|_|04 of me in a tragic|_|01 accident|_|02 like|_|02 that .
in moldovan|_|01 , the lady|_|03 running|_|11 for president|_|02 is being discriminated|_|02 against in a very public|_|02 way|_|06 . they are saying|_|01 just because she 's not married|_|02 , she is unqualified|_|02 to lead|_|03 the country|_|04 . they care|_|02 more about her personal|_|04 business|_|09 than her politics|_|05 . it 's a shame|_|02 they are acting|_|03 so backwards|_|02 toward her . it makes|_|48 me want|_|01 to cheer|_|05 for her just to spite|_|05 them . i hope|_|02 the rest|_|04 of the world|_|01 catches|_|03 up to the idea|_|03 everyone should be treated|_|08 equally|_|01 .
i am really|_|01 shocked|_|01 by our current|_|01 health|_|02 care|_|06 system|_|05 . i just read|_|06 an article|_|04 that informed|_|01 me that something as simple|_|01 of hand|_|01 washing|_|02 can prevent|_|02 hundreds|_|01 of deaths|_|04 and disability|_|01 for us|_|01 infants|_|01 . why is n't this common|_|02 knowledge|_|01 . i am really|_|01 disappointed|_|02 . it may|_|01 not be a majority|_|03 of children|_|02 who are at - risk|_|02 or afflicted|_|01 , but for the few children|_|02 who are , this information|_|02 would have been everything .
i just read|_|05 a story|_|02 about the tragic|_|01 deaths|_|01 that occurred|_|01 as a result|_|02 of the terrorist|_|01 group|_|01 in 2015 in paris|_|04 . it was gruesome|_|01 to hear|_|02 one|_|01 man|_|08 's account|_|02 of the story|_|02 . he said|_|01 the shootings|_|02 went|_|05 on for 3|_|01 hours|_|02 , and when stopped|_|04 , it was only so they could load|_|05 more ammunition|_|01 and fire|_|08 more . i could n't help|_|01 but think|_|05 about the people|_|01 out in the crowd|_|01 who where hit|_|02 and killed|_|01 . it 's disturbing|_|11 just imagining|_|02 that scene|_|01 and the terror|_|04 . and then one|_|01 man|_|08 , george|_|07 salines|_|01 , got|_|14 a call|_|01 no one|_|01 would want|_|05 . that his|_|01 daughter|_|01 was among the 130|_|01 killed|_|01 . the loss|_|02 has affected|_|05 his|_|01 whole|_|01 life|_|01 , he left|_|01 his|_|01 job|_|01 and everything . in one|_|01 moment|_|03 , anyone can be affected|_|05 by severe|_|01 tragedy|_|01 .
i think|_|10 this article|_|04 is really|_|01 inspirational|_|01 . i did n't realize|_|08 how much|_|01 food|_|03 we waste|_|01 and how inefficient|_|01 we are in this respect|_|01 . i would like|_|02 to change|_|01 the way|_|11 the world|_|03 behave|_|02 but this would be a big|_|01 undertaking|_|02 and i think|_|10 it may|_|01 be too big|_|01 . there are small|_|02 and big|_|01 things|_|08 that we can do with our daily|_|01 meals|_|02 and meal|_|02 planning|_|03 that can help|_|01 with this problem|_|01 of food|_|03 waste|_|02 but i think|_|10 it will take|_|02 more time|_|02 and money|_|03 to implement|_|01 it . and mi|_|02 not sure|_|07 what percentage|_|01 it will get|_|02 us|_|01 towards 0|_|01 % waste|_|02 . if it gets|_|02 us|_|01 less|_|01 than 1|_|01 % more efficiency|_|02 in how we use|_|01 food|_|03 , than it may|_|01 not be worth|_|01 the effort|_|02 , and we may|_|01 need|_|03 to look|_|02 at other ideas|_|01 . combating|_|01 food|_|03 waste|_|02 could also|_|02 lead|_|03 to an increase|_|02 it food|_|03 poisoning|_|03 since questionable|_|02 foods|_|03 in our refrigerator|_|01 are thrown|_|01 away|_|01 as a precaution|_|02 .
hi|_|01 ! what do you think|_|02 of this ? i know|_|01 you hate|_|01 the pipeline|_|02 as much|_|01 as i do . wonder|_|02 if this would have a chance|_|03 of working|_|03 ? we all know|_|01 money|_|03 is more important|_|05 than human|_|03 life|_|02 , unfortunately|_|01 . i 'm skeptical|_|01 , but then again , nothing|_|01 has worked|_|03 so far|_|05 , so why would this ? i do n't know|_|01 what to think|_|02 . i do n't have any actions|_|10 i could take|_|05 at this point|_|01 , anyway|_|01 .
hey . i just read|_|06 an article|_|04 about somali|_|01 refugees|_|01 in america|_|01 and i had many|_|01 thoughts|_|01 . i understand|_|01 where these refugees|_|01 are coming|_|04 from . having to leave|_|08 their home|_|01 and come|_|04 to a foreign|_|01 country|_|04 where they do n't know|_|01 many|_|01 people|_|03 and having others not want|_|01 you there . i understand|_|01 that they had to leave|_|08 their home|_|01 country|_|04 because of whatever|_|01 issues|_|02 the country|_|04 was having but i wonder|_|02 if these refugees|_|01 could try|_|06 a bit|_|10 harder|_|01 . it 's hard|_|01 to come|_|04 here as an immigrant|_|01 and i 'm sure|_|07 way|_|01 more harder|_|01 to come|_|04 as a refugee|_|01 but taking|_|06 initiatives|_|01 to push|_|11 forward|_|01 and somehow|_|01 make|_|02 it work|_|03 would be the best|_|03 thing|_|08 possible|_|01 . it did make|_|02 me feel|_|05 sad|_|02 for them . i wondered|_|02 if it 's possible|_|01 to give|_|01 them more aid|_|01 based|_|01 on working|_|03 or something to reward|_|03 them for being a member|_|01 of society|_|02 .
i always|_|02 feel|_|06 soft|_|01 heated|_|01 when i read|_|06 about the holocaust|_|01 . to imagine|_|01 going|_|01 through that experience|_|02 and just knowing|_|05 that there are people|_|03 that evil|_|01 makes|_|08 me angry|_|01 and sad|_|01 . but to see|_|01 people|_|03 try|_|01 to make|_|08 something positive|_|09 out of something so negative|_|03 makes|_|08 me happy|_|02 . also|_|02 i feel|_|06 that it 's so great|_|03 to remember|_|07 those who died|_|05 without ever|_|01 living|_|05 their lives|_|05 .
did you hear|_|02 about this kid|_|01 who lost|_|01 his|_|01 leg|_|01 because a teacher|_|02 body|_|02 slammed|_|01 him ? obviously|_|01 i do n't know|_|07 what exactly|_|03 happened|_|04 but from the news|_|01 report|_|01 he was acting|_|01 up and the teacher|_|02 decided|_|04 to use|_|01 physical|_|01 restraint|_|02 . supposedly|_|01 in this county|_|02 of georgia|_|03 teachers|_|02 can use|_|01 physical|_|01 restraint|_|02 on students|_|01 if they are disobedient|_|02 and a threat|_|03 to students|_|01 and others . i think|_|01 its safe|_|02 to say|_|01 there was fault|_|06 on all sides|_|09 . the kid|_|01 should of behaved|_|03 himself , the teacher|_|02 should n't probably|_|01 should n't of been as excessive|_|02 and the school|_|06 should of handle|_|02 the whole|_|15 situation|_|02 better|_|01 . what do you think|_|01 ?
it 's amazing|_|01 how much|_|01 destruction|_|06 two|_|01 large|_|06 warring|_|01 nations|_|04 can do to such a smaller|_|02 nation|_|04 . the middle|_|04 east|_|03 was never|_|02 in a position|_|01 of power|_|01 , they have been fighting|_|06 for a millennial|_|01 , but the destruction|_|06 is much|_|05 greater|_|01 now , there has never|_|02 been weaponry|_|01 so large|_|06 and crushing|_|08 to such a small|_|02 state|_|04 nation|_|04 . it 's unbelievable|_|01 that an entire|_|02 generation|_|01 of culture|_|02 will be separated|_|02 from their families|_|01 and can only take|_|34 what they have learned|_|04 so far|_|02 .
the liberal|_|02 left|_|02 has struck|_|13 again . they continue|_|02 to react|_|03 negatively|_|02 to trump|_|02 being president|_|01 even|_|03 18|_|01 months|_|02 after the election|_|04 . this whole|_|02 thing|_|01 about getting|_|02 an iud|_|01 now because trump|_|02 will make|_|03 birth|_|01 control|_|02 affordable|_|01 in the near|_|01 future|_|01 is ridiculous|_|02 . just another|_|01 issue|_|04 to get|_|02 people|_|01 stirred|_|03 up . most trump|_|03 supporters|_|01 are conservative|_|02 when it comes|_|04 to economic|_|05 issues|_|04 but moderately|_|01 liberal|_|02 when it concerns|_|02 social|_|04 issues|_|04 . big|_|12 changes|_|01 in birth|_|01 control|_|02 , same sex|_|03 marriages|_|02 , abortion|_|01 , and women|_|02 ’s rights|_|04 are not going|_|01 to happen|_|01 . i would like|_|02 to ask|_|02 the haters|_|01 how their lives|_|01 have changed|_|01 for the worse|_|01 since the election|_|04 !
i did n't realize|_|08 there are still|_|04 a lot|_|02 of haitians|_|01 who are suffering|_|06 badly|_|08 since the quakes|_|01 years|_|03 ago|_|01 . it seems|_|02 a large|_|01 amount|_|01 of them have made|_|03 their way|_|02 to brazil|_|01 and central|_|02 america|_|02 to try|_|01 to get|_|01 work|_|01 and get|_|01 a better|_|17 life|_|02 . this has turned|_|18 out badly|_|08 for a lot|_|02 of them . they have been victimized|_|03 and injured|_|01 and killed|_|02 by gangs|_|04 and terrible|_|02 conditions|_|05 on their way|_|02 to try|_|01 to get|_|01 to america|_|02 . when they do make|_|03 it they are often|_|03 given|_|18 a court|_|05 date|_|06 to appear|_|02 at some future|_|03 date|_|06 . because of immigration|_|02 policies|_|03 many|_|01 of them are suffering|_|06 .
president|_|01 trump|_|02 is so stupid|_|01 for pulling|_|17 out of the paris|_|04 deal|_|06 . being that our country|_|04 is held|_|23 highly|_|01 among - st the rest|_|07 of the world|_|01 , you would think|_|10 that we would be considered|_|05 with the environment|_|02 just as much|_|01 as everyone else|_|03 . how can he believe|_|01 climate|_|02 change|_|03 is n't real|_|03 how is he allowed|_|01 to just pull|_|17 us|_|01 from this deal|_|06 we agreed|_|01 to ? it seems|_|04 pretty|_|02 stupid|_|01 to me that he can just make|_|02 these changes|_|03 on his|_|01 own free|_|01 will . what happens|_|04 later|_|01 down the road|_|02 when the impact|_|02 of these decisions|_|01 are felt|_|03 and the earth|_|01 really|_|01 does have an angry|_|03 summer|_|02 ?
did you see|_|01 where there was a buss|_|01 crash|_|03 on the highway|_|01 this morning|_|01 ? i do n't think|_|02 anyone got|_|02 badly|_|05 hurt|_|02 , but it just shows|_|02 you how quickly|_|01 things|_|01 can go|_|04 from good|_|13 to bad|_|01 . i hope|_|02 the one|_|02 at fault|_|01 was n't doing something stupid|_|01 like|_|02 testing|_|07 while they were driving|_|02 ! i ca|_|01 n't stand|_|04 those people|_|03 ! well|_|05 , however|_|01 it happened|_|03 , i 'm just glad|_|01 no one|_|02 was seriously|_|01 hurt|_|02 or killed|_|05 .
since i have no children|_|02 and do n't plan|_|02 on having any , i do n't really|_|01 have an opinion|_|01 regarding|_|05 the ease|_|02 that women|_|02 choose|_|03 to have cesarean|_|01 instead|_|01 of natural|_|09 births|_|02 . i do n't think|_|01 my opinion|_|01 would be well|_|01 received|_|13 and i myself know|_|11 i have no experience|_|01 in this . i do believe|_|01 , however|_|04 , that a woman|_|02 should look|_|01 at all available|_|03 options|_|02 and decide|_|01 what is best|_|02 for her and her family|_|04 .
i do n't see|_|02 how things|_|08 are still|_|04 happening|_|04 like|_|02 this in this point|_|01 in time|_|06 . we can not let|_|02 this continue|_|10 . it really|_|01 makes|_|43 me sad|_|02 and fell|_|08 fortunate|_|03 for what i have . it is insane|_|01 that people|_|03 still|_|04 act|_|02 like|_|02 this . maybe|_|01 we should send|_|02 some help|_|02 over there but it might|_|01 not be a good|_|13 idea|_|03 to get|_|02 involved|_|07 and could cause|_|02 worse|_|01 problems|_|01 .

i am sorry|_|01 for this teacher|_|02 who is just trying|_|01 to do his|_|01 best|_|03 in a heated|_|04 political|_|03 moment|_|06 . i have no doubt|_|02 that he was only attempting|_|01 to teach|_|02 to the best|_|03 of his|_|01 ability|_|02 and represent|_|01 facts|_|02 as he always|_|04 has . i wish|_|02 people|_|01 could approach|_|01 each other with more compassion|_|02 in the spirit|_|02 of education|_|01 rather|_|01 than attack|_|06 those who are trying|_|01 to better|_|01 our children|_|04 . i am glad|_|03 to see|_|15 that he received|_|13 some national|_|06 support|_|06 .
it is terrible|_|01 that our political|_|01 system|_|05 is so dysfunctional|_|01 that one|_|01 man|_|08 can cause|_|01 so much|_|01 harm|_|01 around|_|04 the world|_|08 . the result|_|01 of american|_|01 ignorance|_|01 will mean|_|01 a great|_|02 deal|_|06 of pain|_|04 in many|_|01 lives|_|01 , including|_|01 those of our next|_|03 - door|_|04 neighbor|_|01 . i wish|_|01 we valued|_|01 experts|_|01 more such that we could introduce|_|01 policies|_|03 that help|_|01 all people|_|01 -- which is quite|_|02 possible|_|01 . diplomacy|_|01 and politics|_|04 are not a zero|_|04 - sum|_|02 game|_|11 : there are no enemies|_|02 unless we create|_|03 them . all people|_|01 have value|_|04 and choosing|_|01 knee|_|01 - jerk|_|01 hate|_|01 will only harm|_|01 us|_|01 in the long|_|01 run|_|05 .
after reading|_|06 this article|_|04 i realized|_|08 that our country|_|04 is getting|_|01 lazier|_|01 and lazier|_|01 . it does n't surprise|_|02 me when most millennial|_|01 out there feel|_|05 entitled|_|02 to everything . people|_|01 do n't think|_|03 for themselves anymore|_|01 or work|_|01 hard|_|10 for what they want|_|05 . not that people|_|01 lack|_|06 the intelligence|_|01 but that they do n't use|_|01 it . they go|_|01 to college|_|03 , which is hard|_|01 work|_|01 , but then they expect|_|01 a job|_|02 to be handed|_|05 to them . the real|_|03 world|_|08 is n't after high|_|04 school|_|05 , its after college|_|03 .
mosul|_|01 is iraq|_|01 's second|_|02 most populous|_|01 city.a major|_|08 military|_|03 campaign|_|02 launched|_|05 by the iraqi|_|01 government|_|01 forces|_|04 with allied|_|05 militias|_|02 , the intensity|_|02 of the fighting|_|01 and the airstrikes in eastern|_|04 parts|_|01 of the city|_|03 is high|_|01 many|_|01 people|_|01 are killed|_|01 their bodies|_|01 hang|_|03 in the middle|_|01 cities|_|03 not giving|_|44 to the resident|_|01 . the coalition|_|01 strategy|_|02 was reported|_|02 to be to encircle|_|03 mosul|_|01 completely|_|01 , after which iraqi|_|01 troops|_|04 would advance|_|02 into the city|_|03 - center|_|08 . pro|_|02 - government|_|01 fighters|_|02 in the south|_|04 of mosul|_|01 were battling|_|01 pockets|_|07 of isl fighters|_|02 and snipers|_|01 as they tried|_|06 to reclaim|_|02 the village|_|01 of abbas .
" sexual|_|04 assault|_|03 is the major|_|01 problem|_|02 in the country|_|04 there were many|_|01 cases|_|05 first|_|01 , second|_|01 and third|_|01 degree|_|07 reported.the recent|_|01 story|_|02 of the u|_|01 - madison|_|02 student|_|01 who was charged|_|03 in alleged|_|01 attacks|_|05 on 5|_|01 women|_|01 — sexual|_|04 assault|_|03 against a university|_|03 of wisconsin|_|02 student|_|01 led|_|08 to multiple|_|01 charges|_|07 based|_|08 on claims|_|03 from five|_|01 women|_|01 . combined|_|05 with the viral|_|01 nature|_|04 of social|_|06 media|_|02 , has resulted|_|07 in modern|_|05 - day|_|01 character|_|05 assassination|_|01 that is very real|_|03 and very wrong|_|05 .

as i read|_|09 this article|_|04 , i felt|_|03 disturbed|_|01 knowing|_|01 that a sexual|_|04 abuser|_|01 raped|_|07 his|_|01 daughter|_|01 for many|_|01 years|_|03 and the man|_|10 who murdered|_|01 him is getting|_|02 punished|_|01 for finally|_|01 ending|_|04 the torture|_|05 involved|_|05 in the girl|_|02 's life|_|01 . of course|_|04 , murder|_|01 was wrong|_|07 , but what that girl|_|02 's father|_|02 did to her was by far|_|05 more unacceptable|_|04 in my opinion|_|01 .
trump|_|02 and his|_|01 administration|_|01 are horrible|_|03 people|_|01 . i ca|_|01 n't believe|_|01 ( okay|_|01 maybe|_|01 i can ) that they would behave|_|02 like|_|02 that . there is nothing|_|01 wrong|_|07 with lg individuals|_|01 . we need|_|02 more representation|_|01 in this country|_|02 and politicians|_|01 need|_|02 to stop|_|01 pushing|_|02 their backwards|_|02 beliefs|_|01 onto others . lg deserve|_|01 to live|_|01 just as much|_|01 as everyone else|_|03 , and they deserve|_|01 their freedom|_|01 too .
i 'm glad|_|01 i do n't wear|_|09 contacts|_|09 , because i 'm so lazy|_|01 with them that i would likely|_|01 become|_|01 infected|_|04 and that would be horrible|_|03 for my already|_|01 terrible|_|01 eyes|_|05 . i read|_|05 an article|_|04 that said|_|01 that people|_|01 who leave|_|03 their contacts|_|09 in while they sleep|_|02 are more likely|_|01 to get|_|02 an eye|_|05 infection|_|03 that can cause|_|02 blindness|_|01 . makes|_|02 me wish|_|02 i could fix|_|02 my vision|_|01 to perfection|_|03 again . i hate|_|01 that i have terrible|_|01 eyesight|_|01 and have to rely|_|01 on primitive|_|04 glasses|_|01 or risky|_|09 contacts|_|09 . it 's not fair|_|01 and i am very upset|_|01 about it . does anyone want|_|01 to donate|_|01 their eyes|_|05 to me ? i promise|_|01 i will take|_|02 good|_|13 care|_|06 of them . if only i could grow|_|01 new|_|05 eyes|_|05 or get|_|02 bad|_|09 ass bionic|_|02 cyborg|_|01 eyes|_|05 that can shoot|_|01 lasers|_|01 , then i could defeat|_|01 the bacteria|_|01 and be a hero|_|02 to the human|_|03 race|_|03 . well|_|05 that 's all silly|_|01 pipe|_|02 dreams|_|01 . i just have to deal|_|02 within|_|02
it 's really|_|01 sad|_|02 that it seems|_|02 that so many|_|01 people|_|03 are ignorant|_|03 when they purchase|_|01 pets|_|01 . people|_|03 should be more dedicated|_|18 to animals|_|01 and the environment|_|02 and if they do n't feel|_|05 prepared|_|01 to take|_|15 care|_|02 of a pet|_|01 then they should just , not get|_|01 one|_|03 . this is why goldfish|_|01 are invading|_|04 australia|_|02 . invasive|_|01 species|_|01 are extremely|_|01 problematic|_|01 to the ecosystem|_|01 and combating|_|01 them is difficult|_|01 and expensive|_|01 .
this is something that the geneva|_|01 convention|_|02 would ban|_|02 from use|_|02 in warfare|_|01 , as it is inhumane|_|01 and immoral|_|01 as a tactic|_|01 . i am very saddened|_|02 by the turmoil|_|02 in the middle|_|01 east|_|05 . often|_|05 i think|_|03 about how we got|_|01 here and why it got|_|01 so bad|_|09 and blame|_|03 the powerful|_|01 and privileged|_|02 countries|_|01 , including|_|03 mine|_|02 , have caused|_|02 these conflicts|_|01 . it feels|_|05 like|_|02 it will never|_|02 end|_|04 , a hopeless|_|04 situation|_|03 . i feel|_|05 powerless|_|01 to help|_|01 anyone over there myself , i can only vote|_|05 here and hope|_|03 for the best|_|03 in the end|_|13 . maybe|_|01 someday|_|01 the people|_|01 over there will be much|_|01 safer|_|02 and happier|_|02 .
crazy|_|03 things|_|05 are happening|_|04 in afghanistan|_|01 still|_|01 ... don't want|_|05 to go|_|01 there anytime soon|_|01 . too unstable|_|05 and too many|_|01 people|_|03 getting|_|01 kidnapped|_|01 ... and that would certainly|_|01 suck|_|03 . not that i would really|_|01 ever|_|03 want|_|05 to go|_|01 to afghanistan|_|01 in general|_|02 anyway|_|01 . why would you want|_|05 to go|_|01 somewhere|_|01 so dangerous|_|02 ? i do n't understand|_|02 .
it 's interesting|_|01 that so many|_|01 people|_|03 would have this reaction|_|07 to the election|_|04 . sure|_|08 , there 's a lot|_|05 of negative|_|01 stuff|_|05 surrounding|_|01 the election|_|04 and the president|_|02 ... but a lot|_|05 of it is rhetoric|_|04 and media|_|02 . it does n't seem|_|04 as relevant|_|01 on a local|_|03 level|_|07 . i guess|_|02 it would depend|_|01 on where you live|_|02 ... maybe|_|01 i 'm too isolated|_|05 to understand|_|02 .
if you 're here illegally|_|01 , you should n't be here . i do n't have much|_|01 sympathy|_|03 . sure|_|07 , if your parents|_|02 brought|_|01 you here , you did n't have much|_|01 choice|_|01 ... but figure|_|01 out how to be here legally|_|02 . i do n't have much|_|01 sympathy|_|03 for people|_|03 here illegally|_|01 . there are ways|_|11 to do things|_|05 right|_|01 ... and there are rules|_|09 for a reason|_|06 .
this is old|_|01 news|_|04 , really|_|01 . we all know|_|03 trump|_|02 won|_|05 ... and no one|_|02 really|_|01 saw|_|01 it coming|_|02 . no one|_|02 thought|_|01 he could win|_|05 , every|_|01 step|_|03 of the way|_|01 ... and yet|_|04 he did . he 's in office|_|01 ... he 's messing|_|02 things|_|05 up ... whatever|_|01 . we can only hope|_|03 mueller does something and/or that someone|_|01 else|_|03 wins|_|05 in 2020 . i 'm tired|_|01 of hearing|_|02 about it .
i believe|_|01 protecting|_|01 nature|_|03 is extremely|_|01 important|_|01 . whether it is climate|_|02 change|_|02 or restricting|_|03 grazing|_|02 , we must|_|01 make|_|45 a commitment|_|04 to insuring|_|10 that our lands|_|04 are preserved|_|04 for future|_|03 generations|_|01 . people|_|01 can enjoy|_|02 the outside|_|09 and enjoying|_|02 the outside|_|02 is especially|_|01 important|_|01 for a generation|_|01 that has often|_|03 been labeled|_|01 as couch|_|01 potatoes|_|02 . such lands|_|04 should be well|_|08 preserved|_|04 for them .
i never|_|01 knew|_|05 that bananas|_|02 were at risk|_|03 of becoming|_|01 extinct|_|03 . apparently|_|01 we need|_|01 to cultivate|_|01 more varieties|_|01 , so we do not face|_|01 another|_|01 crisis|_|02 like|_|02 cavendish|_|01 and big|_|01 mike|_|01 bananas|_|02 that have succumbed|_|02 to a fungal|_|01 disease|_|01 and almost|_|07 got|_|01 wiped|_|01 out . we are so used|_|01 to seeing|_|02 bananas|_|02 as a common|_|06 fruit|_|03 at supermarkets|_|01 that we never|_|01 think|_|03 of not ever|_|01 eating|_|01 another|_|01 one|_|01 again ! i found|_|01 this article|_|02 very intriguing|_|01 , there is so much|_|01 work|_|05 that goes|_|01 into figuring|_|01 out how to protect|_|02 this yellow|_|05 fruit|_|03 from fungal|_|01 illnesses|_|01 and make|_|03 it more resistant|_|04 to various|_|01 dangerous|_|02 fungal|_|01 strains|_|04 . apparently|_|01 this presents|_|01 a great|_|02 challenge|_|05 for the scientists|_|01 but they are hoping|_|02 to cultivate|_|01 more banana|_|02 plant|_|04 varieties|_|01 that will be more resistant|_|04 to various|_|01 illness|_|01 .
what i learned|_|01 is that one|_|02 of the things|_|12 i learned|_|01 was allah|_|01 is with the patient|_|01 people|_|01 , that only allah|_|01 can protect|_|02 a person|_|01 , that allah|_|01 is the best|_|01 protector|_|01 , good|_|03 and bad|_|01 come|_|02 from him alone|_|02 , that we should depend|_|01 on him for everything , that he will reward|_|02 the believers|_|02 who are suffering|_|05 for having patience|_|04 because allah|_|01 i always|_|04 with the good|_|13 people|_|01 , i believe|_|01 justice|_|02 will be served|_|07 on judgment|_|02 day|_|01 .
hey , this article|_|04 really|_|01 shows|_|12 how people|_|03 can be compassionate|_|01 in even|_|04 the hardest|_|01 places|_|01 to do so . it 's really|_|01 an inspiring|_|02 thing|_|01 for them to do to go|_|01 in and save|_|08 these animals|_|01 even|_|04 in the midst|_|01 of an ongoing|_|01 conflict|_|01 where they could have come|_|04 to harm|_|01 , as well|_|07 as the animals|_|01 . also|_|02 important|_|01 is the situation|_|01 in gaza|_|01 , and other conflict|_|01 zones|_|01 , makes|_|43 it rather|_|01 difficult|_|02 to maintain|_|02 a humanely|_|01 run|_|01 zoo|_|02 , and have veterinarians|_|01 on hand|_|06 in case|_|02 the animals|_|01 become|_|03 ill|_|05 .
i kind|_|01 of think|_|01 this article|_|04 was written|_|07 in a tongue|_|04 - in - cheek|_|02 manner|_|03 especially|_|01 when you read|_|03 that last|_|01 line|_|22 -- what a pun|_|01 ! if there is any truth|_|01 to it , though|_|01 , what could possible|_|01 cause|_|02 these kinds|_|01 of chemical|_|01 burns|_|03 on a shampoo|_|01 product|_|04 that should be thoroughly|_|01 tested|_|07 when mixed|_|01 with water|_|01 in the shower|_|06 . how could it even|_|01 happen|_|02 like|_|02 that ? is there actual|_|03 lye|_|01 in these bottles|_|03 ? i guess|_|02 we 'll find|_|02 out when the case|_|01 goes|_|01 to trial|_|02 .
ember|_|01 when kim guardianship|_|02 was attacked|_|06 in paris|_|04 ? i just read|_|03 another|_|01 famous|_|01 person|_|01 , millikan|_|01 sheratan was tear|_|05 gassed|_|01 and beaten|_|02 :( it is so sad|_|02 you can not feel|_|04 safe|_|02 anywhere|_|01 ! i am glad|_|03 she is outspoken|_|01 and is bringing|_|01 awareness|_|01 to this whole|_|01 ordeal|_|02 . i feel|_|04 so bad|_|09 for all these people|_|01 just minding|_|02 their own business|_|01 and being attacked|_|06 .
kind|_|01 of cool|_|01 that researchers|_|01 have found|_|10 that bonbons|_|01 tend|_|03 to become|_|01 farsighted|_|02 as they age|_|01 , which is quite|_|03 similar|_|04 to humans|_|02 . they also|_|02 observed|_|09 their grooming|_|01 practices|_|04 . some even|_|03 take|_|01 turns|_|04 grooming|_|05 one|_|05 another|_|01 , which is pretty|_|02 cool|_|01 . the article|_|02 was extremely|_|01 hard|_|01 to read|_|05 and understand|_|01 , especially|_|01 with it being written|_|08 in one|_|05 giant|_|01 block|_|01 , so those are really|_|01 the only key|_|01 points|_|20 i got|_|01 from it .
did you hear|_|02 about jose fernandez ? he just died|_|01 in a boating|_|01 accident|_|02 . he was only 24|_|01 years|_|03 old|_|01 ! it 's just so shocking|_|01 and sad|_|02 . what a waste|_|01 ! he was with two|_|01 other men|_|01 too , all in their twenties|_|01 . hose|_|02 had overcome|_|01 so much|_|01 adversity|_|02 . when he was a child|_|04 in cuba|_|02 , he would only make|_|02 $ 4|_|01 a day|_|01 selling|_|01 tomatoes|_|02 and onions|_|03 . it 's such a shame|_|02 to lose|_|07 such a great|_|01 man|_|01 and great|_|01 ball|_|01 player|_|05 .
it is not new|_|12 story|_|02 that civilian|_|01 were killed|_|05 in american|_|01 based|_|02 operation|_|02 in afghanistan|_|01 and these things|_|05 happened|_|03 in wars|_|01 all the time|_|03 . there is no way|_|11 to fight|_|03 a war|_|01 without unnecessary|_|01 human|_|03 casualty|_|02 but with proper|_|03 planning|_|03 and intelligent|_|04 this factor|_|01 can be reduce|_|18 to a great|_|01 extend|_|03 i think|_|10 but it harder|_|01 than it look|_|02
friends|_|01 and family|_|01 , this is another|_|01 tragic|_|01 incident|_|02 . this involves|_|02 a troubled|_|01 boy|_|01 who was literally|_|02 body|_|01 slammed|_|01 by a teacher|_|02 . he then was rushed|_|05 to the hospital|_|02 but they could not do much|_|05 for him even|_|03 through all of their best|_|03 efforts|_|01 . in the end|_|01 he had to have his|_|01 leg|_|01 removed|_|01 . this is tragic|_|01 and we should seek|_|01 justice|_|02 for this child|_|02 !
hey , i 'm sending|_|01 you something you might|_|01 find|_|10 of interest|_|01 . i heard|_|02 about this really|_|01 interesting|_|01 study|_|02 regarding|_|01 the relationship|_|01 between mothers|_|01 and middle|_|04 school|_|05 aged|_|01 children|_|02 . i have to say|_|01 the findings|_|01 rang|_|03 true|_|02 to me and brought|_|01 back|_|05 a lot|_|05 of memories|_|01 . middle|_|04 school|_|05 was a miserable|_|01 time|_|06 for me as i struggled|_|02 with some classes|_|08 and often|_|01 felt|_|03 either|_|01 depressed|_|01 or angry|_|01 for no particular|_|04 reason|_|02 . i remember|_|02 feeling|_|05 constantly|_|01 stressed|_|02 over both academics|_|03 and the challenges|_|04 of middle|_|04 school|_|05 social|_|02 life|_|05 with maintaining|_|02 friendships|_|01 , cliques|_|01 , dating|_|03 etc .
" i just read|_|05 a really|_|01 , really|_|01 long|_|01 article|_|04 about the outrageous|_|01 use|_|02 of torture|_|05 by our government|_|02 during the never|_|02 - ending|_|04 , so - called|_|01 " " war|_|02 on terror|_|04 . " " our tax|_|01 dollars|_|03 have been used|_|06 to torture|_|02 detainees|_|01 ( some of them who have been proven|_|01 to be entirely|_|01 innocent|_|07 ) which is a direct|_|09 violation|_|02 of international|_|01 law|_|02 and the us|_|01 constitution|_|01 . those who suffered|_|11 this brutal|_|01 treatment|_|01 are now experiencing|_|03 long|_|01 term|_|03 physical|_|04 and psychological|_|01 problems|_|01 . the government|_|02 has stonewalled|_|01 and tried|_|01 to keep|_|02 the details|_|03 classified|_|04 . "
this is really|_|01 sad|_|02 ! i would think|_|01 there would be a way|_|01 to stop|_|03 this from happening|_|04 . everyone knows|_|01 this is being done , so why could n't they stop|_|03 it . the human|_|03 trafficking|_|01 is a sad|_|02 thing|_|08 and to have them all dying|_|04 try|_|01 to get|_|01 to another|_|01 place|_|01 is sad|_|02 . there must|_|01 be some kind|_|01 of policing|_|01 that could be done wherever|_|01 the people|_|01 are boarding|_|01 these boats|_|01 .
i knew|_|05 trump|_|02 really|_|01 does n't ' believe|_|01 fully|_|01 in the climate|_|02 change|_|01 and that it 's caused|_|01 my human|_|03 actions|_|01 . i think|_|01 he 's putting|_|01 this topic|_|02 on the back|_|05 burner|_|02 since there are more important|_|01 things|_|08 to concentrate|_|01 . i have to say|_|01 i agree|_|01 with him but at some point|_|01 during his|_|01 presidency|_|02 , it should be looked|_|09 at and see|_|05 what kind|_|01 of changes|_|01 , if any need|_|01 to take|_|01 place|_|01 , and then make|_|02 them happen|_|01
corruption|_|01 in corporations|_|07 are an everyday|_|03 occurrence|_|01 . and it seems|_|04 more and more the american|_|02 workers|_|02 are the victims|_|02 of these erroneous|_|01 fat|_|01 cats|_|01 . it 's deplorable|_|02 that the ceo|_|01 gets|_|04 away|_|01 with corporate|_|04 corruption|_|01 and when the conscious|_|03 of the workers|_|02 come|_|04 into play|_|02 , they fire|_|06 and ruin|_|02 their lively|_|05 hood|_|10 . the corporations|_|07 are in league|_|03 with washington|_|04 due|_|02 to the money|_|03 trails|_|02 . when the money|_|03 is taken|_|04 out of politics|_|05 things|_|05 will be better|_|13 .
a cincinnati|_|01 zoo|_|02 had improper|_|03 safety|_|01 regulations|_|01 which led|_|03 to a 3|_|01 year|_|01 old|_|07 boy|_|04 falling|_|30 into a gorilla|_|01 pit|_|06 . this was the chamber|_|04 thing|_|01 everyone was talking|_|02 about years|_|01 ago|_|01 . they ended|_|04 up shooting|_|11 the gorilla|_|01 in an attempt|_|01 to prevent|_|02 the child|_|03 from getting|_|02 hurt|_|02 , but there was a lot|_|07 of uproar|_|01 over whether it was necessary|_|02 or not . it 's a happy|_|04 ending|_|04 for the kid|_|02 but i really|_|01 wish|_|06 both lived|_|01 .
did you hear|_|02 about the guy|_|03 who was the father|_|06 who works|_|14 for the swedish|_|01 government|_|02 ? this guy|_|03 for some unknown|_|03 reason|_|06 contracted|_|04 a flesh|_|02 eating|_|06 bacteria|_|01 disease|_|01 . it took|_|09 them awhile|_|01 to diagnose|_|02 what really|_|01 was wrong|_|02 with him and he had to take|_|09 certain|_|07 surgeries|_|01 in order|_|02 to save|_|08 his|_|01 life|_|05 . he talks|_|02 about how he 's grateful|_|02 to be alive|_|01 but also|_|02 wants|_|03 to live|_|07 in the moment|_|02 to enjoy|_|01 his|_|01 life|_|05 as well|_|13 . it is touching|_|01 news|_|01 and i 'm happy|_|04 that he 's able|_|02 to overcome|_|01 this adversity|_|01 that came|_|21 upon his|_|01 life|_|05 .
i read|_|03 an article|_|04 that linked|_|01 sleep|_|02 disorders|_|01 and strokes|_|10 . it said|_|11 that if a person|_|01 has a sleep|_|02 disorder|_|01 , they are less|_|02 likely|_|01 to recover|_|04 from a stroke|_|10 . the article|_|04 said|_|11 that sleep|_|02 disorder|_|01 were a very serious|_|01 problems|_|01 , and many|_|01 people|_|01 are affected|_|01 . i felt|_|01 upset|_|01 , because i have had insomnia|_|01 so long|_|02 , and it may|_|01 be making|_|43 it more likely|_|01 for me to have serious|_|01 health|_|02 issues|_|01 in the future|_|03 .
you should check|_|10 out this article|_|04 . as i was reading|_|03 i was happy|_|01 that the injuries|_|02 were not worse|_|01 they n|_|03 they were . could you imagine|_|02 being in any sort|_|01 of situation|_|01 like|_|02 this ? it makes|_|02 me feel|_|05 bad|_|01 for people|_|01 with children|_|04 , could you imagine|_|02 letting|_|02 you r|_|01 children|_|04 leave|_|12 every|_|02 day|_|01 and not knowing|_|05 what could happen|_|01 to them ?
" it 's so insane|_|01 that people|_|01 today|_|02 , specifically|_|01 white|_|02 people|_|01 , find|_|03 the need|_|01 to continue|_|04 to discriminate|_|03 against a group|_|01 of people|_|01 that they have already|_|01 tormented|_|02 for hundreds|_|01 of years|_|03 . there is something i call|_|02 " " little|_|03 man|_|08 syndrome|_|02 " " mostly|_|01 referring|_|07 to when short|_|03 men|_|01 feel|_|05 the need|_|01 to overcompensate|_|15 for their height|_|01 by being very aggressive|_|03 and loud|_|01 . the white|_|02 people|_|01 that commit|_|01 these kinds|_|01 of crimes|_|02 suffer|_|03 from a severe|_|06 case|_|08 of little|_|03 man|_|08 syndrome|_|02 . "
it 's scary|_|01 to think|_|03 that even|_|03 somebody|_|01 who is as well|_|01 known|_|11 and guarded|_|02 as kim guardianship|_|02 can still|_|01 be the victim|_|02 of crimes|_|02 like|_|05 this . it 's got|_|02 to be disheartening|_|01 to be kim and know|_|11 you 've spent|_|03 ( most likely|_|01 ) a lot|_|04 of money|_|03 to have security|_|09 with you at all times|_|01 to protect|_|01 you from things|_|09 like|_|05 this , yet|_|01 it still|_|01 happens|_|02 to you . you 'd have to wonder|_|02 just how much|_|04 more one|_|05 can do to protect|_|01 themselves .
holy|_|01 molt|_|01 ! it looks|_|02 as if this trial|_|06 is getting|_|01 out of control|_|02 . i know|_|05 that sensational|_|03 stories|_|03 have a tendency|_|04 to get|_|01 tons|_|01 of attention|_|03 , but i ca|_|01 n't help|_|01 but think|_|01 about the victims|_|02 in these cases|_|06 . i mean|_|01 , here is a young|_|01 woman|_|02 , whole|_|01 life|_|01 ahead|_|05 , who is inexplicably and disturbingly|_|01 murdered|_|01 . there seems|_|02 to be only circumstantial|_|01 evidence|_|03 against the accused|_|02 and the media|_|03 is overflowing|_|01 the story|_|03 which can really|_|01 detract|_|07 from finding|_|01 the truth|_|05 ! the victim|_|02 here is being overshadowed|_|03 by the hawker|_|01 phenomenon|_|01 . it 's sad|_|02 . i mean|_|01 , even|_|01 the premise|_|01 sounds|_|01 ... fishy|_|02 ... but instead|_|01 of talking|_|05 about that , it looks|_|02 like|_|02 it 's being sensationalized|_|01 into some media|_|03 circus|_|05 . it 's terrible|_|01 . how can they ever|_|01 get|_|01 to the truth|_|05 if the story|_|03 is corrupted|_|01 and broadcast|_|02 to the whole|_|01 country|_|02 ?
these home|_|01 grown|_|01 terrorists|_|01 are becoming|_|01 more and more of a problem|_|02 . how do we monitor|_|01 better|_|12 people|_|01 who are already|_|01 in this country|_|04 ? stopping|_|01 immigration|_|01 is not going|_|01 to solve|_|01 this problem|_|02 . it is the people|_|01 right|_|07 here in our own country|_|04 who are killing|_|01 each other . that problem|_|02 has to be solved|_|01 ! ! ! how do we keep|_|04 tabs|_|01 on people|_|01 and catch|_|28 them before they kill|_|01 their fellow|_|01 citizens|_|01 ?
i 've been reading|_|06 about the drastic|_|01 increase|_|04 in migrants|_|01 trying|_|01 to get|_|02 from africa|_|01 to europe|_|01 across|_|02 the mediterranean|_|01 sea|_|01 . this year|_|03 has seen|_|17 large|_|11 amounts|_|02 of people|_|03 seeking|_|01 refuge|_|02 in europe|_|01 , and large|_|11 increases|_|04 in fatalities|_|02 for those attempting|_|01 the crossing|_|01 . these people|_|03 are fleeing|_|01 desperate|_|04 conditions|_|05 in hope|_|02 of a better|_|17 life|_|01 and are attempting|_|01 risky|_|09 crossings|_|01 because there are not enough|_|01 safe|_|04 ways|_|05 to migrate|_|02 .
how horrible|_|03 what happened|_|01 on that cruise|_|01 ship|_|01 . i ca|_|01 n't believe|_|01 the crew|_|01 members|_|01 were allowed|_|01 to blatantly|_|01 be homophobic|_|01 to the patrons|_|03 like|_|02 that . they should be sued|_|01 ! i 'm glad|_|03 this came|_|13 to light|_|01 . i hope|_|03 people|_|03 do not patronize|_|02 that business|_|01 again knowing|_|03 their true|_|12 colors|_|01 . it should not have taken|_|06 a death|_|06 for them to come|_|13 around|_|01 .
i just read|_|06 the article|_|04 on the oil|_|01 spill|_|01 . even|_|03 though|_|01 i do agree|_|07 with oil|_|01 digging|_|09 , when things|_|11 go|_|01 wrong|_|02 , it does have severe|_|06 consequences|_|03 . i feel|_|05 mostly|_|01 bad|_|01 for the birds|_|01 and sea|_|01 life|_|10 , which will obviously|_|01 be affected|_|01 . you would think|_|02 with all the money|_|01 these oil|_|01 companies|_|03 profit|_|02 from , they would take|_|06 more safety|_|02 precautions|_|03 , in trying|_|01 to avoid|_|02 accidents|_|02 from happening|_|01 . i know|_|05 the industry|_|01 creates|_|02 a lot|_|02 of jobs|_|01 and most often|_|03 , nothing|_|01 goes|_|01 wrong|_|05 . but when it does , it can be catastrophic|_|01 for the wildlife|_|01 in the area|_|01 and those that live|_|05 in the area|_|01 . or even|_|03 those areas|_|01 that rely|_|01 on tourism|_|01 , if people|_|03 ca|_|01 n’t go|_|01 into the oceans|_|02 or there is oil|_|01 spilling|_|02 onto their beaches|_|01 . not sure|_|04 what the answer|_|02 is , or if there even|_|03 is an answer|_|02 to it . it just makes|_|08 me sad|_|02 to see|_|01 those beautiful|_|02 birds|_|01
it is sad|_|01 that children|_|03 are still|_|03 dying|_|04 from measles|_|01 . according|_|01 to unicef|_|01 , there is a simple|_|07 vaccine|_|01 that can be given|_|03 , which would stop|_|01 children|_|03 from being affected|_|05 . it affects|_|05 most children|_|03 in poor|_|01 countries|_|04 , which is very sad|_|01 . the vaccine|_|01 sin’t that expensive|_|01 and you would think|_|03 that the leaders|_|01 of all countries|_|04 would get|_|02 together|_|03 and do something about this problem|_|01 . it is not just up to the usa|_|01 to stand|_|03 up and do something . these other countries|_|04 ( even|_|03 though|_|01 they are poor|_|01 ) need|_|03 to get|_|02 more educated|_|01 and help|_|01 protect|_|02 their own children|_|03 and citizens|_|01 in their own country|_|04 . it is sad|_|01 that children|_|03 and others have to die|_|04 because we ca|_|01 n’t coordinate|_|01 with each other , to get|_|02 the vaccines|_|01 to those who need|_|03 it most . i feel|_|04 sorry|_|01 for those families|_|01 who have suffered|_|03 the loss|_|04 of a child|_|03 due|_|02
i ca|_|01 n't believe|_|01 what 's going|_|01 on overseas|_|01 . it 's so tragic|_|01 that people|_|03 in the military|_|01 are still|_|04 dying|_|04 in war|_|01 , and for what ? i thought|_|01 they would be gone|_|01 from there by now but they 're not . and there 's still|_|04 issues|_|02 with kidnappings|_|01 and things|_|08 of that nature|_|05 . it 's really|_|01 quite|_|04 shocking|_|01 when you think|_|01 about it .
we really|_|01 do n't think|_|10 of air|_|01 pollution|_|01 all that much|_|01 in most of the country|_|04 , but it seems|_|02 to be significant|_|02 problem|_|01 in certain|_|01 larger|_|01 areas|_|01 . apparently|_|01 india|_|01 is having a lot|_|02 of issues|_|02 with it , and it 's making|_|43 people|_|01 sick|_|01 . it 's really|_|01 sad|_|02 when places|_|07 put|_|01 more emphasis|_|01 on businesses|_|01 than they do on the health|_|02 of the people|_|01 .
so two|_|01 sisters|_|02 were on vacation|_|02 and both died|_|04 . apparently|_|01 fluid|_|05 in the lungs|_|01 but one|_|05 had fluid|_|05 in the brain|_|01 or something like|_|02 that . so sad|_|02 for the family|_|06 . the government|_|02 where they were at is not giving|_|01 the family|_|06 much|_|05 info|_|01 if any at all . it is just weird|_|01 how two|_|01 sisters|_|02 both died|_|04 at the same place|_|01 and by fluid|_|02 in the lungs|_|01 or brain|_|01 .
wow|_|02 - i do n’t know|_|05 what i ’d do in this situation|_|03 . how sad|_|02 for these people|_|01 . they have to leave|_|12 everything behind|_|01 , and they really|_|01 do n’t have a lot|_|05 of options|_|02 . i feel|_|05 really|_|01 sad|_|02 for the children|_|04 . it ’s like|_|02 they have no home|_|09 . what a mess|_|01 . i wish|_|04 the middle|_|04 east|_|01 awns’t so violent|_|03 . i do n’t understand|_|02 all the hate|_|01 .
i read|_|10 that apparently|_|01 a man|_|08 in georgia|_|03 was accused|_|01 of deliberately|_|01 leaving|_|12 his|_|01 son|_|02 in the car|_|01 to die|_|04 from the heat|_|01 . i really|_|01 hope|_|03 he gets|_|01 the death|_|04 penalty|_|01 and they leave|_|12 him in a hot|_|03 car|_|01 just like|_|02 he did to his|_|01 son|_|02 . the world|_|08 is filled|_|01 with evil|_|01 people|_|01 and it was really|_|01 disturbing|_|11 to hear|_|02 this story|_|02 .
police|_|01 officers|_|01 are getting|_|01 out of control|_|02 nowadays|_|01 . i ca|_|01 n't believe|_|01 that there has n't been more action|_|10 taken|_|01 against this officer|_|01 who blatantly|_|01 punched|_|03 a woman|_|02 in the face|_|02 without provocation|_|03 , especially|_|01 since the entire|_|02 incident|_|02 was caught|_|19 on tape|_|02 . it makes|_|02 no sense|_|01 to me that this officer|_|01 has n't been charged|_|17 with assault|_|03 in this case|_|01 .
i feel|_|05 very sorry|_|01 for their entire|_|02 family|_|02 regarding|_|05 the divorce|_|01 . even|_|01 though|_|01 the daughters|_|01 are now adults|_|02 that does n't mean|_|04 they are n't negatively|_|02 affected|_|01 . twenty|_|01 - seven|_|01 years|_|03 is a long|_|01 time|_|03 to be married|_|02 , and i think|_|01 this translates|_|07 to a long|_|01 period|_|01 of healing|_|02 for the parents|_|01 . its not a good|_|13 situation|_|01 . i also|_|02 wonder|_|01 about the impact|_|02 of the divorce|_|01 on the daughters|_|01 ' image|_|01 of the security|_|02 of marriage|_|01 for their own lives|_|01 . it seems|_|02 that the parents|_|01 did try|_|01 for a long|_|01 time|_|03 . i wish|_|06 them well|_|01 .
i was n't sure|_|08 how the story|_|01 would end|_|04 - i know|_|07 that emus|_|02 can get|_|01 aggressive|_|03 ! so glad|_|03 to know|_|07 that the emu|_|02 was docile|_|03 and behaving|_|02 well|_|01 . it seems|_|04 like|_|02 the local|_|03 officials|_|02 were doing their best|_|03 not to excite|_|03 it , that 's gratifying|_|02 to know|_|07 . its actually|_|02 something of a funny|_|02 story|_|01 on the whole|_|01 . i hope|_|01 that this story|_|01 provides|_|01 a good|_|13 model|_|09 for others to follow|_|01 in the event|_|01 of another|_|01 emu|_|02 intervention|_|01 .
i hate|_|01 to hear|_|02 about officers|_|01 getting|_|02 shot|_|09 but news|_|01 spreads|_|10 of officers|_|01 doing illegal|_|01 or corrupt|_|02 things|_|01 all the time|_|02 and that will ultimately|_|01 lead|_|03 to extremists|_|01 who want|_|01 to take|_|06 matters|_|01 into their own hands|_|06 in a revengeful|_|01 way|_|01 . i do n't like|_|02 that part|_|01 of our society|_|02 but it is n't something that is easy|_|03 to combat|_|01 . as long|_|01 as officers|_|01 get|_|02 blasted|_|07 on news|_|01 or the internet|_|01 for illegal|_|01 actions|_|01 , people|_|03 are going|_|01 to look|_|02 for ways|_|01 to retaliate|_|01 . its an extremely|_|01 volatile|_|02 situation|_|01 no matter|_|01 how you look|_|02 at it . i bleed|_|27 for all those affected|_|01 but really|_|01 do n't see|_|05 what we can do as a society|_|02 to prevent|_|02 it .
i just read|_|03 a very interested|_|01 and heart|_|01 touching|_|02 article|_|04 concerning|_|02 haiti|_|01 . it is very sad|_|02 to think|_|03 about the amount|_|02 of suffering|_|03 the haitian|_|01 people|_|03 have gone|_|01 through in the past|_|01 years|_|03 . a lot|_|05 of very sad|_|02 hardships|_|03 , from earthquakes|_|02 destroying|_|04 already|_|01 terrible|_|01 infrastructure|_|02 , to intense|_|01 poverty|_|01 . it makes|_|43 me want|_|05 to help|_|01 the people|_|03 .
this article|_|02 i just read|_|03 is incredibly|_|01 intellectually|_|01 dishonest|_|01 . the notion|_|04 that women|_|02 were somehow|_|02 exiled|_|01 from talking|_|02 points|_|20 and inclusion|_|01 in the trump|_|02 campaign|_|01 is actually|_|04 nauseating|_|03 . this kind|_|01 of narrative|_|01 is truly|_|01 what the modern|_|05 liberal|_|02 exists|_|02 upon . it 's disgusting|_|02 . i 'm not a trump|_|02 fan|_|01 , but mark|_|01 my words|_|02 , this kind|_|01 of crap|_|01 will be the reason|_|06 why he wins|_|05 in 2020 .
i just read|_|08 a story|_|01 about a study|_|01 being done by a new|_|05 university|_|03 of washington|_|05 that was funded|_|01 and the satellite|_|03 data|_|01 from nasa|_|01 , that was about the arctic|_|02 polar|_|02 bears|_|02 . it said|_|11 that the climate|_|02 change|_|06 has been affecting|_|01 the feeding|_|01 and breeding|_|05 of these 19|_|01 polar|_|02 bears|_|02 population|_|04 . it has been having a negative|_|08 impact|_|02 on them . i did not know|_|11 that a polar|_|02 bear|_|02 depends|_|01 on the sea|_|03 ice|_|01 to eat|_|01 . they can not outrun|_|01 their prey|_|02 so the sit|_|01 at the air|_|01 holes|_|01 of the seals|_|01 and when they go|_|01 up to get|_|01 air|_|01 the bear|_|02 will capture|_|04 it to eat|_|01 . the days|_|10 that this ice|_|01 is available|_|03 to the bears|_|02 have shortened|_|04 over the thirty|_|01 - five|_|03 - year|_|03 study|_|01 to almost|_|07 seven|_|01 weeks|_|03 . the study|_|01 shows|_|08 that this is a continuing|_|02 pattern|_|01 . i am really|_|01 worried|_|01 about the outcome|_|01 for these bears|_|02 . it is sad|_|02 to think|_|03 they may|_|01 become|_|02 extinct|_|03 .
just when you think|_|03 you have heard|_|02 enough|_|02 crazy|_|01 donald trump|_|02 stories|_|01 this one|_|06 takes|_|01 the cake|_|03 . i just read|_|03 about a mother|_|01 from fresno|_|01 texas|_|01 who not only kicked|_|07 her elementary|_|02 son|_|02 out of the house|_|07 for voting|_|01 in a mock|_|01 school|_|07 election|_|01 for donald trump|_|02 she also|_|02 videotaped|_|01 it . well|_|05 , of course|_|04 , the video|_|01 went|_|15 viral|_|01 . the fort|_|01 bend|_|01 county|_|02 texas|_|01 sheriff|_|01 's department|_|03 went|_|15 to check|_|10 out the situation|_|03 and the child|_|02 seemed|_|04 to be in good|_|01 health|_|02 . the mother|_|01 made|_|03 the child|_|02 stand|_|12 on the street|_|04 corner|_|04 with a sign|_|01 telling|_|01 why he was kicked|_|07 out of the house|_|07 . the mother|_|01 claims|_|07 now that it was only a joke|_|04 . i hope|_|02 the child|_|02 is not permanently|_|01 scarred|_|01 from this incident|_|02 .
considering|_|05 that since donald trump|_|02 got|_|01 elected|_|02 , there has been a rise|_|01 in reported|_|04 hate|_|01 crimes|_|01 that have turned|_|01 out to be hoaxes|_|03 , i 'd say|_|01 there 's at least|_|01 a fifty|_|01 percent|_|01 chance|_|01 this is a fake|_|02 too . even|_|01 if it 's not , it did n't happen|_|01 to me or anyone i care|_|02 about , and it did n't happen|_|01 anywhere|_|01 near|_|01 where i live|_|01 , so it 's of absolute|_|01 zero|_|01 concern|_|02 to me . nothing|_|01 more to say|_|01 about that , but i know|_|09 i have to fill|_|02 in a certain|_|07 number|_|04 of characters|_|03 .
boring|_|01 . i do n't care|_|02 , again , because it does n't impact|_|01 me or anyone i know|_|05 directly|_|04 . these people|_|01 should move|_|03 . i sure|_|07 as hell|_|01 would n't stay|_|02 there . i do find|_|10 it hilarious|_|01 that this is happening|_|01 in california|_|01 , where they seem|_|02 so concerned|_|01 about every|_|02 possible|_|01 social|_|05 issue|_|06 under the sun|_|01 , especially|_|01 taking|_|02 care|_|02 of people|_|01 who are here illegally|_|01 , yet|_|01 there are parts|_|01 of the state|_|04 where actual|_|04 citizens|_|01 ca|_|01 n't drink|_|01 the water|_|01 like|_|02 they 're living|_|05 in a third|_|01 world|_|01 nation|_|04 . then again , given|_|01 california|_|01 's stated|_|04 desire|_|01 to secede|_|01 , they might|_|01 get|_|02 to live|_|05 their third|_|01 world|_|01 dream|_|05 .
the political|_|03 divide|_|01 in this country|_|01 has only gotten|_|02 worse|_|01 over the years|_|03 . trump|_|02 in particular|_|02 has allow|_|01 a rather|_|02 nasty|_|01 aspect|_|01 of american|_|01 society|_|02 to rise|_|01 to the surface|_|04 and be open|_|05 about their nastiness|_|01 . this means|_|04 that people|_|01 on opposite|_|05 political|_|03 spectrum|_|02 can not see|_|19 eye|_|03 - to - eye|_|03 at all . this makes|_|43 compromise|_|02 even|_|03 worse|_|01 and less|_|02 likely|_|01 to succeed|_|02 .
so i just read|_|06 this horrific|_|02 article|_|02 about women|_|02 in nigeria|_|01 being raped|_|07 by the officials|_|02 that rescued|_|02 them from biko hiram . if you do n't know|_|05 about biko hiram you should really|_|01 look|_|02 them up . these poor|_|01 women|_|02 have no one|_|02 to trust|_|06 . i am shocked|_|02 by what i read|_|06 and feel|_|05 so sorry|_|01 for these people|_|01 . i wish|_|02 there was something we could do that would have real|_|01 impact|_|02 on their lives|_|11 . you must|_|01 read|_|06 this article|_|02 .
" you will not believe|_|01 the crazy|_|01 article|_|04 i just read|_|03 . let|_|01 me tell|_|02 you about it . the article|_|04 was about a man|_|08 who had killed|_|01 himself after killing|_|01 his|_|01 wife|_|01 and the main|_|03 thing|_|08 that was being questioned|_|02 was " " why did he have to die|_|05 ? " " what ? ? ? i do n't understand|_|01 why they are n't looking|_|09 into why he killed|_|01 his|_|01 wife|_|01 since they do n't know|_|01 . its pretty|_|02 easy|_|03 to speculate|_|01 why he killed|_|01 himself . i just do n't even|_|01 know|_|01 what to think|_|01 about this article|_|04 . "
a hiker|_|01 was lost|_|01 in a malaysian|_|01 jungle|_|03 for ten|_|01 days|_|01 . the hiker|_|01 only brought|_|11 enough|_|01 food|_|03 for one|_|05 day|_|01 . he survived|_|01 on bananas|_|02 and berries|_|03 he found|_|01 in the jungle|_|03 . when he was found|_|01 he was covered|_|01 in leaches|_|01 , weak|_|12 , and very disoriented|_|01 . its a miracle|_|02 he survived|_|01 on his|_|01 own for ten|_|01 days|_|01 in the jungle|_|03 . there was no cell|_|04 coverage|_|02 in the part|_|09 of the jungle|_|03 he was in so he could not communicate|_|02 to anyone or ask|_|01 for help|_|02 .
i can not believe|_|01 there is someone|_|01 evil|_|01 enough|_|01 in this world|_|02 to torture|_|02 a poor|_|02 , helpless|_|03 kitten|_|01 this way|_|02 . did you read|_|03 this article|_|04 ? the kitten|_|01 was wrapped|_|03 so tightly|_|02 , it 's little|_|03 legs|_|05 were close|_|01 to it 's face|_|01 . it made|_|08 me cry|_|05 . it is horrifying|_|02 to think|_|10 people|_|01 that are capable|_|03 of this exist|_|02 . anyone that does this is a true|_|01 psychopath|_|01 . what will they do next|_|01 ? murder|_|01 young|_|01 children|_|03 ? anyone that is that cruel|_|01 to animals|_|01 should be punished|_|01 . please|_|03 share|_|01 . we have to raise|_|02 awareness|_|01 .
hello|_|01 ! this is why you follow|_|01 the rules|_|09 at our national|_|01 parks|_|06 ! this is a terrible|_|01 tragedy|_|02 that could have easily|_|03 been avoided|_|01 . i was young|_|04 once , and i did plenty|_|02 of reckless|_|01 things|_|08 . i understand|_|02 , maybe|_|01 the boy|_|04 was just trying|_|01 to check|_|10 the temperature|_|01 . maybe|_|01 he did n't believe|_|01 the signs|_|01 , or he thought|_|05 it would be cool|_|02 to do what no one|_|02 else|_|03 has done . his|_|01 poor|_|01 sister|_|03 ! to see|_|01 that happen|_|02 ! to see|_|01 her own brother|_|02 boil|_|01 to death|_|01 . i ca|_|01 n't imagine|_|02 how gruesome|_|01 that must|_|01 have been . i just ca|_|01 n't believe|_|01 they could n't get|_|14 his|_|01 body|_|09 until the next|_|02 day|_|01 ... and the next|_|02 day|_|01 it was gone|_|05 ! this is a huge|_|01 lesson|_|01 for anyone that is young|_|04 and reckless|_|01 !
so , i was reading|_|03 recently|_|01 about how kenya|_|01 deported|_|01 a south|_|05 sudan|_|02 opposition|_|01 official|_|02 . despite|_|02 threats|_|03 against him , they deported|_|01 him as tensions|_|06 rose|_|01 over peacekeeping|_|01 efforts|_|01 . kenyan|_|01 authorities|_|06 have reacted|_|02 super|_|03 angrily|_|01 to a u.n. decision|_|02 this week|_|01 to dismiss|_|11 the kenyan|_|01 general|_|03 in charge|_|04 of the peacekeeping|_|01 force|_|01 there , for failing|_|11 to protect|_|02 civilians|_|01 during a recent|_|01 outbreak|_|01 of violence|_|01 .
the islamic|_|01 state|_|06 is now desperately|_|02 using|_|03 human|_|03 shields|_|02 to try|_|01 and deter|_|01 our attacks|_|09 against them . this is a strategy|_|02 that is doomed|_|03 to failure|_|07 for multiple|_|01 reasons|_|02 , the biggest|_|13 being the civilians|_|01 they are using|_|03 are n't going|_|01 to tolerate|_|10 that shit|_|01 forever|_|02 , and will probably|_|01 start|_|09 resisting|_|02 and escaping|_|01 . the next|_|03 biggest|_|13 , america|_|01 does n't really|_|01 show|_|08 restraint|_|01 when they want|_|05 to bomb|_|02 a target|_|01 and civilians|_|01 are present|_|01 . i mean|_|03 , we generally|_|01 go|_|01 out of our way|_|11 to not blow|_|01 up the nearby|_|01 children|_|02 's hospital|_|02 , but the second|_|01 we suspect|_|03 bin|_|01 leiden|_|01 's cousin|_|01 is in there 7000 drones|_|01 start|_|09 swarming|_|01 .
i think|_|10 issues|_|02 like|_|02 basic|_|02 income|_|01 , universal|_|03 health|_|01 care|_|02 , and right|_|07 to assisted|_|01 dying|_|04 are way|_|11 more important|_|01 . my interest|_|01 in being fit|_|02 or healthy|_|01 is the reduction|_|03 of painful|_|01 symptoms|_|01 . when i eat|_|06 sugar|_|01 , crabs|_|01 , and enriched|_|01 flour|_|01 foods|_|03 , my legs|_|05 hurt|_|04 , my back|_|03 hurts|_|04 , my stomach|_|04 digestion|_|02 goes|_|03 very bad|_|13 , and i get|_|19 heartburn|_|01 . for me , it 's not so much|_|01 about being fat|_|01 or not , it 's about reducing|_|01 pain|_|01 .
i think|_|03 the process|_|06 of dying|_|01 can contain|_|02 various|_|02 levels|_|07 of trauma|_|01 . some people|_|01 die|_|01 with less|_|03 pain|_|02 , and we tend|_|02 to call|_|03 them lucky|_|01 . i tend|_|02 to think|_|03 the body|_|03 inflicts|_|01 various|_|02 levels|_|07 of physical|_|02 and psychological|_|01 pain|_|02 over the often|_|03 somewhat|_|01 lengthy|_|01 process|_|06 of dying|_|01 . one|_|01 type|_|06 of emotion|_|01 i can partly|_|01 relate|_|01 to is the idea|_|01 that the party|_|04 ( life|_|01 ) keeps|_|02 going|_|01 on , but you have to leave|_|02 . the idea|_|01 of no longer|_|01 consuming|_|03 new|_|12 information|_|05 or experiences|_|02 . the process|_|06 of dying|_|01 inflicts|_|01 bad|_|03 emotions|_|01 on me , but thinking|_|03 about being dead|_|01 does not inflict|_|01 many|_|01 emotions|_|01 on me . i feel|_|05 neutral|_|07 or calm|_|01 about the idea|_|01 , and i see|_|01 no rational|_|01 reason|_|01 for worrying|_|06 about it .
this article|_|04 is quite|_|04 disturbing|_|02 in the way|_|06 that americans|_|03 act|_|02 towards one|_|06 another|_|01 . the display|_|04 of the confederate|_|01 flag|_|01 means|_|04 different|_|01 things|_|05 for different|_|01 americans|_|03 all over the country|_|04 and it kind|_|01 of makes|_|08 me sad|_|02 with the way|_|06 people|_|01 treat|_|08 one|_|06 another|_|01 . being an american|_|01 means|_|04 uniting|_|01 as one|_|06 , not fighting|_|03 over a flag|_|01 or the real|_|03 issue|_|01 , legal|_|05 citizens|_|01 who may|_|01 not be white|_|12 .
it 's always|_|02 sad|_|01 to hear|_|02 someone|_|01 losing|_|07 their lives|_|08 , especially|_|01 during a terrible|_|01 crash|_|03 such as yi|_|01 x|_|02 , who was the first|_|01 woman|_|02 to fly|_|12 a chinese|_|01 fighter|_|01 jet|_|07 . it 's even|_|03 worse|_|01 that it happened|_|01 during a training|_|05 mission|_|04 , and not a real|_|02 mission|_|04 . i hope|_|03 her family|_|01 can find|_|04 peace|_|05 and that she can be remembered|_|07 for her positivist|_|01 and caring|_|01 towards others .
i just read|_|03 an article|_|04 about wild|_|03 fires|_|09 sending|_|02 a smokey haze|_|01 across|_|02 the state|_|02 near|_|03 the appalachian|_|01 mountains|_|02 . can you imagine|_|02 how big|_|01 the fire|_|09 must|_|01 be to spread|_|07 so far|_|05 and wide|_|06 ? and the people|_|01 in the area|_|01 obviously|_|01 suffer|_|11 the most . what if you have asthma|_|01 or some other condition|_|05 that restricts|_|03 your breathing|_|01 ?
hey look|_|02 at what i have been reading|_|06 into . i want|_|03 your opinions|_|04 on this matter|_|04 at hand|_|06 . so civilian|_|01 casualties|_|01 are starting|_|03 to rise|_|08 as iraqi|_|01 forces|_|04 push|_|02 into mosul|_|01 . the vehicles|_|03 screeched|_|03 into the small|_|02 field|_|01 hospital|_|02 on the outskirts|_|01 of mosul|_|01 carrying|_|02 desperate|_|04 loads|_|01 : soldiers|_|01 injured|_|01 in battle|_|01 as well|_|03 as men|_|01 , women|_|02 and children|_|03 caught|_|28 in the crossfire|_|01 of iraq|_|01 ’s war|_|02 against the islamic|_|01 state|_|02 . now you know|_|10 me . i would be in terrible|_|02 trouble|_|02 this is not a way|_|01 of life|_|13 . why are were even|_|03 in war|_|02 . why harm|_|01 our children|_|03 . this has saddened|_|02 me to no end|_|01 . we do not need|_|02 , want|_|03 or find|_|02 any peace|_|01 in war|_|02 !
hey bro you been hearing|_|02 about that shooting|_|01 in charlotte|_|02 , n.c ? is n't that pretty|_|01 messed|_|02 up that all these police|_|01 shootings|_|02 and racial|_|02 black|_|12 lives|_|11 matter|_|02 approach|_|05 to life|_|11 and living|_|06 day|_|01 to day|_|01 ? i ready|_|12 that 16|_|01 cops|_|05 were injured|_|01 due|_|02 to a protest|_|03 / standoff|_|03 . i guess|_|02 they say|_|09 the cop|_|05 shot|_|01 the black|_|12 man|_|08 and he was even|_|01 unarmed|_|02 . why so thee have to shot|_|01 someone|_|01 when they do n't even|_|01 have a chance|_|01 to defend|_|02 themselves . it is very sad|_|02 world|_|08 we all live|_|02 in these days|_|01 . no one|_|02 can get|_|02 along|_|03 but shooting|_|01 and fighting|_|02 you best|_|03 believe|_|05 they can do all that .
okay|_|01 , i live|_|01 by the arkansas|_|02 river|_|01 so i know|_|03 about snapping|_|10 turtles|_|01 . all this guy|_|03 had to do is move|_|01 to another|_|01 spot|_|08 and the turtle|_|01 was not going|_|01 to chase|_|01 him down . i 'm sure|_|08 the guy|_|03 must|_|01 have been near|_|01 a nest|_|05 or something if the turtle|_|01 tried|_|01 to attack|_|03 . still|_|04 , should he be charged|_|01 with a felony|_|01 ? my granny|_|01 jones|_|02 used|_|01 to make|_|02 turtle|_|01 soup|_|01 out of the snappers|_|04 they fished|_|02 out of her creek|_|01 . i guess|_|02 the difference|_|01 is he was n't killing|_|02 the turtle|_|01 for food|_|02 ... but , a felony|_|01 ?
sure|_|07 glad|_|01 i live|_|02 in minnesota|_|01 and not chicago|_|03 . i hear|_|02 the latest|_|01 problem|_|01 is lead|_|23 in the water|_|02 . now they are shutting|_|01 down all the outdoor|_|02 fountains|_|03 . one|_|01 reason|_|02 is to protect|_|02 the homeless|_|02 . lo who are they kidding|_|02 . like|_|02 anyone actually|_|02 cares|_|02 about the homeless|_|02 . we have this pompous|_|02 rich|_|11 guy|_|03 donald trump|_|02 cutting|_|26 peoples|_|01 snap|_|01 on 2019 while at the same time|_|02 cities|_|03 are worrying|_|02 about lead|_|05 in the water|_|02 to protect|_|02 the homeless|_|02 . it 's all really|_|01 annoying|_|01 . granted|_|02 i agree|_|02 lead|_|05 is bad|_|01 but then again some govt . clown|_|02 probably|_|01 needs|_|02 to do something to justify|_|02 the 6|_|01 figure|_|01 income|_|01 they make|_|18 .
i was with him and mildly|_|01 supportive|_|01 of him until i found|_|05 out about the second|_|01 shooting|_|02 . you ca|_|01 n't just go|_|03 shooting|_|03 everybody who had every|_|02 treated|_|01 your daughter|_|01 wrong|_|01 . my initial|_|01 thought|_|01 was , oh|_|01 the justice|_|02 system|_|05 failed|_|09 and this guy|_|03 had it coming|_|04 . then after reading|_|06 about the second|_|01 incident|_|02 , i 'm starting|_|09 to feel|_|05 like|_|02 this was more a crazy|_|03 guy|_|03 on a shooting|_|03 spree|_|01 .
i feel|_|05 bad|_|01 for the queen|_|02 . she just lost|_|08 her husband|_|01 and now she 's sick|_|06 . i also|_|02 feel|_|05 bad|_|01 for the people|_|01 over there . they 've had rulers|_|01 as leaders|_|01 for so long|_|01 that most of the were n't even|_|03 alive|_|01 to experience|_|03 anybody else|_|03 . i hope|_|03 she recovers|_|04 and is able|_|01 to get|_|02 a few more good|_|13 years|_|03 out of her life|_|01 .
i think|_|02 most people|_|03 would be disturbed|_|02 about how animals|_|01 are treated|_|01 before they are slaughtered|_|01 and used|_|01 for meat|_|01 . i feel|_|05 like|_|02 aside|_|06 from clearly|_|01 inhumane|_|01 treatment|_|03 , it should be expected|_|04 that killing|_|01 an animal|_|01 for food|_|02 is n't exactly|_|01 going|_|01 to be the most pleasant|_|02 process|_|03 for the creature|_|03 . i 'm not particularly|_|01 surprised|_|02 that the method|_|01 of stunning|_|03 chickens|_|01 has a failure|_|02 rate|_|02 .
here 's another|_|01 article|_|04 from the 2016 campaign|_|01 that did n't age|_|01 well|_|01 . read|_|06 it and have a laugh|_|01 . it 's pretty|_|01 ridiculous|_|02 in retrospect|_|01 . more of the women|_|02 they 're talking|_|05 about voted|_|05 for trump|_|02 than hillary|_|01 . i guess|_|02 they never|_|02 asked|_|04 women|_|02 if those allegations|_|02 bothered|_|01 them or were important|_|01 . i know|_|10 that you told|_|02 me after the access|_|02 hollywood|_|03 tapes|_|04 that you did n't care|_|02 about that stuff|_|04 , that policy|_|03 issues|_|01 were more important|_|01 .
i still|_|04 do n't like|_|02 kim jon - un|_|01 , but he may|_|01 be starting|_|06 to realize|_|02 that being cooperative|_|02 and living|_|01 peacefully|_|01 is a better|_|20 way|_|01 of living|_|02 and leading|_|03 , rather|_|02 than the aggressive|_|03 , threatening|_|02 leader|_|01 he is trying|_|01 to show|_|01 us|_|01 in the past|_|01 . we may|_|01 never|_|01 know|_|01 his|_|01 real|_|04 motives|_|02 , but as long|_|01 as north|_|02 korea|_|01 cooperates|_|01 and be a productive|_|03 nation|_|02 , then a lot|_|04 of other countries|_|02 will help|_|05 them in times|_|06 of need|_|02 .
we have to become|_|02 aware|_|01 of climate|_|02 change|_|09 . this problem|_|01 belongs|_|03 to everyone and if we ignore|_|04 this problem|_|01 , it will become|_|02 irreversible|_|01 . we will not have anything to inherit|_|02 from our children|_|03 . let|_|01 us|_|01 support|_|02 campaigns|_|02 for the conservation|_|02 of the environment|_|02 and the use|_|02 of renewable|_|02 energy|_|06 . the politicians|_|03 only watch|_|06 over the interests|_|05 of the companies|_|01 and not of the individuals|_|01 .
climate|_|02 change|_|01 is already|_|01 evident|_|03 in all the ecosystems|_|01 of the earth|_|01 . the genes|_|01 of living|_|06 beings are changing|_|01 in response|_|03 to climate|_|02 changes|_|01 , affecting|_|02 ecosystems|_|01 around|_|01 the world|_|08 . the changes|_|01 that by natural|_|04 means|_|01 should take|_|24 a hundred|_|01 of decades|_|01 to occur|_|01 , takes|_|24 very few years|_|03 to complete|_|02 . this disorder|_|01 affects|_|02 the whole|_|01 relationship|_|03 of the ecosystems|_|01 , discouraging|_|02 them and causing|_|01 their extinction|_|04 .
what horror|_|01 this news|_|01 . in poor|_|02 little|_|08 boy|_|01 of just 2|_|01 years|_|01 of age|_|01 he fell|_|08 through the window|_|05 of his|_|01 apartment|_|01 on the 11ht floor|_|02 of a building|_|01 . the mother|_|05 relates|_|02 that i go|_|01 to sleep|_|02 with her older|_|01 brother|_|01 and this one|_|01 hour|_|04 later|_|01 i climb|_|02 to the window|_|05 that apparently|_|01 was open|_|02 and rushed|_|01 into the void|_|02 crashing|_|04 with the asphalt|_|02 of the parking|_|02 lot|_|05 . a neighbor|_|02 found|_|01 the scene|_|02 and desperate|_|01 for horror|_|01 called|_|02 911 .
this area|_|06 has been devastated|_|01 by natural|_|05 disasters|_|03 and it appears|_|02 to only be getting|_|14 worse|_|09 . i ca|_|01 n't believe|_|01 the amount|_|02 of disasters|_|03 that appear|_|02 to be concentrated|_|05 in one|_|05 place|_|07 , and the resilience|_|02 that the citizens|_|01 have shown|_|08 to survive|_|02 . i also|_|02 ca|_|01 n't believe|_|01 the looting|_|01 and break|_|02 - ins that have been reported|_|04 in the area|_|06 , what kind|_|01 of people|_|01 steal|_|03 from those in need|_|02 ?
i ca|_|01 n't believe|_|01 that these vultures|_|01 would take|_|06 advantage|_|01 of individuals|_|01 in predicaments|_|01 where they were desperate|_|04 and had to take|_|06 out a high|_|01 volume|_|06 of loans|_|01 in order|_|11 to earn|_|08 a better|_|17 living|_|06 , in their mind|_|06 . i understand|_|02 the concept|_|01 , but the actual|_|02 intent|_|01 of the administrators|_|03 of tit|_|01 tech|_|01 and other for - profit|_|02 schools|_|05 is devastating|_|01 with regards|_|01 to actually|_|04 helping|_|01 student|_|01 's
there are no words|_|01 for how much|_|01 i ignore|_|04 trump|_|02 and his|_|01 antics|_|01 . it has made|_|36 me numb|_|06 and lose|_|01 hope|_|02 in the whole|_|01 system|_|08 . i no longer|_|01 feel|_|05 anything loyalty|_|02 for america|_|01 or its system|_|08 . i think|_|03 it is all a sham|_|01 and no one|_|01 should have to feel|_|05 like|_|04 that about their own country|_|02 where they pay|_|10 taxes|_|01 to live|_|01 and work|_|36 and breathe|_|02 .
this is such a weird|_|02 experience|_|03 and so unexplained|_|02 . why are so many|_|01 people|_|01 dying|_|05 in the med|_|01 ? there are not enough|_|01 safety|_|02 measures|_|01 being put|_|01 in place|_|01 so that people|_|01 can safely|_|01 enjoy|_|04 themselves . it is so easy|_|12 to take|_|34 someone|_|01 's money|_|03 but then you do not give|_|03 them the safety|_|02 that they paid|_|01 for . it 's sad|_|01 and such a shame|_|02 but honestly|_|01 , i not at all surprised|_|01 .

i really like kate and she is an amazing actress . it sucks that she and her husband after so many years have decided to call it quits . america has one of the highest divorce rates in the world , which makes me feel that EMOJOYPOSITIVE is harder to attain today . although i am a EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST and i feel that not every coupling has to be condemned to such a EMOANTICIPATIONNEGATIVE as kate , len and most americans have to EMOPOSITIVE .
was this really noe - nazi duckboards ? or was this a left - wing EMOANTICIPATION to EMOANGERANTICIPATIONFEARNEGATIVE minorities and drive them to the polls ? why are we not past this EMODISGUSTNEGATIVE ? EMOANGERDISGUSTNEGATIVE . i EMOJOYPOSITIVE a lot of things about being southern , but this EMODISGUSTNEGATIVE drives me nuts . who does this ? can we bring back the stockade ? tar and feather ?
thank goodness for presentiment hopefully this means an end to dacha and hopefully immigration EMOPOSITIVE in the near future ! these people have EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS the EMOTRUST and are here illegally yet they EMOANTICIPATIONPOSITIVESURPRISETRUST to be treated just like us citizens . dacha is a EMOANGERNEGATIVESURPRISE in the face to those immigrants who followed the EMOTRUST and went through the process to become EMOPOSITIVETRUST citizens . liberals are not adjusting very well to the EMONEGATIVE of hillary - they are still EMONEGATIVESADNESS .
EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVE control should be a priority in our country . after EMOPOSITIVE about children who EMONEGATIVESADNESS their lives due to EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVE EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS , it 's hard to EMOANGERNEGATIVE that it 's way to easy to get your hands on a EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVE . americans are much like people all over the world , but we have infinitely more EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVE deaths , and it 's all because of the EMOPOSITIVE of EMOANTICIPATIONPOSITIVE those guns .
women in iceland protested the EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST EMONEGATIVE between men and women by arguing that a woman 's EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST is 30 % less than the EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST of a man in similar work positions , the women of iceland decreased their EMOPOSITIVE day 30 % of the EMOANTICIPATION EMOANTICIPATION work and went out to protest EMOPOSITIVETRUST to a square . this was EMOPOSITIVE by the EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST of the EMOPOSITIVE .
this is an old article , that made the paris accords seem so EMOPOSITIVETRUST and EMOANTICIPATIONPOSITIVETRUST , until EMOSURPRISE revealed that it was a EMODISGUSTNEGATIVE deal that took EMOPOSITIVE of the us , obligating them to EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST way more than other countries . plus the soonest results of this regulation will not occur for a century , and will be just a blip of difference . it 's a scam .
lao why has no one told me about this . this i\should be like EMOANTICIPATIONPOSITIVE EMOPOSITIVE from insurance companies but of course they are trying the most amount of money off of their customers . us EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST drivers are the EMOPOSITIVE why they are profitable in the first place , so they could do their part and give us discounts for our EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST driving practices
i do n't understand why there is so much hate . it 's like every one lives in their own little bubble seeing everything EMONEGATIVE to them as a EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVE . they take up EMOANGERDISGUSTNEGATIVE ideology because they do n't like something , instead of just disassociating with it . this greatly saddens me , for i have seen the world in all it 's wonder . where the EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST of people just want to live in EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST , without boundaries . yet this idea of cultural EMOTRUST has become EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS further dividing people . if only more people could set aside their EMONEGATIVE ideals , and just accept each other as other humans . instead we EMOPOSITIVE and further separate ourselves due to every difference . i would EMOPOSITIVETRUST to just EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS , than put up with such cruel EMOANGERDISGUSTFEARNEGATIVE people . i am disgusted with my country of americans . we deserve to burn ....
hey b , remember that conversation we had the other day , well i EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST an article that talks about it . it basically says that humans have EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS 10 percent of earth 's EMOANTICIPATIONFEARSADNESS in the last 25 years . the article said that the total EMOPOSITIVE area is about half the size of the amazon and twice the size of the whole state of alaska . that is about 1.3 million square miles of EMOANTICIPATIONFEARSADNESS , that just disappeared . the article also revealed that EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST has one to two decades more to turn it around before it is too EMONEGATIVESADNESS . i hope something is done soon and i 'll send you a link to the article .
hi . just read an article about how russia is moving some of their EMOFEAR ships near to britain . what 's the deal there ? i can really figure out what the russian EMOFEARNEGATIVE is up to . the article says they are stating the want to keep EMOPOSITIVE waterways EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST , but i did n't know there was a EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS . maybe they 're creating one .
venezuela and many of it 's sister countries are going through a EMONEGATIVE . due to drops in oil prices , and the EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS of income the country has EMOPOSITIVE from this drop , the citizens are the ones that are paying for it . they are EMOANTICIPATIONNEGATIVE , there is issues with people not having enough EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST and EMONEGATIVE . their political powers are EMONEGATIVE and ca n't be counted on for help . there is EMOANGERNEGATIVE , rebels and rampant EMOANGERNEGATIVE . my heart breaks for this people , as they do n't have anyone to turn to for help . they feel powerless , EMOANTICIPATIONNEGATIVE and scared .
EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVESURPRISE is a EMOPOSITIVETRUST EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS . many people are dead , and more people are severely EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS . the drilling is likely what caused it , and the developer should be held EMOPOSITIVETRUST . he has caused much EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS and EMODISGUSTFEARNEGATIVESADNESS . kenyans deserve better , and since he did n't listen to ca warnings , he should EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST for what he did . the other buildings in the area should be thoroughly tested to see if anything can be done to EMOFEAR this .
i think it is our responsibility as a first world country to be EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST EMOPOSITIVE to these area in brazil and columbia . erika EMONEGATIVE could EMOPOSITIVE to be an epidemic and that is a global issue , not just a country . EMOPOSITIVE them access to EMOPOSITIVE EMOANTICIPATIONFEARPOSITIVETRUST training to spread better health practices and health education to the EMOPOSITIVE could be the most EMOPOSITIVETRUST thing to preventing more spread of the EMONEGATIVE
i feel like the EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS among st other EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS that occurred in this article is EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST sad . like other articles that i have read , it seems like there is just so much death occurring and there is not too much coverage over it . the amount that we do see do n't seem to even scratch the surface as there are many other acts of EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS and events that occur that take the lives of many other people from places like third world countries that do n't even get broadcaster at all . sad to see that our world is slowly spiraling into this EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS that just continues to EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST .
the spread of EMODISGUSTFEARNEGATIVESADNESS is very EMOPOSITIVE in haiti . it is costing tons of lives , and money EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST and doctors are very much needed . its hard to control like any other high spreading disease . doctors need EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST so much that they ca nt keep up with ever growing number of patients . they need EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST , EMOANTICIPATIONFEARPOSITIVETRUST EMOPOSITIVE , and other miscellaneous equipment that would help them EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST their EMOPOSITIVE and combating the outbreak .
i feel like this is a very EMOANGERNEGATIVE article . in not sure who wrote this article but i truly feel like they have a lot of raw mixed up emotional feelings that they ca nt get out . although , we are all very aware of the EMOPOSITIVETRUST changes going on int he world with EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST and everyone going through the issues of being EMOANGERNEGATIVE and such .. its a lot to handle and a lot of people just font know what to do . i feel lad for the people in the story
" i would give these people a life sentence in EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS . people who EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS from the less EMOPOSITIVE and exploit EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST and innocents have no place in our society ! they stole from pensioners and investors and blew millions on luxuries and other forms of EMOJOYPOSITIVE experiences at the expense of people , causing EMODISGUSTFEARNEGATIVESADNESS and EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS ! they should be punished accordingly , a EMOSADNESS cell with a EMODISGUSTNEGATIVE and a meal of EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS mush twice a day would EMONEGATIVETRUST them just right . it 's a typical story about wealthy and EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST out there , who always EMOFEARNEGATIVE the innocents and somehow able to get away and EMOTRUST " " EMOPOSITIVETRUST " " . i would especially EMOTRUST no EMOPOSITIVE when it comes to these EMODISGUSTNEGATIVE bankers all over the world . there is absolutely no EMONEGATIVE for their crimes - so much poverty and EMONEGATIVESADNESS all over the world ! "
it 's a EMODISGUSTFEARNEGATIVESADNESS that air EMODISGUSTNEGATIVE has potentially been linked to increased mental EMOANGERDISGUSTNEGATIVESADNESS with EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVESURPRISE children . we often do n't take into EMOTRUST all the EMOANGERDISGUSTNEGATIVESADNESS that the fossil fuel companies have done to our society . we only EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST them for creating the fuels we use but never EMONEGATIVESADNESS them appropriately for all the EMOANGERDISGUSTNEGATIVESADNESS that they cause us .
so apparently russia sent a bunch of bombs on a EMOTRUST in syria . it killed like 22 kids . now the russian EMOFEARNEGATIVE is trying to say it never happened . they even showed satellite images of another place and claimed it was there . some organization called hew ( human rights EMOANTICIPATIONFEAR ) had evidence to EMOTRUST otherwise . they even had images of the same type of aircraft that the russians use .
this is totally unsurprising for the use . the laws are usually EMOPOSITIVE in these extreme cases though , which makes this occurrence a strange one . there is some EMONEGATIVE political EMOPOSITIVE at work here . this woman 's EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS is being used to advance some goal most likely . i wonder what they 're up to . what do you think ?
it saddens and scares me that people do n't see terrorists for what they are : radicalized individuals who have gone EMODISGUSTNEGATIVE . the vast EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST of muslims are peaceful people who just want to live their lives and EMOPOSITIVE their EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST . this country needs to be EMOPOSITIVE on other cultures so we stop EMOFEARNEGATIVE the EMOANTICIPATIONFEARNEGATIVE . EMOPOSITIVE more walls and dividers between different groups of people wo n't help anything .
EMOPOSITIVE EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST , how are you ? i heard that you EMONEGATIVESADNESS down the stairs and EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS your leg ! ! are you ok ? hope you are getting better . but seriously , what really happened ? your EMOFEARNEGATIVE told me that you were running and EMONEGATIVESADNESS but i want to hear directly from you . i am EMOANTICIPATION to the hospital to EMOPOSITIVE you in an hour . that 's my final decision . no one can EMOFEAR it , and yes because you did n't come to EMOTRUST today you missed a lot of work . do n't be too EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST , you 'll have to complete the work later
this does not surprise me . the people on horny are EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST of EMODISGUSTNEGATIVE . so , it is not hard to believe they were married to a person who would do something like this . it does not really sound like a big deal either . he could have done much EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS . did she even lose money because of this ? i would EMOSURPRISE not .
it is disturbing to me that people in the us are not starting as many EMONEGATIVE businesses and the number of entrepreneurs is EMONEGATIVESADNESS . i think it 's because of all the EMOFEARNEGATIVE regulations and red tape that makes it EMOFEAR for a EMONEGATIVE business to EMOANTICIPATION up and compete . it 's also of concern that us workers are stressed about EMOPOSITIVE security .
i feel very sad for the family of people who have EMONEGATIVESADNESS their loved ones , especially family members that were so very deeply involved with the EMOPOSITIVE and have EMONEGATIVE so many hearts of the people around them as well . i am sure that for a EMOANTICIPATION EMOANTICIPATION , memories and EMOJOYPOSITIVE moments will be told with heart felt warmth for many generations .
hello there . so i just read this disturbing story about a EMOPOSITIVETRUST who is involved in EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVE EMODISGUSTNEGATIVE . he is now going to face courts for such a EMOANGERDISGUSTFEARNEGATIVE habit . i think this EMOPOSITIVETRUST should really be punished EMOPOSITIVE so that even those who were thinking of doing it can take notice . this is totally EMONEGATIVESADNESS in our education EMOTRUST
other story similar to the local news about the EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS of a woman i know in town . it always makes me think of the children first . it also makes me wonder how a person could commit such atrocities , especially in front of children . the EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVE that called 911 will no EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESSTRUST mentally live with that phone call for the EMOPOSITIVE of their life . article seem to have been murder , and a middle class home , maybe drug use or robbery gone EMONEGATIVE ? what is EMONEGATIVE with the world today ? i will certainly EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST my children tighter tonight after EMOPOSITIVE all these articles about murder , grieving children , deaths , worldly disasters and EMONEGATIVESADNESSTRUST . the world is such an EMOPOSITIVE , EMOJOYPOSITIVESURPRISETRUST yet sad place all at once . i will also say a prayer for those kids and pray and be EMOJOYPOSITIVE for mine .
take a look at this . it 's very dry , and i do n't understand half the EMOANGERNEGATIVE , but while i was EMOPOSITIVE it , i was feeling sort of EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVE that apparently plant and animal species are adapting to the warming climate . it seemed like the planet is warming slowly enough for a lot of ecosystems to EMOPOSITIVE . and then i read the last bit , about humans and EMOPOSITIVE , and got EMONEGATIVE all over again . will we EMOPOSITIVE , too ? i got ta say , at this point , i 'm hoping that EMOFEARNEGATIVESURPRISE in hawaii spews a gazillion tons of EMONEGATIVE ( after everyone 's been evacuated , of course ) into the atmosphere to block the sun and EMOPOSITIVE things down . it may be our best shot . we could only be so EMOJOYPOSITIVESURPRISE .
if we think we have it bad having to put up with EMOSURPRISE , think about how mexico feels . this article puts a lot in perspective , but i really EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS with the quote by the mexican EMONEGATIVE minister saying that americans chose racism and hate . do n't group us all in one category . we did n't all choose this EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVESURPRISE to be EMOPOSITIVETRUST . i understand their fears and EMONEGATIVE , but that comment really just rubbed me the EMONEGATIVE way . hopefully both countries can maintain their ties until he 's out of office .
it deeply saddens me to think that a mother could EMONEGATIVESADNESSSURPRISE her EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVE on a porch and EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS it . i feel some EMOANGERNEGATIVE towards the mother for abandoning her EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVESURPRISE , EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVE . the EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVE is very EMOJOYPOSITIVESURPRISE to have been EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST by EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST strangers who were able to deliver it to safety . i hope that the EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVE will be adopted into a EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST family and will be given a EMOPOSITIVE upbringing .
the EMOSURPRISE had made a huge impact on a american EMOANGER . he had made some terrible move on the EMOANGER and it had made the other countries to turn on america.after a EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST supremacist carried out a massacre of EMONEGATIVESADNESS churchgoers in charleston , s.c. , it seemed as though the EMOPOSITIVETRUST EMOANGERNEGATIVE flag . these were also made some huge impact on the american EMOANGER that had made by EMOSURPRISE . but now that explosive and EMONEGATIVE vestige of the old south is back , in a new — and , to some americans , newly disturbing context . during EMOPOSITIVETRUST - EMOPOSITIVETRUST donald j. EMOSURPRISE ’s campaign . when he was still running for EMOPOSITIVETRUST in june 2015 , EMOSURPRISE was asked whether or not the EMOPOSITIVETRUST flag EMOFEARPOSITIVE above the south carolina state house needed to be taken down . “ i think it probably does .
this article brings back to mind the overall mass EMOFEARNEGATIVE that the left , centrists , and scone feel when they think about EMOSURPRISE . i 'm not a EMOSURPRISE EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST , but i honestly believe people are truly EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVE at this point . it has become EMODISGUST inducing . liberals should be more pissed at the dc for crapping on bernie . scone should just admit to being big EMOFEARNEGATIVE centrists so we can all move on .
did you hear about that bus EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESSSURPRISE that happened in delaware . it was very sad , also i read that 2 people were EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS . i hope these people can recover EMOPOSITIVETRUST from their injuries and go on to EMOPOSITIVE fulfilling lives . hopefully something like this will never ever EMOANTICIPATION again and measures are taken to EMOFEAR it .
just EMONEGATIVESADNESS to let you know about a news story i came across . it is about an elephant , named noyes . he is been owned by a guy and held in chains . he used noyes to perform for EMOANTICIPATIONPOSITIVE entertainment in circuses and EMOFEARNEGATIVE for most of her life to give rides to adults and children across the EMOPOSITIVETRUST states . oh , and she has been in solitary for almost 30 years , that is a lifetime . being EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS for such a EMOANTICIPATION period caused EMOPOSITIVE EMONEGATIVE to her health as well as to her psychological well being . the owner has been cited numerous times but in the same EMOANTICIPATION his license was still approved for EMOPOSITIVE each year . there should be awareness for this abuse to stop .
ugh ! i am literally EMODISGUSTNEGATIVESADNESS to my EMODISGUST about all of these attacks . it 's utter EMONEGATIVE about how many people have been killed and for what ? ! EMONEGATIVE preferences on what a someone believes a society should consist of ? ! it is EMOANGERDISGUSTFEARNEGATIVE . my heart really goes out to all those families and the doctors ! those doctors are tirelessly EMOPOSITIVE to EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST as many people they can and even by a dim light since the conditions around them are being EMONEGATIVE to shreds . the amount of EMOPOSITIVE to try so hard and keep the number of people dying as low as possible is amazing , to say the least . i really feel sad for the families that have EMONEGATIVESADNESS so many loved ones and that have been EMOANGERFEARSADNESS .
this man lived here almost his entire life . his infractions in which he was charged with are explainable . he literally was getting back his only EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST property from a more than troubled house . this also was a very EMOANTICIPATION EMOANTICIPATION ago . he has since built himself up a life with a family and now they are looking to EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS him . this is a EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS . we must do something about this !
hey , i think that you should check out this article . i feel bad for the citizens down in mexico city and south america . they are going through some troubled times and america is barely doing anything to help out with their situation . those children do not deserve the life they are going through at the moment and i believe that we should do something to make them feel like they are EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST to be apart of their country .
wow , did you hear what happened to millikan sheratan in france ? she was gassed and beaten and robbed . that is EMONEGATIVE ! so scary and it could EMOANTICIPATION to anyone everywhere . she is EMOJOYPOSITIVESURPRISE to be EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST . it is sad though that this story got mixed in with EMOANGER because it was n't even about clinton , or obama or EMOSURPRISE .
this is really a moving story and i could see it being motivating for a lot of women . they can realize that anyone can be at EMOANTICIPATIONFEARNEGATIVE for cancer . it does n't matter whether you are a favor actress or an ordinary person . it can be devastating to families and often affects them in many different ways . such stories should be more EMOPOSITIVE to give people hope .
hey guys as you can see here an elderly woman has come up and was taken tot he hospital by the EMOFEARPOSITIVETRUST and they are requesting EMOPOSITIVE trying to identify her and see who knows her if any of you have seen this woman or know any of her relatives or her name that would really EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST in helping the EMOFEARPOSITIVETRUST get her back with her family and reunite with them if you have any tips o EMONEGATIVE sort pleas one EMOPOSITIVE and call the EMOFEARPOSITIVETRUST
EMOSURPRISE brampton should EMONEGATIVETRUST as an example to others . EMOPOSITIVE about being EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS . she demonstrated clear signs of needing help , and the EMOTRUST failed her . what a terrible EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS ! a EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST , EMOPOSITIVETRUST , conflicted woman who was EMONEGATIVESADNESS way too soon . it is sad to see someone EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS with EMONEGATIVESADNESS and other mental illnesses . society needs to do better to help people in need , especially when they are asking for it . it is a EMODISGUSTFEARNEGATIVESADNESS what happened to her .
i felt that EMOPOSITIVE the excerpt from the article was sad and had me feeling EMONEGATIVESADNESS to an extent . i know it 's just an article but EMOFEARNEGATIVE about all the bad in the world is just an EMOPOSITIVETRUST way to get a poor EMOANTICIPATION to the day . i was mostly wondering what the situation was where richard hon was killed in the los angeles home . hos home was it and why was george stroumbolopoulos there . i 'd like to know the more intricate details of what went down in this EMOANGERNEGATIVE . was it a murder of EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST or was it EMONEGATIVE blooded . was it in the moment or was it calculated . what will EMOANTICIPATION now , hopefully and EMOANTICIPATION can EMOSURPRISE this .
i personally do n't EMOPOSITIVE with science making these kinds of decisions . maybe , just maybe , a higher power did n't want these people to reproduce ? how do we know that these methods do n't permanently EMOFEAR something in the dna that helps EMOPOSITIVETRUST that a EMOANTICIPATION killer is born four of five generations down the line . how do we know ? there have been no studies . i would EMOSURPRISE by this article that since boys that are born using this method also have low sperm counts , that something , or someone , somewhere , is trying to tell them something .
middle east is fucked up , i 've honestly never heard of a middle east country such as afghanistan deporting people , the mention of it just sound funny , who the heck would want to stay in that EMOANGERDISGUSTNEGATIVE hole country that has been infested with terrorists and EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVE rapists ? perhaps those refugees are out of EMOPOSITIVE , honestly they should come to a better country such as u.s. or u.k , even though those 2 countries have their own policies regarding immigration , but i think they 're quite EMOANGERNEGATIVESADNESS to people from EMOFEARNEGATIVE EMONEGATIVE countries
new wildfires across appalachia ! EMOANTICIPATION i 'd EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST this with you after our EMOPOSITIVE about california EMONEGATIVESURPRISE fires . this one is huge in the appalachian mountains and seems to be spreading . it can also be seen from space ! hopefully everyone gets out EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST and the firefighters are all able to contain it safely . thinking of you !
inst it EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS man that more and more sports legends are starting to pass away ? him and jack were perhaps the most EMOPOSITIVETRUST icons in golf . have you ever had an arnold palmer ? it 's a really good drink too . we should EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST a few arnold palmer later on today to EMOPOSITIVETRUST the life of this great man . should we EMOANGERNEGATIVE a few rounds today as well ? i mean i know you 're a big EMOPOSITIVE fan , so i understand how this is upsetting you . i will send you more articles about him later on today so we can EMOPOSITIVE more about him . what do you think ? who do you think was better ? jack or arnold ? what about tiger ? either way , i hope you get this article and it helps lift your EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVESURPRISE a bit . i can not really connect to the article since i am not a big golf person , but i still think we should EMOPOSITIVETRUST the man .
i just read about a EMONEGATIVE 10 story EMOPOSITIVE EMODISGUSTFEARNEGATIVESADNESS in a town called EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVESURPRISE . i 'm EMOFEARNEGATIVE about this news because they 're still searching for survivors . there 's been a report that 9 are still EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS . i hope they 're able to find these EMONEGATIVESADNESS victims . it was EMODISGUSTFEARNEGATIVESADNESS EMOPOSITIVE about the EMOTRUST because people could be heard EMOANGERDISGUSTFEARNEGATIVE and shouting for help . i 'm hopeful that they can help find any remaining survivors . this is such an EMONEGATIVESADNESS event . the cause was due to bad EMOPOSITIVE construction as the developers have EMOFEARNEGATIVE gone into EMOFEAR . experts said a recent drilling underneath the EMOPOSITIVE triggered the EMODISGUSTFEARNEGATIVESADNESS . this is EMOANGERDISGUSTFEARNEGATIVE to hear . could you imagine if this happened to the office EMOPOSITIVE we worked out ? such awful and careless EMOANTICIPATIONPOSITIVETRUST resulting in EMONEGATIVESADNESS lives .
so , i just read this article about a EMOTRUST of bombing in new york and new jersey and how these acts are being viewed as an act of terrorism . sometimes i still can not believe that we lived through 9/11 , especially because before that i had never even heard the EMOPOSITIVETRUST terrorism or knew what a terrorist EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVE was . and now , we live in a world where we are EMOTRUST EMOFEARNEGATIVE about possible EMOFEARNEGATIVE attacks or terrorists regularly on the news . it just makes me absolutely EMODISGUSTNEGATIVESADNESS that this is the world i am raising my kids in and that we have to live in EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVE of someone trying to EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS us or setting up bombs to surprise EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVE people . the EMOTRUST that we can not live a carefree life anymore because of the EMODISGUSTNEGATIVESADNESS minds of individuals scares me EMOANTICIPATION and makes me wish i could keep my kids in a bubble ! ! !
this is a sad article . some many things are EMOANTICIPATIONFEARNEGATIVE for those born outside the country . it is always EMOANGERDISGUSTNEGATIVESADNESS that others are able to get deported after spending most of their lives in the usa , especially those that came at a very early age . also us parents that adopt children should be EMOPOSITIVE us citizenship .
i just read this article about how canada actually had EMOTRUST where they would EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVE indigenous people of their EMOPOSITIVE to go . they tried to EMOFEARNEGATIVE their history , and their language . i always EMOANTICIPATION canada was such a peaceful country . these people were even experimented on , and the EMOTRUST was still in EMOFEARTRUST up until 1996 ! , that is astonishing . i EMOANTICIPATION , we , americans , were the only ones who EMOFEARNEGATIVE the indigenous people away , or tried to EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS their EMOPOSITIVE . this just shows you that people are EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST much the same , and EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST much were savages , until recently . even now though , we still have a EMOANTICIPATION way to go , until we reach a place where everyone EMOPOSITIVE and differences are EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVE , and not shamed , and EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS
it seems like the EMOPOSITIVE of this EMOANGERNEGATIVE is so EMOANGERANTICIPATIONFEARNEGATIVE . just because russia and poland may have had tensions for a while , it does not justify that they assassinated the guy . i mean , if everyone just assume their EMOANGERDISGUSTFEARNEGATIVE is the EMOANTICIPATION of their EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS , they will just be creating false EMOANGER with no EMOPOSITIVETRUST purpose . i understand that he is EMOANGERNEGATIVESADNESS for their EMONEGATIVESADNESS , and that this was avoidable from bad weather and EMOPOSITIVETRUST control , but still .
who knew that a EMOFEARNEGATIVE hitting two countries would be less disturbing that articles about trees and EMONEGATIVE . our EMOFEARPOSITIVE is ruled by EMOPOSITIVE and when two people EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS a EMOANGERNEGATIVE we EMONEGATIVE . but EMOTRUST us dead trees for tell us we are breathing residue for a EMODISGUSTNEGATIVE cleaner and we freeze with EMOFEARNEGATIVE . perspective is a hard thing to find sometimes .
i have always EMOANTICIPATION that EMOANGER were a scam and this is another example of EMOANGER gone EMONEGATIVE . every country runs into problems sometimes and in this EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS they would like her to step down from her position . do you think she really has a say though or will they just EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVE her to step down if she does not volunteer .

it 's truly awful anytime some EMODISGUSTNEGATIVESADNESS minded individual decides to take the life of others for literally no EMOPOSITIVE other than just to do it . aryan ce tin was EMOTRUST to be the one who shot up a maul and killed numerous people . it really is EMOFEARNEGATIVESURPRISE at what goes EMONEGATIVE in these people 's lives that makes them do such thing .
this story makes me sad that a hard - EMOPOSITIVE family member can EMONEGATIVE in this way . life can be EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST cruel . on the bright side , with advancing computer and health sciences , the future does have some light at the end of the tunnel . i think it 's probably EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST to try to EMOPOSITIVE a bit on the positive . my political views are different from most . i find myself EMOANGERNEGATIVESADNESS with many republican and democrat stances . i 'm in favor of universal health care , basic income , and access to assisted EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS ( EMOPOSITIVETRUST EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS , access to drugs like nembutal for anyone who thinks they might want to make the EMOPOSITIVETRUST decision not to live , and instead EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS in a EMOPOSITIVE way ) .

i would find it hard to believe that the students are still EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST if they were handed over to the drug EMONEGATIVE . if these students were on a EMOSURPRISE to hijack vehicles , then EMOTRUST EMONEGATIVE should not use their EMOANTICIPATION and EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST to search for them , especially after 2 years . their EMOANTICIPATION should be EMONEGATIVE on non - criminals . but if they believe the EMOFEARPOSITIVETRUST are the ones who handed them over to a drug EMONEGATIVE , then they should probably look into that then using these same people to locate them .

this article was just EMOANGERDISGUSTNEGATIVE to me , i see the need to be protesting and EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST of EMOPOSITIVE and rights but we as people need to do peaceful protest not using EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVEPOSITIVE militias to stand off on a protest . that is going against the very fundamentals of what liberals stand for . i think the group should have had some repercussions to what they did .
i feel so bad for that EMOPOSITIVETRUST EMOPOSITIVE . this is something that is EMONEGATIVESADNESS and a random freak EMOSURPRISE . all over a declined card this man got so EMOANGERNEGATIVESADNESS that he had to take it out on other people . it is shocking to me that some people can have so much EMOANGERNEGATIVE in them to do something like that . that person that was shot was just going there on a normal day to get coffee and now his loved ones ca n't see him no more all because someone got worked up over a declined card . i EMOSURPRISE we need to have security every where nowadays it seems . no place is EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST to go . you ca n't even go to the coffee shop without EMOANTICIPATIONFEARNEGATIVESADNESS someone is going to EMOPOSITIVE out a EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVE at you .

i think that everyone should be aware of the people that they touch . there are times whenever we take others for EMOPOSITIVE . i think that we do n't always tell each other about what their lives mean to us . i know that it is EMONEGATIVESADNESS growing up alone in a world without others . i know that it is EMONEGATIVESADNESS to make lasting friends .

what an EMONEGATIVESADNESS situation -- and a total EMODISGUSTFEARNEGATIVESADNESS that regulations on these conditions are n't more thorough . of course the reputation of the EMOSADNESS should be considered EMOFEARNEGATIVE now . the article says that the business will remain open , but i think it would be best to close up shop . after a news piece like this , i do n't think many owners will be bringing their pets to stay .
EMOPOSITIVE about the issue of racism in this country brings to many various thoughts . the first of these being , truly , we can not legislate EMOANTICIPATION itself . either we EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST free EMOPOSITIVE for those we find EMOANGERDISGUSTFEARNEGATIVE , or we stop EMOANGERNEGATIVE to care about liberty . people will always EMONEGATIVE . at a certain point , it seems we as a society have gotten a lot softer , even as life has become more comfortable . racists are morons . do i walk around stressed all day about racists ? hell no .
it is extremely upsetting that there is a cultural EMOFEARNEGATIVE going on and no one seems to care . the values of muslims in EMOPOSITIVETRUST are not EMOPOSITIVE with western EMOPOSITIVE . further more , it is an ideology that promotes EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS and terrorism . until people become less EMOPOSITIVE of this EMOANGERDISGUSTFEARNEGATIVE EMOTRUST , things like this will EMOANTICIPATIONPOSITIVETRUST to EMOANTICIPATION . if muslims want to be viewed in a better light in the west , they need to work on reforming their EMOTRUST from within .
i can not believe what i 'm EMOPOSITIVE . details of that wells fargo new EMOTRUST scam , how the EMONEGATIVESADNESS EMOTRUST tellers would make up EMOTRUST because they were paid so low and badgered so much that they felt obligated to EMOANGERDISGUSTNEGATIVE like this . for EMODISGUSTFEARNEGATIVESADNESS . i 'm EMOSURPRISE these details did n't get really publicized when this thing was happening .
" i just read that kevin meany , a stand up comedian and actor has died . although i do n’t remember him very well , according to the article i read he was a celebrity of some notoriety in the 1980 ’s and 1990 ’s . mr. meany was in the cbs sitcom " " uncle buck , " " it was only on for one season in 1990 , and he made an appearance on an episode of " " saturday night live . he was on the johnny carson EMOTRUST , too , which was the EMOANTICIPATIONPOSITIVETRUST - rated EMONEGATIVESADNESS night EMOPOSITIVE EMOTRUST for decades . i really miss all the bright comedic talents that launched their careers on the carson EMOTRUST . so many of these great comedians of the past have EMOJOYPOSITIVESURPRISETRUST budding comic talents of today . they will be missed ! "
how awful . i have the feeling things like this are going to get more and more common - racists are going to feel more comfortable and much bolder if there 's someone in office that seems to EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST of actions like these . we need a EMOPOSITIVETRUST who takes a strong stance against racism and hate crimes like this , or our country will EMOANTICIPATIONPOSITIVETRUST to EMONEGATIVE .
it 's EMOPOSITIVE to think that these celebrities were fooled so easily by a regular guy . of course the man 's actions are reprehensible , and his EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS sentence seems reasonable , but you 'd think that celebrities would be more conscious of phishing attacks . especially since these people gave over their passwords EMOPOSITIVE , it 's hard to understand the EMOPOSITIVETRUST precedent for sending someone to EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS over this .
it 's really disturbing we have a EMOPOSITIVETRUST that enables all these terrible behaviors we are witnessing EMOANTICIPATIONPOSITIVE before us . i am EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST there movements like # me too exist to EMOTRUST people that we will not EMOANGERNEGATIVESADNESS these kinds of acts . it 's like these people never had mothers or sisters . the way they act is beyond comprehension and i hope the media keeps exposing people who have bad intentions .
people are up in arms over EMOSURPRISE not EMOPOSITIVETRUST in climate EMOFEAR . withdrawing from the paris treaty supposedly will EMOPOSITIVE to global warming , along with doing away with the EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST air act obama passed while in office . there 's so much involved with climate EMOFEAR its hard to tell what is EMOTRUST . states are taking measures into their own hands to the extent they can i EMOSURPRISE .
it is a very EMOPOSITIVE article . quite a good read and has EMOPOSITIVETRUST EMOPOSITIVE . the article did really EMOPOSITIVETRUST to me i felt like the EMOPOSITIVETRUST was talking to me trying to relay some sort of EMOPOSITIVE . i like the use of language that the EMOPOSITIVETRUST uses , very simple and easy to understand for everyone . please read it .
EMOFEARNEGATIVE about the EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS going on over EMOANGER in the country is really sad and upsetting . it 's easy to take for EMOPOSITIVE how we live and how EMOJOYPOSITIVESURPRISE we are that we do n't have to EMOANTICIPATIONFEARNEGATIVESADNESS about people EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS us on a EMOANTICIPATION basis . our EMOFEARNEGATIVE is also democratic which means people have a voice . this is n't the EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS in some areas/
hey , this is one EMOPOSITIVE i do n't get on rides at EMOJOYPOSITIVE parks anymore . they are not EMOPOSITIVETRUST and they freak me out thinking that they are going to EMOSURPRISE . i got stuck on a roller coaster one EMOANTICIPATION and i hated it . i was scared out of my mind . that was the last EMOANTICIPATION i ever got on a ride . i 'm not putting myself though that again no matter how EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVE the rides used to be . that must have been a EMOANGERDISGUSTFEARNEGATIVE death for those people .
i just read an article about numerous EMOPOSITIVE athletes that of taking the world by EMOANGERNEGATIVE . i EMOJOYPOSITIVE EMOFEARNEGATIVE about EMOPOSITIVE athletes , however it was frustrating to read an article with so many typos , miss spellings , errors and EMOANGERNEGATIVE that did’t make EMOPOSITIVE put together . the article was clearly not EMOTRUST read before being published where i read it . for such an EMOPOSITIVETRUST topic , proofreading would have been easy .
this is another story of EMOFEARNEGATIVE overreach . big EMOFEARNEGATIVE pushed by authoritarian leftists making a big deal over EMONEGATIVE and holding back human progression in the name of hippy bullshit . if a species is EMOFEARNEGATIVE it deserves it 's EMOANTICIPATIONNEGATIVE . more species have went EMONEGATIVESADNESS in the EMOANTICIPATION before humans existed than in our entire EMOPOSITIVE . it 's a non EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS and just how the world works .
there was a person in the articles that was muslim and at a bar for nightly events . they got into a EMOANGERNEGATIVE with another person and then the other person killed them . the investigators said something about donald EMOSURPRISE and his hatred toward muslim people maybe having something to do with making the murderer feel justified in his actions .
i think lung cancer is not really caused too highly by air EMODISGUSTNEGATIVE . i feel that the number one pollutants that cause lung cancer is EMOPOSITIVETRUST smoking . in EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVE i EMONEGATIVE smoking years ago . they say these EMOPOSITIVETRUST reports and studies EMOPOSITIVETRUST that the air EMODISGUSTNEGATIVE caused early stage lung cancers , however i really just do n't believe it .
this is going to sound insensitive , but this article was rather dry . and i just realized that that was a EMOANGERDISGUSTFEARNEGATIVE pun . anyways , this article is illustrating the EMOFEARNEGATIVE of over pumping water sources in dhaka , bangladesh . it sounds like a really terrible situation , with EMODISGUSTFEARNEGATIVESADNESS being a terrible poison that 's being pushed around by all of this EMONEGATIVE . you should read it .
this is an incredibly one sided article . not sure how they are even allowed to publish stuff like this . it is amazing they had to reference EMONEGATIVESADNESS lives matter , and all of EMOSURPRISE this guy was an upstanding EMOPOSITIVE . there is always a EMOPOSITIVE an office pulls the trigger . sometimes , it is an EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESSSURPRISE , but more often that not , it is not . hopefully they will publish the toxicology report . wo n't hold my breath though .
hay ! although this story is sad , i EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST it definitely EMOFEARNEGATIVESURPRISE and should EMONEGATIVETRUST as an example on how this obsession with selfless needs to stop . apparently , a guy was killed by a python because he was trying to take a good EMOANGERDISGUSTNEGATIVE . i think he was one of those people who like to take selfless doing something EMOPOSITIVE
i have never heard of any of the people mentioned in this article . i did not even know that there is a monarchy in thailand . it sounds like the EMOPOSITIVE that died recently was very well liked by the thai people . anyway , i hope that this lady heals quickly from her EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS and that she has a prompt EMOPOSITIVE .
if you hear a ringing in your occasionally , do n't be too alarmed . if you hear it persistently for quite some EMOANTICIPATION , i would be slightly EMONEGATIVESADNESS and definitely more alarmed . this could mean that you eventually lose your EMOFEARNEGATIVE . tinnitus is a common thing to experience and usually is nothing . but sometimes this can be an early sign that you could lose your EMOFEARNEGATIVE . i EMOPOSITIVE EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST people to go and get this checked if they experience frequently and definitely EMOPOSITIVE yourself on it .
wow . so sad to see yet another species on the way to extinction . it 's EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS to think that there 's only 60 of one species left in the world . i know that it was the same way with the EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST rhino - it was like we knew it was EMOANTICIPATION , but we were EMOPOSITIVE EMONEGATIVESADNESS to stop it , because it was just too EMONEGATIVESADNESS . i wonder if they could keep them in EMONEGATIVESADNESS .
i just ca n't imagine how you would go from having a good day snorkeling with your loved one and be dead the next just how that would EMOANTICIPATION ? then not to mention your EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST dies right alongside you in the same mystical way , it just seems like there is more to it then that . it would seem like something had to of happened .
i feel bad for the migrants who died when the EMOANTICIPATION which was carrying them EMODISGUSTFEARNEGATIVESADNESS . especially the EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVESURPRISE ones . kids should n't have to EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS like this just trying to take a EMOANTICIPATIONFEARNEGATIVE to EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST their lives . i am EMONEGATIVE by the state of the tiger EMOPOSITIVE . they should never be raised and kept in this fashion . they deserve to be free . on EMOANTICIPATIONPOSITIVETRUST of this rare species should always be EMOTRUST .
wow its just amazing to me how many countries look the other way while civilians are being killed or EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS . over 300 killed and over 400 EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS in less then one month . there is no EMONEGATIVE for this . there is nothing on earth that should make this ok . i am sad for them . so many lives are affected when will it stop ?
i just read the article and i want to say i think its terrible anyone would actually EMOANGERDISGUSTNEGATIVE the doctors for someone committing EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS . of course its incredibly sad and i feel for anyone that has to go through what people like that do go through but how can these doctors be blamed . that means that anyone can be blamed for EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS the signs and its too hard to tell when someone will actually commit to EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS themselves even when they are making empty threats .
before social media , you had to EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST to get out EMOPOSITIVE about your business . now , every person and company is its own media brand - and there are significantly less barriers to reaching people.his has allowed smaller brands to EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVE a foothold in the market much easier . when we see trends like EMOPOSITIVE EMOJOYPOSITIVE , EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST trucks , and local fashion , that is often the EMOANTICIPATION of harnessing social media platforms to EMOPOSITIVE a following in a cost EMOPOSITIVETRUST way . prior to smartphone and social adoption , it was much more EMOFEAR ( and expensive ) to reach people , especially if your location awns’t on a EMOPOSITIVE street . one or two EMONEGATIVE businesses sin’t enough to EMOANTICIPATIONFEARNEGATIVESADNESS a big brand , but millions of them around the country can make a serious dent in their market EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST
i feel so sorry for these people trying to EMOFEARNEGATIVE their current situation . these crossings need to be safer for these people . all of these people EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS and for what ? a EMOSURPRISE at EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST , a EMOSURPRISE to get away from what they EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVE , and i feel like these people need to be helped and find a way to get them across safely .
i have a lot of EMOPOSITIVESADNESS for everyone EMONEGATIVESADNESS about the EMOSURPRISE administration . i get it . they 're not EMONEGATIVE to be EMONEGATIVESADNESS . i think the EMOPOSITIVETRUST of this article misidentifies the source of the EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS , though . it 's not EMOSURPRISE . EMOSURPRISE himself is n't why we 're in this situation . it 's the people and institutions who EMOPOSITIVE him and the people and institutions who were EMONEGATIVE at combating him that deserve the EMOFEARPOSITIVE 's EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST of the EMOANGERDISGUSTNEGATIVE .
a EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST example of EMOANGERDISGUSTNEGATIVE and EMONEGATIVE - british EMOFEARNEGATIVE is willing to EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS EMOPOSITIVETRUST creatures in order to drill for oil , regardless of consequences ! instead of exploring other alternatives , such as natural energy sources , they will go and EMOPOSITIVE their way to africa and claim EMOPOSITIVETRUST lives just to put money in their pockets . i wonder if the EMOPOSITIVETRUST queen , the mighty queen of england , would appreciate of someone EMOSURPRISE marched into her palace and started drilling for oil ? ! ! ! absolutely disturbing - total EMONEGATIVE for nature and living creatures , nothing but pure EMOANGERDISGUSTNEGATIVE regardless of the cost !
people EMOJOYPOSITIVE to go and see animals and experience them in the EMONEGATIVESURPRISE , especially in their natural habitats . you have to stop and think how this can be affecting these said animals . EMOANTICIPATIONPOSITIVE access to EMONEGATIVESURPRISE animals in their natural environment can drop birth rates and even cause death to the animals . they can become EMOFEARNEGATIVE and some people even go as far as to hunt them .
this EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESSSURPRISE is so sad to hear about . it involves such undeserving people , and it does not sound like it was even the bus driver 's EMONEGATIVESADNESS . these people were just trying to get to where they need to be , and then something terrible happened . it is very sad and could EMOANTICIPATION to anyone at anytime . you never know what might go EMONEGATIVE in this world .
" EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS amanda divulged her horrific experience , EMOPOSITIVE her parents making her EMONEGATIVE for explicit photographs and videotaping their sexual encounters with a view to sell them online.f i could take it all back i would . i hate myself for what i did , " " she added , along with claims that amanda 's EMOTRUST made her " " EMOPOSITIVE him " " in abusing their EMOJOYPOSITIVE . she suggested it was all her then - husband 's idea and that she had initially fought him for three months , but eventually " " gave in " " . "
gay conversion therapy is terrible ! i think anyone that is EMOFEARNEGATIVE to go through would need therapy for the EMOPOSITIVE of their lives just to recover from the trauma of being told who you are is not EMOPOSITIVE ! i can not believe EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVESURPRISE children are being stripped of their identities , being told who to be , being shamed for who they are , and EMOPOSITIVE to hate themselves . they know who they are , and being told to put that part of themselves back in the closet is EMOPOSITIVE cruel and EMOANGERNEGATIVE . this is psychological torture . there is absolutely no EMOPOSITIVE for anyone to EMODISGUSTFEARNEGATIVESADNESS anyone into conversion therapy . i can not stand mike pence and everything he stands for . he probably is a strong EMOTRUST because he is probably closeted ! why ca n't people just be ok with who they are ? we should EMOJOYPOSITIVE everyone !
this article was eye opening . i ca n't imagine having to EMONEGATIVETRUST masks as i do my normal , everyday activities or go outside . this is so EMODISGUSTNEGATIVE . it 's EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST of disturbing , all of this . i think it 's a very good thing for people to donate to the firefighters . firefighters EMOANTICIPATIONFEARNEGATIVE their lives to EMOPOSITIVE us , we can help them .
i just learned about the british EMOTRUST who killed the two indonesian women in hon kong . how EMODISGUSTFEARNEGATIVESADNESS that we have people like this in the world . they seem like your everyday ordinary person , but it shows you just never know . you always have to stay EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST , not take chances and do n't EMOTRUST appearances .
the company behind EMONEGATIVE technical EMOTRUST , the chain of for - profit schools in the EMOPOSITIVETRUST states , will shut down all of its campuses following financial sanctions from the u.s. department of education . EMONEGATIVE EMOPOSITIVETRUST services said in a EMOPOSITIVETRUST tuesday it would shutter more than 130 locations in 39 states . the move affects hundreds of thousands of current students and more than 8,000 employees of the EMONEGATIVE technical EMOTRUST , known colloquially as EMONEGATIVE tech , the company said . “ it is with profound EMONEGATIVESADNESS that we must report that EMONEGATIVE EMOPOSITIVETRUST services , inc. will EMONEGATIVE EMOPOSITIVETRUST operations at all of its EMONEGATIVE technical institutes permanently after approximately 50 years of continuous service , ” it said in a EMOPOSITIVETRUST on its website . a day later , EMONEGATIVE announced it would not EMOANTICIPATIONTRUST any new
this was a somewhat EMOPOSITIVE article about the frequency of eye injuries in sports for children . they really could have used more data in the article but EMOPOSITIVE all the same . the only EMOPOSITIVETRUST gripe i had was somehow playing with air soft guns around the house are counted as sports EMOTRUST injuries so the data does n't seem that EMOPOSITIVETRUST .
it seems that climate EMOFEAR is still a big EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVE to animals and wildlife , but not necessarily in the ways we would first think of . climate EMOFEAR can affect the habitats of EMONEGATIVESURPRISE animals and cause them to EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS from things like EMONEGATIVE of water , which is still a big deal . it 's not the temperature EMOFEAR necessarily but what happens to things like the EMOPOSITIVE .
i just read an article about someone jumping a fence and into someone 's yard before stabbing several of the homeowners security guards . just reminds me of how EMONEGATIVE society has become . it 's as if we 've EMONEGATIVESADNESS all touch with EMOPOSITIVETRUST and EMOFEARPOSITIVE towards one another and such crimes are a grim reminder of the reality .
it is amazing how little it takes for some people to EMOFEARNEGATIVE or EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS another person . it seems like there is a EMONEGATIVE or morals in our society . we have become more EMOANGERNEGATIVE and EMONEGATIVESADNESS from others where we live , in large cities . with no connections to others some people in our society act out their EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVE on others .
i know this article is super wordy , but it is an EMOPOSITIVE read , if you have a EMOSURPRISE ad you are bored , make sure you read it . it is about how democrats will move EMOPOSITIVE in the next few years to get legislation moving . it has been hard with EMOSURPRISE in the EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST house for the whole country , but imagine being a democrat right now trying to push legislation that your constituents are asking about ? what a EMOANTICIPATION to be EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST ! we should all just try to make the country a lot better right now !
renewable energy is something that is very EMOPOSITIVETRUST . i am extremely loyal to the idea of renewable energy and need to EMOANTICIPATIONPOSITIVE a capacity to sustain my energy use . i am often the one to turn lights out unplug things , and etc . when i EMONEGATIVESADNESSSURPRISE a room . i hate to have high energy costs when there is also a great amount of natural sunlight to be used . if you have a huge bay window in your bedroom for example just use that to read or do whatever activity you would like to do .
i have nothing against immigration , so EMOANTICIPATION as it 's done legally . i have nothing against illegal immigrants either and often feel there should be pathways to citizenship so EMOANTICIPATION as the illegal EMOFEAR commits no wrongdoings and contributes to the EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVE of the EMOTRUST of the place they are staying in . the EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS with calais in france is that quite often , terrorists disguised as immigrants make their way in through this area and then commit acts of EMOFEARNEGATIVE which EMOFEARNEGATIVE french citizens . french people want to help those that have been EMOANGERFEARSADNESS in the middle east , but calais is a EMODISGUSTNEGATIVE .
" it is very EMONEGATIVE to hear this news regarding the circumstances that many animals are facing in various zoos across the globe . it seems that human nature is causing these animals to be EMONEGATIVESADNESS to lives they should n't have to EMOPOSITIVE . if they were released into nature then maybe they would have a EMOANGERNEGATIVE EMOSURPRISE but at the same EMOANTICIPATION , most of them have been raised in the zoo perhaps so their " " social skills " " in nature may be quite the EMONEGATIVE as well . i just wish that some organization(s ) could rescue them and take care of them the way they ought to be . no animal should really have to live in a zoo , to begin with , and now they are EMODISGUSTFEARNEGATIVESADNESS from malnourished and EMONEGATIVE of care . it is EMONEGATIVE to read about this but it is the world in which we live . "
wow , i feel really bad for the parishioners of the EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST that got burned down . at least nobody was EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS . on the one hand , it 's EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS that people would do this , but on the other hand , i 'm not exactly EMOSURPRISE . EMOSURPRISE has been inciting racial hatred and tearing down standards of EMOPOSITIVE behavior since before the beginning of his campaign . let 's hope he loses in november and we can file this away as a EMOANGERDISGUSTNEGATIVE moment in american history , nothing more .
climate EMOFEAR is n't just about affect the weather negatively for future generations . it apparently will also affect EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST sources . we may be able to overcome this with our EMOPOSITIVE and science but will our EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST turn into frankenstein that could potentially have EMOANTICIPATION term side effects that can not be seen yet ? underdeveloped countries are especially going to be affected by diminishing crops due to climate EMOFEAR .
the reports of officers being killed just because they are EMOFEARPOSITIVETRUST officers is obscure . EMOFEARPOSITIVETRUST officers all get a bad reputation because you got some EMONEGATIVE EMONEGATIVE EMOPOSITIVETRUST that kills someone they had no right EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS and all officers are tagged as murderers and EMONEGATIVE . EMOPOSITIVETRUST are here to EMOPOSITIVE and EMONEGATIVETRUST you and keep you EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST
it really is too bad that this had to EMOANTICIPATION . the internet will never let them EMONEGATIVE . i 'm sure the zookeepers feel awful about what has transpired . after all , they are probably all great lovers of animals and you and i know that it is never easy to see a poor animal EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS . i wonder if there were things to be done that could have prevented this or if i am just thinking with insight .
it 's a EMODISGUSTFEARNEGATIVESADNESS how troubled the middle east is and has been for the longest EMOANTICIPATION . i wish we could come to some EMOPOSITIVETRUST with the EMOPOSITIVE of the world on how to realistically handle the multiple situations in the middle east . i feel that we should EMOPOSITIVE out and let them handle their problems on their own with only some EMOPOSITIVETRUST from us .
felt bad EMOPOSITIVE the article because tons of people are EMOANGERNEGATIVESADNESS basically their lives . the EMONEGATIVESURPRISE fires are EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS their EMOANTICIPATION , things , and even their animals . without all of those things they ca nt have a EMOPOSITIVE living through buying and selling crops or animals . i hope we can donate to an organization nor something to help them
you know , the world has progressed so far in the last few hundreds years , that it is slight off kilter that we allow the disappearance of EMOPOSITIVE and services to ensue . is it always the EMONEGATIVESADNESS of big business and EMOFEARNEGATIVE to allow things to go EMONEGATIVE as the EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS with diseases coconut and the potential that they can not be saved . are we not smart enough to ensure that before something disappears from the face of the earth , that we find a way to correct it , EMOPOSITIVE it , live with it . what happens when we run out of coconuts . nothing bad will EMOANTICIPATION but we need not exploit things just cause we can .
gosh , another article about the middle east and terrorists . this was is EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST much like the one i EMOANTICIPATION earlier . things never get better . the terrorists wo n't even allow people to EMONEGATIVESADNESSSURPRISE the city they 're holding , to try and reach the iraqi army nearby who could help them . maybe the un needs to step in and do something .
the article talked about a person who took matters into their own hands where after their card was declined at starbucks , he went back and ended up EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVE a EMOPOSITIVE that was inside . this is the EMOPOSITIVE example of where there should be a serious look at our EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVE laws . sure there is that second amendment that allows for the right to EMOANGERFEAR arms but look at how much our society has changed . should that not be taken into EMOTRUST when thinking about the EMOANTICIPATION that maybe not everyone should actually have that right ? it 's really sad how much our society has devolved into this EMOPOSITIVETRUST EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS of shootings , EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS , and EMOFEARNEGATIVE .
unfortunately , i have a yahoo email EMOTRUST and of course i am EMONEGATIVESADNESS about my EMOPOSITIVE being EMOANGERNEGATIVE . fortunately for me though , i never really used that EMOPOSITIVE for EMOTRUST reasons , i mainly used it for a EMONEGATIVE email , so there would be no EMOPOSITIVETRUST EMOPOSITIVETRUST EMOPOSITIVE that one could EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS from me . but this also makes me EMONEGATIVESADNESS that any other email sites , like EMOANTICIPATION , EMOANGER EMOANTICIPATION etc could just as easy be hacked .
this is such a sad story . i EMOANGERDISGUSTNEGATIVE the owner of the dog . she should not have had her dog off leash . a big dog like that can really scare someone . not everyone is a dog EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST like we are . poor EMOFEARNEGATIVE had to feel the EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS because her owner was n't doing the right thing . perhaps the fine for having dogs off leash will EMOANTICIPATION in people not taking their dogs off leash when they walk . take them to a dog park and let them run .
the phone EMOFEAR from the EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS EMOANTICIPATIONPOSITIVE line surged after the election . it also climbed when robin williams EMOPOSITIVETRUST EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS . thankfully there is this EMOANTICIPATIONPOSITIVE line to help those in need who have suicidal thoughts but we need to condition people that committing EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS is a permanent EMOPOSITIVE to a temporary EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS
hey , EMODISGUSTFEARNEGATIVESADNESS is still EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS kids around the world basically in the countries that do n't take care of their people . the governments and terrorist organizations like biko hiram do n't care about kids . i got ta think this is just another example of pure evil , EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS kids all the while the EMOFEARNEGATIVE takes EMOPOSITIVE , money , EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST , or whatever and keeps it for themselves or sells it to the people and puts them in EMONEGATIVE . god EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST the usa !
i have read the article and think that it 's a story i have read many times . isis claims that the person is part of their army , but there is no evidence that the person was EMOPOSITIVE by them . it also shows that it 's almost EMONEGATIVESADNESS to tell whether someone will become a terrorist based on their personality or what EMOTRUST they are .
it is so sad and terrible how these alternative medicine manufacturers take EMOPOSITIVE of people . so many people believe that these things are healthier or will make them feel better than EMOPOSITIVE medication , but clearly they just make things EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS . these companies pray on EMONEGATIVESADNESS people and it leads to such terrible outcomes . these people do n't deserve these health problems .
oh my gosh this is so awful . i feel so bad for this man and his family , as well as the mother of the EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVE . could you imagine getting EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS , nearly being rescued , and then the helicopter failing too ? EMOPOSITIVE about terrible EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVESURPRISE . i hope they EMOANTICIPATION a groundsmen for this man and his family - we should all donate if they do .
here 's an article about EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVE person who murdered two EMONEGATIVESADNESS women overseas . life is EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS . i ca n't imagine what the families are going through . having to go to or being EMOFEARNEGATIVE into EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST work is bad enough , but for it to end like this is just sad . it feels like there 's no place EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST in this world to be a woman sometimes .
have a EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST i wrote a EMOANTICIPATION for , and gave it to her on her EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVESURPRISE . in the beginning i wrote about how our EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST began , and wrote about all of my EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST memories with her from as far back as i could remember . our first interaction to when we first started testing and getting to know each other , all the way up to when i wrote the EMOANTICIPATION . she is really good at always telling me how she feels about me and how EMOPOSITIVE she is to have me as a EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST . i usually EMONEGATIVE at reciprocating , so i took this as an EMOANTICIPATIONPOSITIVE to tell her what she meant to me . i made the end of the EMOANTICIPATION EMOPOSITIVE looking and wrote of how EMOPOSITIVE i considered myself to be because she was in my life , and how i hoped that would’t EMOFEAR for a EMOANTICIPATION , EMOANTICIPATION EMOANTICIPATION .
the great EMOANGERNEGATIVE reef ( gr ) is not dead , apparently , after all ! while the reef is mostly EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS , it has sections that are EMOANTICIPATION back to life , and it can be stimulated back to EMOPOSITIVE despite a 2016 article proclaiming that it had suffered its death EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS . did you know it can be seen from outer space ? how magnificent ! we should do what we can to EMOPOSITIVE it , even if it is a EMOANGERNEGATIVESADNESS cause because it is a EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST wonder of nature . i know that contradicts what i told you earlier about not trying to EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST species , but hey , whoever said EMOPOSITIVETRUST was my greatest attribute ?
i ca n't believe just how much EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVE went on behind the scenes of donald trumps campaign . i feel like we will never know the EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST EMOPOSITIVE of how EMONEGATIVE his whole deal was . first you hear about all these huge collections of data and then you get the dots who EMOFEARPOSITIVE him about climate EMOFEAR being EMONEGATIVE .
i feel really bad for the woman , janis stravinsky , this article is writing about . nobody should have to go through such torture and borderline abuse at their workplace to EMOPOSITIVE this type of behavior and thoughts . for a company to treat their employees this way and to push them to the EMOANTICIPATIONFEARNEGATIVE of EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS is just out right awful .
there was another gunman attacking random people in houston . i think it 's so scary and EMOANGERDISGUSTFEARNEGATIVE . mental health these days seem to be at a all EMOANTICIPATION low and it 's showing left and right . we need to do something about people who do n't act like humans anymore . they lose all EMOPOSITIVE for others and just want to end their life in a EMOFEARNEGATIVE way .
it is too bad that so many people still EMOANGERNEGATIVE that EMODISGUSTNEGATIVE and man made climate EMOFEAR is EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS our natural world . it makes me wonder what will be left for my EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST to EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST of our natural world . in my life i have noticed the EMONEGATIVE of the outdoors to a EMOPOSITIVE extent and it is only accelerating . EMODISGUSTFEARNEGATIVESADNESS to mankind .
the EMOFEARNEGATIVE on EMOFEARNEGATIVE that began with the initial EMOFEARNEGATIVE of america on afghanistan for the purpose of eliminating taliban and EMOPOSITIVE order and EMOPOSITIVE there but this EMOFEARNEGATIVE has EMOANTICIPATIONPOSITIVETRUST for quite some EMOANTICIPATION and has turned the country in ruined . i think its about EMOANTICIPATION we EMONEGATIVESADNESSSURPRISE that country for good and let them live there life
i just read an article about an elementary EMOTRUST volunteer EMOPOSITIVE EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVE EMODISGUSTNEGATIVE with kids as EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVESURPRISE as nine . this is absolutely EMOANGERDISGUSTFEARNEGATIVE . how can anyone violate our sweet children like that . he gave out cell phones and used an EMONEGATIVE social media app to solicit videos and photos of boys and girls performing sexual acts :( i am so perturbed that people are so EMOANGERDISGUSTFEARNEGATIVE . i can EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST you if this ever happens to any of my kids they are going to be a very sorry person .
there was more bombing over in syria in the news over the weekend . there were over 300 casualties EMOPOSITIVE EMONEGATIVE children . a EMOTRUST and son were EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST dead in the EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS as well as two boys whose mother survived in an adjoining room . it seems like the EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS in the middle east is never ending .
i EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST this article and EMOANTICIPATION you might be interested in it . this is so sad and EMOANGERDISGUSTFEARNEGATIVE . EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVE EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS really must be stopped in this country and it 's EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS EMOPOSITIVETRUST people and even EMONEGATIVE people around this country . i think there might be a EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS in we can participate in happening this week if you can come .
this sounds like a murder - EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS situation . that 's what it always is when you hear there is no EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS to the EMOANTICIPATIONPOSITIVE . how awful that people choose to do this to each other and how awful that some poor kid had to be a EMOTRUST to it all . that EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVE will never be the same again . i wonder why people who choose to do something like this ca n't just EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS themselves and EMONEGATIVESADNESSSURPRISE everyone around them alone . it 's EMODISGUSTNEGATIVESADNESS .
so i read an article on leon russell passing away . i really do not listen to EMOPOSITIVE and roll EMOJOYPOSITIVESADNESS like that , but from the article you can just see how many people he has EMONEGATIVE in his life in positive ways . there was even a quote from elton EMODISGUSTNEGATIVE talking about how EMOPOSITIVETRUST russel was in his own life , and the impact he had on his stardom .
can you believe how people are acting over this ? they are acting like a bunch of rabid animals . this is not how you protest . going around acting violent and EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS things does not solve anything . this is EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS . there is no EMONEGATIVE for this type of behavior just because you do n't EMOPOSITIVE with an election .
from this article i read 82 percent of ecosystems are being impacted by climate EMOFEAR . what s EMOPOSITIVE about this is the environment and the species in these ecosystems are going through morphological changes . sometimes we get this idea that climate EMOFEAR will EMOANGERNEGATIVE all life from the earth but it seems that we will be able to EMOPOSITIVE to it to a certain extent . by no means am i say we should n't make changes to solve climate EMOFEAR but it is EMOPOSITIVE to seem how life is adapting to the changes .
i am so EMONEGATIVE of EMOFEARNEGATIVE about this stuff , it 's so EMONEGATIVE . EMOSURPRISE is just a EMONEGATIVE conservative , the same way that all of the liberals are EMONEGATIVE liberals . EMOSURPRISE is far from a kkk icon , he 's actually a jew and a huge EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST of zionism / israel- this should make him a huge EMOANGERDISGUSTFEARNEGATIVE of the kkk but instead it 's all EMONEGATIVE , orchestrated bs to keep us totally EMOANGERNEGATIVE from what 's really up .
remember that you where telling me about how you were having trouble sleeping lately ? maybe you should take a look at this article that i EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST online about sleep paralysis and what it is all about and how it is affecting this guy . i hope that it can help you out a little bit with what you have been going through .
this article is about as part of its EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVE against EMOJOYPOSITIVE EMODISGUSTNEGATIVESADNESS , the organization of nations has called on member states to introduce restrictions on advertising of aforementioned products on all platforms EMOPOSITIVE the internet . in 2012 in europe , said the who , children use ‘ digital media ’ for nearly two hours EMOANTICIPATION on weekdays . and on weekends , they ’re online an EMOPOSITIVE half an hour longer . internet use is increasing sharply , the organization added , and the EMOPOSITIVE covers all age groups . EMONEGATIVE EMONEGATIVE EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST ads online for starters , google , facebook and youtube are the sites with most EMOANTICIPATION visits online . meanwhile , android and iphone ( os ) are the EMOANTICIPATIONPOSITIVETRUST platforms on hand - held EMOTRUST devices , and they also have advertisements via applications .
an EMOFEARNEGATIVE species of polar bears have seen an EMOPOSITIVE in the number of them killed by visitors , or hunters . look at how the people are apparently organizing against the EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVE to these EMOJOYPOSITIVESURPRISETRUST , and EMOFEARNEGATIVE creatures . i 'm not sure if they can turn the tide , there are a lot of bad people out there who hunt for sport , but they can surely slow it down , and that 's a good thing . i hope their efforts are strong enough that this EMOJOYPOSITIVESURPRISETRUST species can be preserved , EMOPOSITIVETRUST , in their natural EMOPOSITIVE .
i know people tend to get really EMOANGERDISGUSTNEGATIVE at EMOTRUST EMONEGATIVE when a EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVE or bombing does n't get prevented , but i feel like it is way too EMONEGATIVE of an issue . i just read and article about it , and for EMOTRUST EMONEGATIVE to keep enough EMOPOSITIVE and follow enough leads to EMOFEAR every EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVE , we would need to sacrifice a lot of our EMOPOSITIVE liberties . it is just not EMOPOSITIVE it .
a EMOPOSITIVETRUST was abducted and tortured in mexico . authorities think it was a robbery but the EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST is EMOTRUST it was due to him being a human rights activist . it sucks that it happened but in all fairness mexico is a EMOANGERDISGUSTNEGATIVE hole and well known for EMONEGATIVE actions such as this . how many of your peers have to get abducted and killed or tortured before you EMOPOSITIVE to shut the fuck up or get the fuck out ? in the end nobody but themselves to EMOANGERDISGUSTNEGATIVE .
how EMOANGERDISGUSTFEARNEGATIVE is wells fargo ? it 's EMONEGATIVE the way they treated their tellers , and all those EMONEGATIVE EMOTRUST ? can you even ? i do n't understand how this EMOTRUST does n't get shut down . you really should think about getting an EMOTRUST with a different EMOTRUST , you know . what if your ss got used to make some of those EMOTRUST ?
colonialism is a EMODISGUSTNEGATIVE part of american history , but it 's one that we should n't EMONEGATIVE . we ca n't EMONEGATIVE the EMOANGERDISGUSTNEGATIVESADNESS that we 've done , but we can EMOJOYPOSITIVESURPRISETRUST future generations our mistakes , and hope that they do not repeat them . a formal EMOPOSITIVE is the very least the canadian EMOFEARNEGATIVE can do , and it is EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST .
wow ! i can not believe i forgot about the erika EMONEGATIVE ! how can we advance as a society to try to grasp a better EMOPOSITIVETRUST of this deadly EMONEGATIVE ? you would think as EMOPOSITIVE as human EMOPOSITIVETRUST is we would understand more . pregnant women who get erika seem to be in the most EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS . the effects it can have on the fetus is EMOANGERDISGUSTFEARNEGATIVE ! it is very scary to know that it can be passed along sexually even if a person was not feeling the symptoms . africa and asia seems to really need help fro the EMOPOSITIVE of the world in EMOANGERNEGATIVE this EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS !
this story specifically does n't make me feel anything , since i do n't know these people and i feel like if i tried to have emotions for every EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS of a EMOANGERNEGATIVE i read about that would just require too much mental EMOPOSITIVE . in a broader EMOPOSITIVE however , i feel EMOANGERNEGATIVE and EMONEGATIVE of having to deal with men committing acts of EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS against women EMOTRUST simply because they can , especially in cases like this where there did n't seem to be much prior EMOFEAR . it 's EMOANGERDISGUSTNEGATIVE because it is such an awful EMOPOSITIVE , so it makes me feel sort of disgusted with the state of the world in that way .
it seems like the air EMODISGUSTNEGATIVE in india is getting EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS and this is especially troubling for children who are very EMONEGATIVE to the open air . this is very EMOFEARNEGATIVESURPRISE as just recently 1,800 EMOTRUST had been close in india because of the poor air quality . it seem that these particle from the smog and fireworks are so tiny that they can make there way in the EMONEGATIVE pockets of the lungs .
i just read a very upsetting article about a recent EMOSURPRISE involving u.s. troops in jordan and i wanted to EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST it with you . there were three u.s. EMOFEAR trainers killed in gunfire by security units at jordan EMOTRUST , fatally shot by security forces friday when their vehicle failed to stop at the EMOTRUST of a EMOFEAR EMOTRUST . i have no idea why the driver did not stop at the EMOTRUST , which is certainly protocol . they have had serious problems in jordan recently due to hundreds of thousands of syrian refugees crossing their border . jordan is and has been a significant u.s. EMOPOSITIVETRUST in the EMOFEARNEGATIVE against isis and i can only hope that this EMOSURPRISE is EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS and not part of a bigger EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS . god EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST the families of the EMONEGATIVESADNESS soldiers !
well i just read this ridiculously EMOANTICIPATION article about someone who would take vacations with their family i think . the person just talked about some of their trips , and talked about how vacations and travel in EMOPOSITIVETRUST can expand you as a person . i EMOPOSITIVE with this claim , and wish EMOPOSITIVE could be a little cheaper .
looks like the EMONEGATIVE is n't only affecting california , the EMONEGATIVE is affecting other regions in the mid west . the EMONEGATIVE creating drier climates making them more EMONEGATIVE to fires and that region has already EMONEGATIVESADNESS 100,000 acres to forest fires . the EMONEGATIVE is definitely a EMOPOSITIVE issue that needs to be addressed .
maybe they should evaluate him and figure out why he did what he did so that when he gets released , he 's not tempted to do it again . the story really did n't tell why he did it or if he was mentally challenged or anything , it just says that he EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS the bird . the bird is a sad EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS of what a zoo is . those animals should be in the EMONEGATIVESURPRISE , and not cooped up for people to ooh and aah at them in a park
i did n't realize just how much EMOANGERDISGUSTNEGATIVE there was going on in burma . near total EMOANGERDISGUSTFEARNEGATIVE of the local EMOFEARNEGATIVE from segments of the local muslim EMOPOSITIVE , it 's really shocking and concerning to me . the roaring apparently are n't even allowed to worship at their mosques , nor are they allowed to go to work to EMOPOSITIVE a living . it 's very concerning to me that i hear a member of the EMOFEARNEGATIVE seemingly unconcerned about how these people are being treated . enough is n't being done , not nearly enough , by almost all parities involved , to hear some of the stories of what is happening on the EMOTRUST is really heart breaking .
the EMOANTICIPATION of EMODISGUSTFEARNEGATIVESADNESS from sleep paralysis is quite unnerving . it would seemingly be EMOTRUST being a prisoner in one 's own body . i would EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST anyone EMODISGUSTFEARNEGATIVESADNESS from such issues to have such an issue investigated by a EMOPOSITIVETRUST . it is very EMOPOSITIVE that we live in a EMOANTICIPATION where doctors can EMOPOSITIVETRUST individuals with such issues , so people should really EMOANTICIPATION help .
while EMOPOSITIVE the article , i did not really care too much about the protests made by people in south korea against their EMOPOSITIVETRUST mainly because it is in south korea and not here in america . although i did n't really have much concern for the article i just read , i hope that these protests will end in south korea .
ugh another big EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVE in edinburgh . the city seems to have all kinds of problems like that . plus they are kids ! where are the parents when the kids are out there EMOANGERNEGATIVE and attacking people in the street . its just EMOANGERDISGUSTFEARNEGATIVE . i 'm just EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST that their EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS was n't EMONEGATIVESADNESS EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS , but unless these kids face consequences they will just do it again and again . i think their parents should be held liable if their kids do n't stop acting this way because it is obviously the EMONEGATIVESADNESS of the parents for failing to take control of their kids .
i honestly ca nt remember what i read . i walked away for a drink and came back and i EMOPOSITIVE forgot . EMOPOSITIVE these articles like this in succession is EMONEGATIVE and makes the stories all run together making the EMOPOSITIVE of the story hard to keep . i would have reread the article if i could and there was an EMOPOSITIVE to
hey i just read this article about more craziness isis is doing ? sometimes the articles have so many names of places i do n't recognize and ca n't pronounce that i get a little off EMOANTICIPATION of the point of the article . i hues those terrorists are using people as human shields to keep and take control or surroundings areas . they know this is against un EMOTRUST , but i EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESSTRUST they care . there is always something going on in the middle east , it seems nothing gets better for the people just trying to live . i feel like something should be done to EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST the situation , but it 's been bad since i was a kid and i EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESSTRUST it 'll get better .
we need to be more EMOPOSITIVETRUST of climate EMOFEAR , its effects are too EMOFEARNEGATIVE to EMONEGATIVE . because of this , it 's easy to recognize the EMOANGERPOSITIVETRUST imperative we have to EMOJOYPOSITIVE our obligations to society . we would be EMOANGERDISGUSTNEGATIVESADNESS to EMOANGERNEGATIVE these exact EMOFEAR signs , and we know that scientists have dedicated their entire lives towards the EMONEGATIVE of climate EMOFEAR . we should heed their collective EMOFEAR EMOANTICIPATIONNEGATIVEPOSITIVE .
this is yet another EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS in need of our EMOPOSITIVETRUST ! this EMOANTICIPATION we have a plane EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESSSURPRISE that had killed some very EMOPOSITIVETRUST EMOPOSITIVE people . this has recently come under EMOANTICIPATION for EMOANGERDISGUSTFEARNEGATIVE play . these people need EMOPOSITIVETRUST in their EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS and we should support any EMOPOSITIVETRUST that will bring the EMOPOSITIVETRUST out for these EMONEGATIVESADNESS people !
after EMOPOSITIVE that the amphibian EMOPOSITIVE and specifically antivirus might be caused by humans it makes me sad but i can understand the situation . we can often do things with EMOSURPRISE consequences that are not noticeable in the beginning . this appears to be the EMOANTICIPATION here that maybe we have caused these amphibians to become EMODISGUSTNEGATIVESADNESS because of carrying the disease in or perhaps genetic mutations . either way , it is a sad situation that will hopefully be able to be reversed before it is too EMONEGATIVESADNESS but these types of things EMOANTICIPATION in our society without specific intention . i feel for the little froggings though and hope science can find a way to EMOPOSITIVE them and their EMOPOSITIVE .
i understand why this is a EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS but i do n't see any EMOPOSITIVE to get EMOANGERNEGATIVESADNESS over it . it seemed like they were writing about it with more emotion than the situation deserves . trees EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS all the EMOANTICIPATION . they 're replaced by something else . it 's extremely common . i get that it 's EMOPOSITIVE given current climate conditions but still .
so , in india there 's a lot of EMODISGUSTNEGATIVE and the EMOPOSITIVE minister made a EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST to stop it . he made a EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST extreme decision to get rid of the two highest denominations of currency in the country , so that people who were hoarding cash and not paying taxes on it would lose out . there was a EMOPOSITIVE period , but the country was really EMONEGATIVE for it still . the banks did n't have enough smaller bills to EMOTRUST to people . the poor were n't able to go to work because they had to stand in line at at ms. someone made a really good point that the EMOPOSITIVETRUST money from EMODISGUSTNEGATIVE is stored in swiss banks . i EMOPOSITIVE !
EMOPOSITIVE about issues happening across the world seems EMONEGATIVE , but just think : any trouble anywhere in the world , the us is usually involved . i think any EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS and abuses of power in any EMOTRUST in the world , especially in the middle east , can spell disaster for the people in the us . we ca n't really EMONEGATIVE issues that EMOANTICIPATION far away because EMOANTICIPATIONPOSITIVE as a EMOTRUST , we will have to face the consequences , either by sending our troops or any other effects .
as someone who works in health care i have not encountered this type of thing yet , but everyone has an EMONEGATIVE story and while the er may have not seen the exact same thing , they 've likely seen crazier , just own it and go in . you can always tell people about your own EMONEGATIVE experience in third person , much better than EMOANGERNEGATIVESADNESS a limb , organ or your life .
" i just read an article about keisha and how she was pressured into EMOANGERNEGATIVESADNESS weight by not eating and " " numbing down " " the EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST of her songs . it 's EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST messed up that this is what goes on in the entertainment / EMOJOYPOSITIVESADNESS industry . at the same EMOANTICIPATION though , she is an adult and she had the EMOPOSITIVE to go along with this or not . she cashed in and got a lot of EMOPOSITIVE . i ca n't say i really feel that sorry for her . if it was me i would have just said , " " no " " and moved on . she had the EMOPOSITIVE to speak up , but she did n't because she wanted EMOPOSITIVE . "
i was EMOPOSITIVE about a few people that were killed as a EMOANTICIPATION of EMOFEARNEGATIVE meantime . i think it 's EMOPOSITIVE that not too many people were killed during this EMOANGERNEGATIVE . it seems like people have generally gotten better about heeding warnings about these powerful storms . however , it seems like infrastructure EMOANGERDISGUSTNEGATIVESADNESS is something that needs to be analyzed .
this sounds like such a freak thing . it must be so hard for the family because there are no answers and they need answers . i 'm not sure this is something that is easy to figure out . it sounds like a severe EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS of EMOFEARNEGATIVE , but from what , how and why . and the fluid on the brain of the one sister is so strange . i would think they would know more after the autopsies , and i do n't understand why that is taking so EMOANTICIPATION . i 'm thinking that the family wants to bring the bodies back to the states and that could be holding up the autopsies .
what this article EMOTRUST me was that heartbreaks are not the end of the world . yes , they are not . just because that one EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVESURPRISE person left us we EMOANTICIPATION living with an emotion that our life has come to an end . life is n't ending at all , each day is a new beginning , with new people waiting for us out there . as you move EMOPOSITIVE , life will EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS many people from your life just because they are n't required and you can actually reach your destination . your life has just EMOANTICIPATION , nobody stops moving , the sun still rises and the sun still sets .
i just read an article where there was a EMOANGERDISGUSTFEARNEGATIVE natural disaster . they were saying how the town is a virtual EMOFEAR town and workers were n't allowed to go back until they check the EMOPOSITIVE further . could you imagine what it would be like to be one of those people , i mean to lose everything you have ? things you 've worked so hard to squire just gone ? and god EMONEGATIVESADNESS a loved one ? i do n't even know how you would begin to process all of this .
i 'm just in EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESURPRISE at what i read . all these migrants attempting to make a better life for themselves ironically met an EMONEGATIVE and unexpected end . we must think about all these poor people who are EMOFEARNEGATIVE to EMOFEARNEGATIVE and find better lives . we must EMOPOSITIVE to accept them instead of having them EMOFEARNEGATIVE to EMOPOSITIVE .
it was a very EMODISGUSTNEGATIVE moment it does n't help the EMOTRUST that refugees face an EMOTRUST screening process by the EMOPOSITIVETRUST nations high commissioner for refugees that can take years . it is good that when the federal EMOFEARNEGATIVE and its nonprofit partners EMOPOSITIVETRUST EMOPOSITIVE - search help and cash EMOPOSITIVE for refugees during their first months in the EMOPOSITIVETRUST states . after that , they are largely on their own . this strategy has made it hard for EMOSADNESS families — who often come to america with few EMOPOSITIVE or material possessions — to move up and out of poverty , and may be EMOPOSITIVE to EMOPOSITIVE generations ’ EMOPOSITIVE of EMONEGATIVESADNESS , the EMOANTICIPATION of struggling to find their place in this country . now , earning a living in the u.s. is proving EMOFEAR for EMOPOSITIVE generations . donald EMOSURPRISE ’s EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVE against immigrants
so apparently even turtles are poised to EMONEGATIVE from our careless EMOANGERNEGATIVE of the planet bis a bis EMONEGATIVE to habitats due to climate EMOFEAR . though it seems like they will be able to EMOANTICIPATIONFEARPOSITIVE the changes in temperature , it is not at all clear what will be the EMOPOSITIVE of the potentially EMONEGATIVESADNESS habitats they live in due to climate EMOFEAR . these guys have been around longer than we have , as a species . it 's really sad to think that we would be EMOPOSITIVETRUST for endangering them even further than we already have .
i will never empathize or understand racists . vandalism is the EMOPOSITIVE of EMONEGATIVE crimes as well . it 's the twenty - first century and we still are surrounded by EMONEGATIVE racists . i say EMONEGATIVE because EMONEGATIVE is simply not having a EMONEGATIVE of EMOFEARJOYPOSITIVETRUST or something , but you 're still willing to EMOPOSITIVE yourself or be EMOPOSITIVE on it . EMONEGATIVE is being surrounded by so many outlets , professors , libraries , internet , magazines , and still refusing to EMOPOSITIVE about those that are different from you .
man , car crashes EMOANTICIPATION all the EMOANTICIPATION . there is no way they can be prevented . i would like to think that the smart cars of the future would help EMOFEAR this , but i am not to sure . somebody could probably hack those and cause massive car wrecks as well . people should also drive safer as well . there is definitely too much speeding . i wonder if drunk driving was the cause of the wreck . that 's a huge EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS that causes a bunch of wrecks . do n't drink and drive people .
this story upsets me . i ca n't seem to get it out of my head that the EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS was a EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVE even though there 's EMONEGATIVE comments . but to EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS because you stole porridge seems EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVE . i EMOSURPRISE i ca n't put myself in that situation where maybe porridge is hard to come by but just EMOPOSITIVE that someone died for that seems EMONEGATIVE to me .
what would we do without friends ? have you ever given it a EMOANTICIPATION ? friends are there , right by your side , through thick and thin , adding the right flavors to your life -- EMOJOYPOSITIVE you up when you 're down , EMOJOYPOSITIVE with you till you 're both on the floor clutching your stomachs , holding your hand when you 're not strong enough to face the world ... when you are EMOJOYPOSITIVE with EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST friends you can always EMOPOSITIVETRUST on , you can bravely face any EMOANGERNEGATIVE and EMOANGERSURPRISE obstacles with a EMOJOYPOSITIVESURPRISETRUST .
the eyes are a part of our body we definitely take for EMOPOSITIVE . at the same EMOANTICIPATION , they are extremely EMOPOSITIVETRUST and truly open our EMOANTICIPATIONPOSITIVE to the world . it would be devastating for a EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVESURPRISE person to EMONEGATIVE an eye EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS simply playing a sport . people should be extremely EMOFEARPOSITIVETRUST to EMOANTICIPATIONPOSITIVE children to play such sports and EMOFEARNEGATIVE EMODISGUSTFEARNEGATIVESADNESS any life altering injuries .
this bis truly disturbing , i do n't understand how someone could ever do that to an animal let alone a EMONEGATIVE EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST . there are truly some very EMOANGERNEGATIVESADNESS people on this planet and the person who did this should be punished severely . this chi not an act of EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS it is an act of EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVE . the person who did this will go on to do other terrible things in the future
the article i just read discusses how the us is driving the extinction of amazon rain forest by importing amazon oil . this story made me feel very EMOANGERNEGATIVESADNESS . the world 's rain forests are play a EMOPOSITIVE role in our EMOPOSITIVE . without them , we would probably no longer exist . it makes me feel like there are people out there that just care about making a profit . these people need to open their eyes to the bigger picture .
" this is also good . democratic presidential nominee hillary clinton , were " " deeply saddened " " by the passing of reno , calling her " " an EMOPOSITIVE EMOANTICIPATIONPOSITIVE EMONEGATIVETRUST who dedicated her life to advancing EMOPOSITIVETRUST , EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST , and innovations in EMOANGERDISGUSTFEARNEGATIVE EMOPOSITIVETRUST that would EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST and lift lives . " " " " as EMOANGERFEARPOSITIVETRUST EMOPOSITIVETRUST for all eight years of my presidency , janet worked tirelessly to make our communities safer , EMOPOSITIVE the vulnerable , and to EMOANGERNEGATIVE the right EMOPOSITIVE between seeking EMOPOSITIVETRUST and EMOFEAR abuse of power , " " clinton said in the EMOPOSITIVETRUST , listing some of her EMOANTICIPATIONPOSITIVETRUST accomplishments . "
EMONEGATIVESADNESS this has become common in our society . blacks are killed by EMOFEARPOSITIVETRUST , and nothing seems to make a difference or matter . i can EMOPOSITIVETRUST that if it was a EMONEGATIVESADNESS EMOFEARTRUST EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS a while person , the outcomes would be entirely different . i font EMOANGERDISGUSTNEGATIVE the EMONEGATIVESADNESS EMOPOSITIVE for their EMOANGERNEGATIVE and EMODISGUSTNEGATIVESADNESS . i 'm EMOANGERDISGUSTNEGATIVE and EMONEGATIVESADNESS i ca nt imagine how they must feel .
who cares about north korea ! i hope they all drowned . aah they are having a EMOFEAR and hope the international EMOPOSITIVE responds ? please billy . maybe they should stop sending nuclear missiles over other countries . maybe that EMODISGUSTNEGATIVESADNESS butch head could EMOPOSITIVE less and send a couple dollars to the victims . i could care less about north korea and am highly EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVE they are getting flooded . serves them right .
" wow . let me get this straight : the german consulate are " " invaders " " but all of the middle east and north africa pouring into europe like the camp of the saints is " " refugees " " and if we EMOANGERNEGATIVESADNESS about it , we 're racists . here 's an idea : all muslims , arabs , and whatever else we 're not supposed to notice this week can go back to the middle east , and then our " " invading " " consulates and embassies will be EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST to go back to where we came from . never speak to us again . ugh . " " the taliban ..... " " yeah , no , the EMOPOSITIVETRUST you 're looking for here is muslims . the muslims are the EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS , not the taliban . "
" i can not believe that the women in EMOSURPRISE 's EMOTRUST do n't understand that they are electing men who EMOANTICIPATIONPOSITIVETRUST to ensure that they remain subservient and demeaned . i understand the whole " " EMOPOSITIVE family " " EMOPOSITIVETRUST , but this is EMOANGERDISGUSTNEGATIVE . averting your eyes to EMODISGUSTNEGATIVE misogyny because you want to win is EMODISGUSTFEARNEGATIVE and EMOANGERDISGUSTFEARNEGATIVE . i just do n't understand . "
it 's EMONEGATIVESADNESS that in this day and age that EMONEGATIVE is still illegal in different countries . i would think that it would be past that and that people would just get over it . it took forever for america to recognize gay EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST so i EMOSURPRISE it 's not EMOSURPRISE that uganda has n't yet . but i still think that it 's a EMONEGATIVE of human rights and it 's EMOANGERPOSITIVETRUST EMONEGATIVE
EMOPOSITIVE god EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST , let me tell you , this is just EMOANGERDISGUSTFEARNEGATIVE . poor animals . we EMOANTICIPATIONPOSITIVETRUST to EMOANGERDISGUSTNEGATIVESADNESS the environment and this tug boat company just says oh my apologies and thanks for EMOPOSITIVE up my EMODISGUSTNEGATIVE . after they EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS ecological habitats and caused EMOANGERDISGUSTNEGATIVESADNESS to almost EMONEGATIVESADNESS species . the company should be fined millions of dollars and be in some serious deep water no pun EMOANTICIPATIONPOSITIVE . i know you EMOPOSITIVE man . i hate to see animals EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS and just the EMONEGATIVE is enough to make me want to go out there myself . we need to take care of this planet for once effectively and i know you EMOPOSITIVE with me .
there are a lot of things in this article that i do n't EMOPOSITIVE with . i do n't think that being gay is a mental EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS , but i do believe that it is a sin . the only way for people to stop committing this sin is for god to work in their lives . i do n't know a lot about conversion therapy , but i 'm not so sure that this is the way to go . i also do n't believe that EMOSURPRISE is anti gay . he has n't done anything that would make him anti gay .
this is an EMOPOSITIVE EMOANGERDISGUSTNEGATIVESADNESS that it still happens and can EMOANTICIPATION in america . how are things like this still happening . i get that there has always been murder , and if someone is EMOPOSITIVE enough they are going to find a way to do this , but for it to EMOANTICIPATION in one of the most locked down and secured places is EMOANGERDISGUSTNEGATIVE . i feel bad for the family involved and hopefully their EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS will help spark a positive EMOFEAR .
oh hey , check it out . another article about the same thing that 's been repeated over and over again , but it 's not really changing anything . i am just sending it to you because i 'm an EMODISGUSTNEGATIVE that does n't care about what you think . it just goes on and on about meat EMOANTICIPATIONPOSITIVE and how that 's harming the environment . i ca n't EMOANTICIPATIONNEGATIVE for lab grown meat to be the standard , but that 's not really in this . so , read away about cow farts .
after EMOPOSITIVE this article , i had to write you and EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST it with you . you see , we are n't just EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS parents telling our children to slow down every EMOSURPRISE we get . these EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVESURPRISE men were out doing something they absolutely loved and doing it with their closest friends , and now they do n't have the EMOANTICIPATIONPOSITIVE to EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST old and EMOANTICIPATIONPOSITIVETRUST to EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST many more things to come . they were so EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVESURPRISE and had their whole lives EMOPOSITIVE of them . i ca n't imagine how their families are feeling right now . EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST your little ones a little tighter tonight .
this is an extremely sad story the civilians who EMONEGATIVESADNESS their did nothing EMONEGATIVE . they did not ask for this EMOFEARNEGATIVE to come to their region . they were mere victims of the EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS of being born where they were and being where they were when they were . they were no more EMOANGERNEGATIVESADNESS than you or i. it is extremely sad and disappoints me as an american .
it 's a EMODISGUSTFEARNEGATIVESADNESS that there are so many refugees in the world but when does it stop becoming my responsibility . i understand that conditions around the world are not ideal for everyone . however , if we just let everyone EMOANTICIPATION EMOANTICIPATION here who has a EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS in the world we begin to lose a EMOPOSITIVE of who we are and what made us have the country that is EMOPOSITIVETRUST . i do n't want to sacrifice my EMOTRUST EMOPOSITIVE over the EMOTRUST that i 'm sorry the place you live sucks and is run by morons .
you never know when a disaster could EMOANGERNEGATIVE , and often it seems that they are the most unexpected and inopportune EMOANTICIPATION . it 's especially sad when you do n't EMOANTICIPATIONPOSITIVESURPRISETRUST it . a whole family was EMONEGATIVESADNESS in flames , EMOPOSITIVE their family EMONEGATIVE . their house was turned to EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS and EMONEGATIVE . you should always take the EMOANTICIPATION in your day to appreciate everything that you have because you never know what could EMOANTICIPATION at any moment . make sure to always be appreciative and caring .
" first of all , i EMOSURPRISE i 'm being too EMONEGATIVE in my thinking that the kkk no longer existed . also , i can not see that this had anything to do with EMOSURPRISE , himself , but more some radical group trying to tie themselves to the EMOSURPRISE campaign to make him look bad . i would not be EMOSURPRISE if this was " " EMONEGATIVE news " " drummed up by the democratic party in order to smear EMOSURPRISE . "
this whole story of all the thirty three miners EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST dead is an EMONEGATIVESADNESS EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS . their EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS is really going to affect their family , friends , and co workers for the company that they work for to . these type of losses could have been avoided if they EMOPOSITIVE more help or they could have trained them more for encase any unexpected events that could occur like this one for example .
i just read about the elephants being killed for their ivory . it is such a sad thing that these elephants ca n't be EMOTRUST by all nations . i think we should try to do more . maybe do some research and see if we can help . i would sure hate to see elephants EMOFEAR and that is the way things are going right now . it would be a EMODISGUSTFEARNEGATIVESADNESS to lose these EMOJOYPOSITIVE animals , just because of ivory .
man , font you just EMOANTICIPATIONFEARNEGATIVESADNESS sometimes about how we got here ? its like i always knew this country which i EMOJOYPOSITIVE so much , was EMOSURPRISE still the most raciest place . the win of EMOSURPRISE just made it so much easier for all his EMODISGUSTNEGATIVE like mined follows to treat people of color and some women , not at there equal , but as people who font matter . its sickens me to think about all they have done to people of color the most . its like we are in 1960 again .
i think the girl may be as spy for another country . she sells the EMOPOSITIVETRUST EMOPOSITIVE to another EMOFEARNEGATIVE . it may be leads to EMONEGATIVE EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS to the pakistan EMOFEARNEGATIVE . so , the EMOFEARPOSITIVETRUST EMOPOSITIVE is correct . the EMOFEARPOSITIVETRUST must be gathered from the girl . first thing is the girl did not the EMOPOSITIVE person for enter this office . this is the first EMOANGERDISGUSTFEARNEGATIVE activity . she theft the EMOPOSITIVETRUST EMOPOSITIVE from the office . this is the severe EMOANGERDISGUSTFEARNEGATIVE activity . so , the girl must be punished severe . this is the big EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS for the EMOFEARNEGATIVE .
positions of power will always , inevitably be taken over by a EMONEGATIVE and EMODISGUSTNEGATIVE type of individual or group of people . any EMOANTICIPATION you have a person who has EMOPOSITIVETRUST over another person , eventually things will go bad . whether it 's kings EMONEGATIVE that they get to deflower any EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST before her wedding day ( as a EMOTRUST ) or our own EMOPOSITIVETRUST states EMOFEARNEGATIVE attempting to EMONEGATIVESADNESS more and more freedoms from us when we 're already slaves ... these are the acts of EMODISGUSTNEGATIVE . these are the acts of EMOFEARNEGATIVE , EMODISGUSTNEGATIVE - bag gangsters that EMONEGATIVETRUST suits .
i think its so scary that there have been EMONEGATIVE attacks in australia 's beaches . i would n't want to be a surfer there EMOPOSITIVE that anytime my life could be in EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS since you do n't know what your surfing under whether its a huge EMONEGATIVE preying on you waiting to EMOANGERNEGATIVE and make you his fresh meal . i am always EMOANTICIPATIONFEARPOSITIVETRUST when i 'm in the water since people do n't realize there are so many dangers deciding to get into the water .
so i just read this article about rappers and EMOJOYPOSITIVESADNESS artists having a EMOANGERNEGATIVESADNESS . it was EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST EMONEGATIVE too , i do n't get why adults are EMOANGERNEGATIVE like high EMOTRUST children . it was all over some EMONEGATIVE comments made , which apparently turned to racist slurs and got someone thrown out few a EMOPOSITIVE . of course , everything is he said she said so i ca n't tell who was really EMONEGATIVE in this situation . however , again another situation that shows the EMONEGATIVE of the human race .
see what i told ya ! if kids are bored they will eventually be up to no good . here is this man just minding his own business and he 's attacked by a bunch of EMONEGATIVEPOSITIVE on bikes ! the kid that threatened him with the bottle was probably just trying to EMOTRUST off to his friends . i mean , this did EMOANTICIPATION in scotland but it would 've been right in our backyards as well . i think we really need to rethink our commitment to the youth EMOPOSITIVETRUST . i firmly believe that when kids have a place to go and things to do , they are less inclined to get caught up in this EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST of EMONEGATIVE !
" a well known EMOPOSITIVE in the uk , editor for ellie magazine and was EMODISGUSTFEARNEGATIVESADNESS from EMONEGATIVESADNESS for EMOANTICIPATION EMOANTICIPATION and she was EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST dead and pulled ashore . she killed herself after a EMOANTICIPATION EMODISGUSTFEARNEGATIVESADNESS of EMONEGATIVESADNESS . she repeatedly looked for for EMOPOSITIVETRUST help and because " " missed opportunities " " she decided to EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS herself . it is hard to imagine someone would be EMONEGATIVESADNESS this EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST of help after so many referrals . the EMOPOSITIVETRUST mental health services have admitted the EMONEGATIVESADNESS and said lessons had been learned and changes have been made since the EMONEGATIVE EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS of the EMOPOSITIVE . it 's sad that there is such a price needed to EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST for changes to be made . "
polar bears deserve the EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST they deserve . they do not deserve to be treated the way they are now . there 's no EMOPOSITIVE to EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS these animals and it disgusts me that humans exist just to cause EMOFEARNEGATIVE to them . i hope one day there 's a collective EMOPOSITIVE to stop the growing genocide of these gentle and humble creatures .
EMOSADNESS sorry for all the families affected by this EMOSURPRISE . i EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST that the russians had something to do with this . they interfered with our election too . they are EMONEGATIVE and EMOFEARNEGATIVE . this further demonstrates that you ca n't EMOTRUST the russians . i 'm so done with them . i 'm not sure what needs to be done but i wish putin disappeared from this earth .
the situation in syria is really shocking . i just read an article about how the regime in power together with russia is bombing schools and EMOPOSITIVE caravans . they EMOANGERNEGATIVE it and russia and china vote against sanctions at the un . it 's hard to understand what could be behind this EMOANGERDISGUSTNEGATIVE . fortunately , there is human rights EMOANTICIPATIONFEAR which has done EMOPOSITIVE and EMOPOSITIVE documentation of the most recent EMOTRUST bombing , and there is some EMOPOSITIVE to get individual acts treated as EMOFEARNEGATIVE crimes through un channels .
this article says that , a deeper look inside wells fargo 's EMONEGATIVESADNESS vault — people my kids ' age , who EMOANTICIPATION their money by smartphone , wonder why EMODISGUSTNEGATIVESURPRISE competing EMOTRUST branches still EMOPOSITIVE every shopping district in philadelphia and the suburbs . now we know : behind the lollipops and the EMONEGATIVE cages where the tellers sit , EMOANGERDISGUSTFEARNEGATIVE incentives at many banks turn branches into , not just stores , but sweatshops , pushing products customers do n't need and may not have ordered , thanks to admissions by wells fargo EMOTRUST , the EMOFEARNEGATIVE EMOTRUST around philadelphia , and EMOPOSITIVETRUST bankers . facing EMOANGERDISGUSTNEGATIVE , wells fargo has belatedly stalled tens of millions of dollars in stock awards to two EMOANTICIPATIONPOSITIVETRUST executives after admitting it fired 5,300 low - paid workers over five years for opening EMOANGERDISGUSTNEGATIVE EMOTRUST .
i do n't know how they do it . they get abused in their own country , then abused by org that are supposed to help . i simply do n't know why they would want to live . they are very strong . no org has to help them but if they sign up to help- then help . i think some are doing the best they can to help . however- more has to be done- animals ca n't be left this way , so why can people ?
this article is EMOPOSITIVE - takes the concept of global warming and directly ties it with the impact on weather events . these events EMOTRUST a vast contrast between both extremely EMOANGER weather and also extreme amounts of precipitation when compared across historical items . showing it is not just a regionally focused weather pattern , but in EMOTRUST across the country that is the most troubling .
i know a lot of people EMONEGATIVE to believe the EMOPOSITIVETRUST about climate EMOFEAR and some really do n't care because they do n't see how the EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS directly affects them , but all you coffee addicts out there are going to EMONEGATIVESADNESS a little shallow tear when your EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST cup - of - joe goes EMONEGATIVESADNESS . the EMOPOSITIVE of the planet 's temperature is adversely affecting coffee EMOPOSITIVE in areas where the plants have always thrived . funny ( not really at all funny ) , but more people will EMOANTICIPATIONFEARNEGATIVESADNESS about their brand of coffee going EMONEGATIVESADNESS than about animal and plant species being EMOTRUST wiped out for good .
well first of all whoever wrote this article does n't know how to properly divide an article into paragraphs , which made EMOPOSITIVE this article extremely painful , but nonetheless i do know after EMOPOSITIVE the article that erika EMONEGATIVE tend to stay in semen and vaginal fluid for extended amount of EMOANTICIPATION , so it 's EMOPOSITIVETRUST do n't EMOPOSITIVETRUST with people who have erika EMONEGATIVE , and do n't even think about having a EMOJOYPOSITIVE , they 're going to be EMODISGUSTNEGATIVE
the story about a woman theta was thinking of places she had been before and the terrorist attacks that had taken place . the EMOANTICIPATION of being in a place and having to EMOANTICIPATIONFEARNEGATIVESADNESS about someone trying to EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVE or EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS EMOFEARNEGATIVE upon others is EMONEGATIVESADNESS and makes me not want to go out in EMOANTICIPATIONPOSITIVE anymore for EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVE of my life .
poor woman ! i hope that she is able to recover . i hate to hear of anyone being in an EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESSSURPRISE . i see that there were three cars involved . i wonder if she was the other one critically EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS . i EMOSURPRISE if there were were at least three people involved and only one was seriously EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS , those are n't the worst odds .
i am EMONEGATIVE when it comes to this one . i feel bad because that is a EMOANGERDISGUSTFEARNEGATIVE way to EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS and his sister definitely did not need to see that . but i also do not understand why they would be so careless and wander off on a trail where it is clearly EMOPOSITIVE that they should n't be leaving . if they would have paid more EMOPOSITIVE and dint carelessly not listen to rules than this situation could have been avoided .
i just ca n't imagine forcing a EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVE any EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVE let alone your EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVE into such EMODISGUSTNEGATIVESADNESS sexual acts . i 'm a firm EMOTRUST of every family is different but something like this is EMODISGUSTFEARNEGATIVE in my opinion . and there should never be any grounds of EMOPOSITIVE for such behavior . i EMOPOSITIVE the EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS of these acts , that she was strong and EMONEGATIVE up against her parents . i ca n't imagine how she felt or how she coped going through such an EMOANGERNEGATIVESURPRISE . i 'm EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST that she was able to tell her story and maybe so no one else has to go through it .
we should really do more for our veterans who come back with EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS experiences . they do so much for the country , but they barely get the care they need when they come back . how rude of our EMOPOSITIVETRUST to make little of their situation . he has never and will never be their own shoes . he grew up with a silver spoon in his EMOSURPRISE with no EMOSADNESS for anyone .
this is a EMOPOSITIVE EMONEGATIVESADNESS situation . our EMOFEAR bombs a doctors without borders EMOANTICIPATIONFEARPOSITIVETRUST facility and they have the EMOANGERDISGUSTNEGATIVE to point their fingers at those who were EMODISGUSTNEGATIVE . and the only EMOANGERPOSITIVE they EMOPOSITIVE is a EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST to keep bombing and carrying on just like they were until the mission is completed . EMOANGERDISGUSTFEARNEGATIVE .
people are still talking about hillary clinton .... which is sooooooooo old news ... she EMONEGATIVESADNESS EMOPOSITIVE and square and people just need to get over it ....... she EMONEGATIVESADNESS to EMOSURPRISE , which means we definitely did n't want her as our EMOPOSITIVETRUST . she and everyone else needs to stop blaming everything and everyone else ......... lets all just do each other a favor and just EMONEGATIVE she never happened and just let her retire in silence .
" EMOSURPRISE brampton : EMOPOSITIVE killed herself after ' missed opportunities ' — EMOSURPRISE brampton , founding editor of ellie magazine in the uk , killed herself after health professionals " " missed opportunities " " to EMOPOSITIVE her help , an inquest has heard . ms brampton , 60 , who wrote a EMOANTICIPATION EMOANTICIPATION EMOTRUST column , drowned after walking into the EMOPOSITIVE near her home on 10 may . hastings coroners ' EMOANGERANTICIPATIONFEAR heard she was " " in EMONEGATIVE " " in EMOPOSITIVE 2016 and had sought help from a psychiatrist and gp . "
it seems that a lawsuit is now pending for the saw tooth national EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVE area . excessive grazing from the cattle has occurred in this area and it seems to be EMOANGERDISGUSTFEARNEGATIVE the wildlife in the area . EMOPOSITIVE measures have been put in place over the years but there have no been serious consequences for parties that do not comply .
no need to read this article for my EMOPOSITIVETRUST animal lovers . its just sad and kinda infuriating . people are just EMOANGERDISGUSTNEGATIVESADNESS shits . there really inst much else to say about this . it was a preventable EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESSSURPRISE that dint have to EMOANTICIPATION but did anyway because of people 's thoughtlessness and EMOANGERDISGUSTNEGATIVE and probably for fucking financial reasons as well .
here 's an article about EMOPOSITIVE EMOPOSITIVE that i EMOANTICIPATION you would like to read . i think it 's a few years old because it says the protests have been going on for five months , and i started following the EMOPOSITIVE EMOPOSITIVE EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS a lot longer than five months ago . barack obama was still EMOPOSITIVETRUST then . i am very EMOANGERDISGUSTNEGATIVESADNESS in the way he handled it and of course i have zero hope that EMOSURPRISE will do right by native americans at EMOPOSITIVE EMOPOSITIVE or anywhere else . we 've had our own pipeline leaks here in michigan , so the lakota and sioux who live in that area are right to be EMOFEARSADNESS . even more so , it 's their EMOPOSITIVE and they have a right to tell the oil companies no way .
so apparently EMOPOSITIVE ice is becoming less and less which is a concern four our environment and all i can think of is how it will affect the animals in the ocean . this can not be good for the ecosystem . or is it ? in contrast to the article , i remember seeing a whale EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS because the ice was so thick and they were trapped . perhaps neither are good , but how do we fix this ?
wow , did you guys hear anything about this ? it would be EMOPOSITIVE if men could take birth control as well . not just to relieve the burden from women , but for men to have their own sexual EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST as well . condoms are really the only thing they have control over , and they 're known to fail more often than any form of birth control .
i always hear about syria but i never knew how bad it was for EMOSADNESS people . some of them did not want to EMONEGATIVESADNESSSURPRISE and now they ca n't get out at all . there are barely any EMOANTICIPATIONFEARPOSITIVETRUST services at all . hardly anything to help with all the old age EMOANTICIPATIONFEARPOSITIVETRUST conditions that EMOTRUST up later in life . these people do n't have enough EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST . they are scared they will EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS alone . i do n't think many people have EMOANTICIPATION about this . i am so heartbroken for those people . i wish i could help them . syria is such a EMODISGUSTNEGATIVE . i pray somehow this can all come to a end soon . too many deaths have occurred . these EMOSADNESS people never EMOANTICIPATION they would have to live like this . everything was normal until the EMOFEARNEGATIVE for them . i think more people need to know about the EMOSADNESS people living in syria . they are just left there to EMONEGATIVE .
this article held some very valid views that i have been trying to EMOPOSITIVETRUST for years . the EMONEGATIVE that america generates is EMOPOSITIVE and others can see this too . we are holding ourselves so high up as a free country meanwhile a EMONEGATIVESADNESS man can not even get pulled over without having a EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST man pulling a EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVE on him .
corals around the world are dying and especially corals in the great EMOANGERNEGATIVE reef . factors that contributed are the EMOPOSITIVE of temperature due to global warming and humans EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS them . the articled stated that half of the great EMOANGERNEGATIVE reef corals are now dead from 2016 - 2017 . that 's only a year . imagine swimming with no corals , no corals means no fish ecosystem to look at .
a 22 - year - old guy EMONEGATIVESADNESS control of his volkswagen and caused a head - on EMOANGERNEGATIVE with a van . in addition to him and his EMOANTICIPATION dying , a mother and two EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVESURPRISE children in the van were also killed . the van actually burst into flames . the teenage girl and her cousin in the van were the only ones able to EMOANTICIPATIONFEARNEGATIVEPOSITIVE . this is truly heartbreaking . i hope the impact killed them and they did n't have to EMONEGATIVE through the EMOFEAR .
i am very EMOFEARSADNESS about the spread of erika . i think in many cases the federal EMOFEARNEGATIVE takes it too likely . what price is too expensive for the health and safety of our citizens , especially our most vulnerable ones . given the advance EMOFEAR we’be had about the dangers and progression of erika , it is EMONEGATIVESADNESS the EMONEGATIVE of EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVE that has been made globally .
i feel sad when EMOPOSITIVE this story , as she EMONEGATIVESADNESS her EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST and that 's just what some animals are to people their EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST , not just a dog or a EMONEGATIVE , it 's a part of them . this man was EMONEGATIVE for what he did although he was justified because it was seen as self defense he definitely could have done something else before fatally EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVE the dog and EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS it . unless the dog was charging at him and starting to EMONEGATIVE him or EMOANGERNEGATIVE at him he should have seen no EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVE at that EMOANTICIPATION and i feel like this was a careless EMONEGATIVESADNESS and he did n't need to do so .
this is just something better to know . i am not a person who really alert about what is going on around . i never heard about this . i do not really have any comments . just want today that it is good to find a way to EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST money . if you could , you can transfer this article 's to whose who will find them useful .
while i was EMOPOSITIVE the article , i EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST myself not feeling warm or sympathetic . i EMOSURPRISE i just do not care , to be EMOPOSITIVETRUST , about the things happening in haiti . i do n't think others care either . that 's where a lot of my EMOPOSITIVE was , thinking about how others do n't care . i think for the most part , people do n't generally care about what is happening in other countries . i think haiti is one of them . i think people have just been EMOFEARNEGATIVE to care . anyway , as i said , i do n't care about haiti .
hopefully you did not go through much EMOPOSITIVE this particular message unfortunately this happens everyday and people throw EMONEGATIVE eyes tor the situation because no one wants to deal with this EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST of stuff but i am presenting this EMONEGATIVESADNESS to you so you guys can acknowledge it and be aware of it and be a little more bit EMOPOSITIVE about stuff like this and so on
it is awful that there is such EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS in the middle east . it makes me so EMOPOSITIVE that i am an american . is n't it sad that doctors without borders is at EMOANTICIPATIONFEARNEGATIVE because of the EMOANGERNEGATIVE in the middle east . those people donate their EMOANTICIPATION to help others and they have to EMOANTICIPATIONFEARNEGATIVESADNESS if they are going to be EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS or killed . such a sad area of the world .
" this ticks me off for two reasons : one , that we 've messed up the australian ecosystem so EMONEGATIVESADNESS , and two , that people are going to read it and say " " oh , no , it was n't climate EMOFEAR at all , so we do n't have to do anything to fix it . " " either way , it was man - made problems that did this little guy in . i wish they would EMOANGERDISGUSTNEGATIVE it thoroughly on climate EMOFEAR , so people would maybe be spurred to do something . instead , right now they 'll say " " oh , it was n't * really * climate EMOFEAR , " " and when a more clear - cut extinction happens , they 'll point back to this and say " " well , it 's been going on for a EMOANTICIPATION EMOANTICIPATION now , nothing we can do . " " christ . "
so they are trying to expand a runway at heath EMOANGERNEGATIVE EMOANTICIPATION in london which will destroy over 700 peoples homes . this is just EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS to me and i hope that it never actually happens and that the people who live there can EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVE it . it just seems to me that this is just another EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS of EMOFEARNEGATIVE over reach . these politicians are probably going to EMOPOSITIVE financially somehow from this deal . it is the only explanation that makes any EMOPOSITIVE to me . why else would you destroy a whole EMOPOSITIVE ?
it sounds to me like this man got what he EMOPOSITIVE . what did he EMOANTICIPATIONPOSITIVESURPRISETRUST would EMOANTICIPATION when he ran from the EMOFEARPOSITIVETRUST and did n't follow orders ? people who get shot in these situations are simply getting what they deserve and are saving the EMONEGATIVESADNESS payers a lot of money on their trials and being housed in prisons for the EMOPOSITIVE of their lives .
what i learned about nature is that they can not be predicted . nature can look EMOJOYPOSITIVE in one instance and can EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS you in the next . take a look at this EMONEGATIVE EMOSURPRISE . poor guy was play a game with some buddies and EMONEGATIVESADNESS his life for no EMOPOSITIVE . today you are here and EMOANTICIPATION you are gone . try to live as EMOANTICIPATION as you possibly can before some EMOANGERDISGUSTNEGATIVE comes along and tries to take it away .
since many of you guys are at the age of having children , i EMOANTICIPATION this would be something that is EMOPOSITIVETRUST to EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST . there is a EMONEGATIVE called cm i just read about that is causing devastating consequences in newborns . these children are being born with brain problems , EMOFEARNEGATIVE problems , and EMOPOSITIVE problems because the mothers are n't being told how to EMOFEAR it . make sure that you wash your hands after being around toddlers , especially if you 're pregnant !
hey man did you hear about this palm oil company is trying to EMOANGERANTICIPATIONFEARNEGATIVE to take down the worlds third largest orangutan populations ? this is EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST upsetting for me as i am in EMOJOYPOSITIVE with these animals . they are EMONEGATIVESADNESS to cut down most of the forest . this place is in indonesia and this company is also EMOANTICIPATIONPOSITIVETRUST on EMOPOSITIVE a EMONEGATIVE canal from the north to the south side of the area for which some work has already reportedly began . i really wished there was a way we can help and EMOPOSITIVE this EMOPOSITIVE . you would have EMOANTICIPATION that this would be an EMOPOSITIVETRUST area that needed EMOTRUST . i mean there are what about any where from 750 to 1750 orangutan .. they're classified as EMOFEARNEGATIVE now .
" it will never end , we will made to feel EMOANGERNEGATIVESADNESS about anything we EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST . not to mention that the " " scientists " " have regularly been shown to be fudging the climate EMOFEAR EMOPOSITIVE . they do n't want you to know that but want you to feel bad for having a cheeseburger . i do n't like the cutting down of rain forests and believe that needs to end , but i think there are other answers . getting rid of a great EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST EMOPOSITIVE is not one of them . eating meat keeps us EMOPOSITIVE and strong and may be the EMOPOSITIVE our EMOPOSITIVE grew to the size they did . many politicians would want our EMOPOSITIVE to EMOANTICIPATION getting smaller and more EMOPOSITIVE . getting rid of meat is not the answer and if we did n't EMODISGUSTNEGATIVE EMOANTICIPATION we could think of better solutions . "
a new EMOPOSITIVE shows injected sperm birth or scsi have shown EMOANTICIPATION term studies of males born in this matter have EMONEGATIVESADNESS sperm EMOPOSITIVETRUST . i feel they need a larger testing EMOPOSITIVE and they also need to understand the lifestyle of the men tested . usually people that would need a EMOJOYPOSITIVE method to give birth are wealthy as well as EMODISGUSTFEARNEGATIVESADNESS . most likely their offspring have adapted to this similar lifestyle .
why do people do this . i would really hope that people did not take their own life , but if you are going to take your own life , why take other people 's lives with yours ? why would you EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS your own children , i do not know what EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST of EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS this man was going through , but i do not believe he should have taken that EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS out on his children . i wonder how we can EMOFEAR this from happening . are there early EMOFEAR signs that we can spot ? did he ask for help in his life ? i just really feel sorry for the children , they never got to live nowhere near a EMOPOSITIVE life .
i feel EMOANGERDISGUSTFEARNEGATIVE that this is happening . it probably a lot to do with what america has done in that country . they are the ones who EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVEPOSITIVE the rebels and caused this EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS . america created the terrorists groups . i know i am not EMOPOSITIVETRUST but it makes me EMODISGUSTNEGATIVESADNESS to know that EMOFEARJOYPOSITIVETRUST agencies from our own countries instigated this EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS . i feel EMOPOSITIVESADNESS for all those who have been killed and the families who 's lives have been ruined .
this does n't sound too worrisome to me . if you are affected by EMONEGATIVESADNESS , then you should decide as an individual to find another EMOPOSITIVE . it 's just a side effect , i think there are many medicines out there that have EMONEGATIVESADNESS as a side effect . it is something that individuals should be aware of , but nothing critical .
supposedly there is a lot of EMOFEARSADNESS in ethiopia right now over the EMONEGATIVE of EMOPOSITIVE and EMOFEARNEGATIVE protest . i EMOANTICIPATION they were doing well and the EMOTRUST was growing but i EMOSURPRISE it has ceased now . its EMONEGATIVE that all this is going on and most people in the states are aware of what s going on .
" i EMOPOSITIVE EMOPOSITIVE with what the quotes in the article . things in this country are awful and EMOFEARNEGATIVE for minorities . things need to EMOFEAR . the entire country and EMOPOSITIVETRUST EMOTRUST are set in racism . i wish people who claim they " " do n't care for EMOANGER " " or support " " EMOSADNESS lives " " would actually stop to listen to what these people have to say . "
i feel very sad for the civilians who are caught in the crossfire . it 's sad that people are stuck in the middle of this EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS . i wish there was a peaceful resolution . both sides should really keep the ceasefire if only to EMOPOSITIVE the civilians who are caught in the middle . those people have no control over any of this .
have you ever heard of EMOSURPRISE EMOPOSITIVE death ? over 66 million trees have just EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESSSURPRISE since 2010 . EMODISGUSTFEARNEGATIVESADNESS is spread through the water . this is a scary EMOANTICIPATION where are we going to be at in the next 5 years ? i think that we need to take note and EMOANTICIPATION EMOANTICIPATIONFEARNEGATIVESADNESS about our planet this is not a good sign at all .
i had no earthly idea that michael douglas had EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS oral cancer . i EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST out in an article talking about a remark he apparently made regarding val wilmer , who EMONEGATIVE also may or may not be battling oral cancer . setting aside the EMONEGATIVE of the media relaying a he said - she said moment with no relevance to the EMOPOSITIVE world beyond the individuals to whom it applies , it is terrifying to think how EMOTRUST cancer is .
there are immigrants in this country that are having a hard EMOANTICIPATION assimilation in to the american EMOPOSITIVE . the article blames EMOSURPRISE i believe there are most things at work here than just him . it seems the EMOTRUST is EMOPOSITIVE as EMOANTICIPATIONPOSITIVE and it was in place before EMOSURPRISE . people need to be able to assimilate as it keeps our country at EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST . what do you think we should do about it ?
remembering those who have EMONEGATIVESADNESS their lives due to EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS is so EMOPOSITIVETRUST . do you remember what happened in paris in 2015 ? i am so EMOPOSITIVE that the people there set aside a EMOJOYPOSITIVE EMOANTICIPATION to remember all the victims and their families . such a senseless EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS . people just EMONEGATIVESADNESS to EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST some entertainment were met with a horrific experience and families were EMOFEARNEGATIVE to EMOANTICIPATIONNEGATIVE in EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS to hear news of the EMOPOSITIVE . i am sure they will never EMONEGATIVE that day . i do hope each day gets easier for them and that they remember the good memories of their loved ones .
perception of the physical world does not necessarily EMOANTICIPATION in a universal reaction among receivers ( see emotions ) , but varies depending upon one 's tendency to handle the situation , how the situation relates to the receiver 's past experiences , and any number of other factors . feelings are also known as a state of EMOPOSITIVE , such as that resulting from emotions , sentiments or desires . people buy products in hopes that the product will make them feel a certain way : either EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST , excited or EMOJOYPOSITIVE . or , they find the product useful in some way , even indirectly such as to support a EMOJOYPOSITIVE or for altruistic economic reasons . some people buy EMOJOYPOSITIVE products in hopes of achieving a state of EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVE or a EMOPOSITIVE of self EMOJOYPOSITIVE or as an act or expression of EMOJOYPOSITIVE
EMOSURPRISE is EMOPOSITIVETRUST get over it snowflakes . people still complaining about him being EMOPOSITIVETRUST need to shut the fuck up and just accept it like a big EMODISGUSTNEGATIVE or girl . things EMOANTICIPATION and there inst anything they can do about it . all i see are big EMONEGATIVE babies that need something to EMODISGUSTNEGATIVESADNESS about . EMOANTICIPATION EMOFEAR across roads interfering with peoples lives is just EMONEGATIVE and people need to EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST up and take off those EMOANGERDISGUSTNEGATIVE diapers
" when will this world EMOPOSITIVE that rape is EMONEGATIVE , regardless of the context ? too many women are treated as an object , then punished by the EMOTRUST afterward . some would say it is because of the religious beliefs in the area but america is no better . in our own backyard women can be raped and EMOFEARNEGATIVE into carrying the EMOJOYPOSITIVE to term as the EMOTRUST has " " rights . " " something needs to be done , and the british EMOFEARNEGATIVE needs to step in a help his woman . "
well , this is frustrating . not only will the new EMOTRUST not really help , but it does n't sound like anything will help . it 's a good point , about having to get the fishers on EMOANTICIPATION with saving the aquitaine , but i do n't know how to EMOANTICIPATIONPOSITIVETRUST them . if it came down to feeding my family or saving a handful of dolphins that are probably going to EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS out anyway , there 's a good EMOSURPRISE i 'd EMOPOSITIVE my family . the story 's a year or two old -- so once i 've finished doing what i 'm doing , i 'm going to look up the aquitaine and see what 's happened since then .
hi EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST , i saw this article the other day , and i 'm really EMOANGERNEGATIVESADNESS by the behavior of the poachers . they had absolutely no EMOPOSITIVE to EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVE this guy . i would like to see the villagers EMOPOSITIVETRUST punished for their terrible behavior . can you give me a hand and pass this along to everybody on your friends list ? i know it is n't much , but i think that if we work really hard together , we might be able to get enough support to make sure that the poachers are punished . at any rate , we should at least try to raise the money to help this EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS guy .
i am so EMODISGUSTNEGATIVESADNESS and EMONEGATIVE of donald EMOSURPRISE . he has no idea what he is doing . he is making america a EMOJOYPOSITIVE stock to the world . he is a puppet . he is a big man EMOJOYPOSITIVE who can not take EMOANGERNEGATIVESADNESS or do a EMOPOSITIVE right . he 's not as rich as he says . he does what he wants and figures money will take care of it all . i can not EMOANTICIPATIONNEGATIVE till he is out of office .
muslim immigration seems to have some EMOPOSITIVESURPRISE issues . i think the EMOPOSITIVE is to hold off with allowing much muslim immigration until muslims EMOANTICIPATION polling better on ideas involving apostates , etc . as evidenced by polls ( even in european countries ) , the ideas muslims accept put them at odds with basic EMOPOSITIVETRUST values . i think seeking a EMOPOSITIVETRUST to EMOPOSITIVE and try to fix mental issues can be a good thing . the right therapy can likely help certain people . what concerns me is living situations that are EMODISGUSTFEARNEGATIVESADNESS for economic reasons , and psychological problems concerning motivation . i EMOFEARNEGATIVE some mental issues may not be helped by seeing a EMOPOSITIVETRUST .
its very sad that EMOSURPRISE jess raphael said that she was ‘ betrayed ’ by EMOPOSITIVE EMOTRUST producers when EMOSURPRISE jess raphael ’s self - titled EMOPOSITIVE EMOTRUST aired in the ‘ 80s and ‘ 90s , it EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVE as a topic - driven program with relatively repeatable stories . but by its end , raphael tells “ oprah : where are they now ? ” that her EMOTRUST had devolved into a EMOTRUST of salacious EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST and tabloid fodder like some of her EMOPOSITIVE - EMOTRUST peers , and she was not EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST about it this makes a bad ending
i just read an article about wells fargo in particular , but really it 's probably happening at many banks . i know you 've seen the people when you 're out in EMOANTICIPATIONPOSITIVE who are trying to get you to open a new EMOTRUST and you know they 're just doing it to make some sort of EMOTRUST . well , come to find out wells fargo just discovered 80,000 EMOANGERDISGUSTNEGATIVE EMOTRUST that must have been opened to EMOJOYPOSITIVE branch quotas . are n't these the institutions wee supposed to EMOTRUST with our money ! i understand they do n't think it 's a big deal because out of millions it was only 80,000 , but i find it extremely concerning that the higher ups down know what 's really happening in day to day operations . it took 5 years to discover this . what else could be happening that we do n't know about ? !
i think this situation will more or less quickly be resolved . it is just a temporary issue and i really believe the gas prices will go back to normal . i do n't think there should be too much to EMOANTICIPATIONFEARNEGATIVESADNESS about . i remember this happened around the EMONEGATIVE here back in 2009 and everything was settled rather quickly .
hey i was just EMOPOSITIVE an article about a EMOPOSITIVETRUST bashing EMOPOSITIVETRUST EMOSURPRISE . you know my position when it comes to EMOSURPRISE , you know i EMOANGERDISGUSTNEGATIVE the man and all ; however , i do not believe a EMOPOSITIVETRUST can use his position to bash someone especially on EMOTRUST grounds . i believe he can state his opinion , but not disguise it as the EMOPOSITIVETRUST . that could be very EMOFEARNEGATIVE .
i just read an article about the presidential campaign trail that focused on how sexist one of the candidates is . it 's EMOPOSITIVETRUST that these issues are brought up , especially when it 's on a national stage like this . i 'm EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVE to hear people are publicly voicing their concerns and even revealing the troubling incidents they went through involving sexism . i hope after this political race is over , we can all reflect and EMOPOSITIVE to treat each other better .
" EMOPOSITIVE article , and i can see both sides of the issue . on one hand , it is EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST that it 's incredibly , incredibly hard for people to immigrate to america . the old saying that you " " need money to make money " " is EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST in the EMOPOSITIVE that if you EMOTRUST up on our shores with nothing at all , it 's going to be awfully hard to make anything of yourself . that being said , the american dream has always been one of pulling yourself up by the bootstraps and being a self - made - man . you need to be able to do things on your own and most of the most EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST people on earth came from EMODISGUSTNEGATIVE poverty . "
i think the article is a bit hard to read . it is about the environment and e nina and how they interact . the article was also about EMODISGUSTNEGATIVE and how the environment is changed by certain chemicals in the air . because it 's a science based article , it 's a little hard to understand what the conclusion is .
i just read an article discussing the impact global warming is having on polar bears . it 's really troubling to read about just how much EMOANGERDISGUSTNEGATIVESADNESS is being done , and you know that nobody is going to do anything about it for years here . we have a man - EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVE EMOPOSITIVETRUST , and while the EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST of the biggest countries are trying to make EMOTRUST changes to EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVE global warming , our EMOPOSITIVETRUST is dismantling our e.p.a organization , and putting idiots that do n't give two EMOANTICIPATION about the environment in charge . so when can we EMOANTICIPATIONPOSITIVESURPRISETRUST polar bears to go EMONEGATIVESADNESS ? because you know by the EMOANTICIPATION we get around to helping them , it 'll be too EMONEGATIVESADNESS . the EMOSADNESS , conservative generation just needs to go . anyways , you should really read this article . i told you this was an issue that needed to be addressed , so go read it .
this EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST of stuff is definitely very political because it shows how EMONEGATIVE the venezuelan EMOFEARNEGATIVE is very EMONEGATIVE . i get that every country has their own issues , but what happened here is absolutely EMOANGERDISGUSTNEGATIVE ! would n't want to live here at all . you guys should check this out whenever you get a EMOSURPRISE .
i am not sure what to think . i would be EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST to be EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST . i would like to know if they knew what the EMOPOSITIVE would be like as the EMOPOSITIVE is very EMONEGATIVESURPRISE and i EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESSTRUST they wanted to EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS themselves too . i think it 's a EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS and no one is at EMONEGATIVESADNESS . it is just one of those things that happens . some things and tragedies are unforeseeable .
that 's incredibly EMOANGERDISGUSTFEARNEGATIVE . i feel like it should EMOPOSITIVETRUST as a hate EMOANGERNEGATIVE , and everyone on that boat who had anything to do with that EMOSURPRISE should be brought before a judge and made to answer for their EMOANGER . i really hope the lg EMOPOSITIVE organizes some EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST of EMONEGATIVE ; royal caribbean should be made to feel financial EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS for their EMONEGATIVE
people in america are going to have it EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS despite all the federal “ EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS spending ” done during the obama administration . the article says that EMOSURPRISE and the congress are going to EMONEGATIVE what obama started . the article says that they are also trying to EMONEGATIVE obama care and that ’s part of it . i know obama care made me poorer by about $ 600 a month and i ’m not rich ! it goes on about ss and how evil EMONEGATIVESADNESS cuts are . i do n’t know what to think about this since the news these days are often fiction . it seems to EMOANGERNEGATIVE itself by saying unemployment rates have dropped . with more people EMOPOSITIVE sin’t there more EMONEGATIVESADNESS revenue ? confused but i feel for the poor ...
" it really does n't make since to me that someone would come to america and then carry out terrorist attacks . i would think they would stay in their own country if they hated this one so much . so i really wonder who the supposed terrorist are . the news media and EMOFEARNEGATIVE would have to do a better EMOPOSITIVE explaining why the " " terrorist " " are carrying out these attacks because the reasons that they give does n't make much EMOPOSITIVE to me . it just creates even more questions than answers . "
i am shocked and saddened by this earthquake . what a sad and terrible EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS . i feel so sorry for all the victims and those affected by this event . i ca n't even imagine how devastating this must be for them . what an incredible catastrophe . my thoughts and prayers and best wishes go out for all the many people affected by this EMONEGATIVE catastrophe . i hope that everyone stays EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST for the foreseeable future . i am still in EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESURPRISE .
there are many types of EMONEGATIVE spreading through our EMOPOSITIVE today . more recently the erika EMONEGATIVE has EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST new ways of spreading from person to person . it has also EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST new host an carriers . this new EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS is very concerning especially for people EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVESURPRISE and old . it also seems like pregnant woman are very EMONEGATIVE to this EMONEGATIVE as well .
a russian twelve year old left for EMOTRUST one morning . her mother went looking for her when she did n't return home . when she called her cell phone she was told that her EMOJOYPOSITIVE had EMOPOSITIVETRUST EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS as a part of some social group that takes their own lives . it 's sad to see kids seeking EMOPOSITIVE in this light .
" how can canada think that was the right course of EMOPOSITIVE ? of course we are no better with how we treated the native americans . these poor kids are ripped from their homes and EMONEGATIVESADNESS to such EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS because of who they are . it is sickening . it is as if we have no EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST for the past . who cares if they did n't speak the language or assimilate into " " normal EMOPOSITIVE " " . is that any EMOPOSITIVE to destroy their lives ? no EMOPOSITIVE could ever fix what was done . so many children died , just because they were born into the " " EMONEGATIVE " " EMOPOSITIVE . this mentality , unfortunately , is n't EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS or gone from planet . we are EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS the identity of people who for the most part probably just wanted to live and EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS without interfering with the " " new " " EMOPOSITIVE . is it so EMONEGATIVE to be different ? "
i just recently read an article about the EMONEGATIVE out in the west . i had heard about the EMONEGATIVE of water EMOPOSITIVE in california but i had n't heard anything at all about the EMODISGUSTFEARNEGATIVESADNESS in nevada also . it seems that lots of nevadian , especially the native americans who own EMOPOSITIVE there are in trouble from the EMONEGATIVE of water . with everything dying , it is EMOFEAR for them to keep animals EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST . is it also causing problems in families . who would think that EMONEGATIVE of water would be the cause of EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS , abuse , and EMONEGATIVE . such a sad article .
it disgusts me that this EMONEGATIVE occurred , there should have been a better contingency EMOANTICIPATION to stop all of those gallons oil from spilling . i feel so bad for the environment and the animals who well be negatively affected by this spill . i feel EMOFEARPOSITIVE for the people who rely on the oil , and now have to EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST EMONEGATIVE prices and search for gas .
it EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST of worries me a little bit because sometimes i go through phases where i have a really hard EMOANTICIPATION EMONEGATIVESADNESS asleep or staying asleep . it 's so EMODISGUSTNEGATIVE . it happens or no EMOPOSITIVE and it last 's for like 2 weeks and then all of a EMOSURPRISE stops and does n't EMOANTICIPATION again for awhile . sometimes i 'm so EMONEGATIVE and i really want to EMONEGATIVESADNESS asleep but i just ca n't . i try everything , melanin , warm milk , an eye mask and a fan or EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST EMONEGATIVE but nothing works and then all of a EMOSURPRISE i 'm fine again and no problems .
i really feel bad for the yemeni people . they were already EMONEGATIVESADNESS enough before this EMOPOSITIVE EMOFEARSADNESS . now it has gotten EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS and too many people are dying . i really pray that there is some order and that EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST comes to this country . i feel for the family members of the the EMODISGUSTNEGATIVESADNESS , wounded , and dead .
i think it is EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVESURPRISE to EMOPOSITIVE about new ways to EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST money in my day to day life . i am thrilled to EMOPOSITIVE that there is a potentially far more cost EMOPOSITIVETRUST way for me to live each day , which will put me on my way towards making my dreams come EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST . i am intrigued by the service and i ca n’t EMOANTICIPATIONNEGATIVE to sink my teeth into something that could be of great service down the road .
hello andrea i know it 's only been 2 weeks since you went to japan but i hope it 's good for you and that especially be very EMOPOSITIVE remember that it 's a different country with a different ethnicity things are very different there i hope you take care of everything since there 's a lot of EMODISGUSTNEGATIVESADNESS away from the evils and you 'll be a good EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST until later
it 's EMONEGATIVESADNESS what happened . if i was a politician i 'd say my heart and prayers go out to the victims affected , but honestly ? it 's hard to feel much EMOPOSITIVESADNESS for people so far away . i find the governments efforts to house and EMOPOSITIVE the affected civilians EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST . we have federal agencies devoted to disaster EMOPOSITIVE in the us , but we only go so far in helping people .
wow , what an amazing story . i had no idea that the erika EMONEGATIVE could cause such horrific developmental problems in children . as a parent of 2 myself , nothing scares me more than to think about all the EMOANGERDISGUSTFEARNEGATIVE things that could EMOANTICIPATION to my kids in this world , and what i would do to EMOFEAR them from having to EMOPOSITIVE such things . what a terrible disease , and one that we know so little about and have essentially no EMOPOSITIVETRUST medicine type treatment for ! i 'm sure it 's only a matter of EMOANTICIPATION before this makes it 's way closer to where i live ! scary !
hey . have u heard about the EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESSSURPRISE where a fuel tank exploded and around 75 people where burned to death and many more are EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS . what a world we live in where people for some profit put their life in EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS as well as other . this make me EMODISGUSTNEGATIVESADNESS to my EMOPOSITIVE . who going to take responsibility for all that life EMONEGATIVESADNESS and EMONEGATIVE
i do n't know who leon russell is , but maybe you do ? apparently he passed away in his sleep . i have n't heard of the guy , but he sounded like quite the musician . anyways , he passed away at 74 years old , which is a EMOANTICIPATION life . the article i read stated he had some health issues , unfortunately . poor guy . i hope he passed peacefully .
these poor people in syria . on the lookout all the EMOANTICIPATION , every EMOANTICIPATION you hear a bang or a EMONEGATIVE they must shake . this is so bad these poor people were just going to EMOTRUST . the place you should feel EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST . your trying to make yourself better to EMOPOSITIVE something . if russia targeted this EMOTRUST then i hope they get what they deserve . they should think about their families when carrying out an EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVE such as this .
i just font have many feeling about this article . i EMOSURPRISE i feel bad for the teachers but it does n't exactly EMONEGATIVE me . i am not too EMOFEARSADNESS with affairs in other countries unless it is about EMOFEARNEGATIVE or EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST and political things . packing up and having to move your live away in just a few days is very hard and i EMOSURPRISE i feel some EMOPOSITIVESADNESS about that .
i just read about all kinds of rioting going on in ethiopia . it 's really a EMODISGUSTFEARNEGATIVESADNESS what is going on over there . this is an area which has hopes of dramatic infrastructure EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST and new jobs . many people and organizations have invested a lot of money and now have to wonder whether they should EMOANTICIPATIONPOSITIVETRUST to invest in an area which may be EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS by rioters . it 's so sad to hear about these EMOJOYPOSITIVE farms and nurseries just being gutted and EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS . the farms now have all these workers and equipment with nothing to do . the farms are gone . it sounded as if some of the EMOPOSITIVETRUST in the EMOPOSITIVE tried to EMOPOSITIVE things down , and it worked in some areas , but other areas just raged on with riots and EMOANGERNEGATIVE . ca n't these people see that they are ruining their own future ?
california has problems similar to flint michigan when it comes to EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST water to everyone . while california passed EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST water acts to EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST this , it has had trouble EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST for the poor in unincorporated areas such as bethany EMOFEAR ( tip ? ) . but california has recognized that having access to EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST water is a right for all people . currently they are EMOPOSITIVE on having a nearby city help EMOPOSITIVETRUST EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST water to the bethany EMOFEAR citizens . it really makes one wonder about all the EMOANGERDISGUSTNEGATIVESADNESS already done , the health problems , the children , and it makes one wonder how many other places and other states need to have this resolved .
after EMOPOSITIVE how so many people think EMOSURPRISE will EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS this country i think its EMOPOSITIVE to say some of our most beloved presidents acted the same why yet we keep them up on pedestals . today with social media we just see the problems more out in front since nothing is private anymore . i 'm EMOSADNESS 63 as you know and my mom and granny EMOTRUST me how to behave . do n't go into a room with some man you do n't know . if he tries something tell someone . all these ladies who kept EMOPOSITIVESADNESS or were paid off in some way are just as big a part of the EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS as any man who abuses them . ladies EMOANTICIPATION for us to take EMOPOSITIVETRUST for what happens .
we need to make sure these brave people have more EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST . EMOFEARNEGATIVE needs to realize the value of animal tourism and do more to stop poaching . once these EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVESURPRISE animals are gone , there will be no bringing them back . we need to do more to make sure this does not EMOANTICIPATION . poaching is a huge EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS in africa and penalties need to be severe
check out this article . i wonder someday when all of these theoretic articles will EMOFEAR how things are done ? should we be doing massive changes in the way our EMOFEARNEGATIVE works , the way people are allowed to function ? the products we are able to buy and the activities we are allowed to EMOPOSITIVETRUST in ? will private jets EMOFEAR ?
" i just heard that the editor of ellie magazine killed herself . it is always sad when someone take their own life . what makes this one EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS than the EMOPOSITIVETRUST is that there were chances that she could have been helped but she was turned away . they said that she was " " over the worst of it " " but other evidence suggests that she was not . to me it seems like people did not want to deal with her for some EMOPOSITIVE or they were on a EMONEGATIVE EMOTRUST and could not EMOPOSITIVE to treat her so they turned her away . very sad and very messed up that you turn away someone whop wants helps db they then EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS themselves . the EMOTRUST needs to be EMOTRUST . "
" apparently there are now a lot of wildfires in the appalachia area , and it seems people are going to try to spin this into a " " climate EMOFEAR " " story . it seems that every single EMONEGATIVESADNESS event can be attributed to climate EMOFEAR . the media does n't even try to make an EMOANGERNEGATIVE , it just inserts insinuations . i used to believe that global warming was a deadly EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVE to EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST , but if you look into things , there are many extremely EMOFEARNEGATIVETRUST elements to the " " EMOTRUST " " story , and now i do n't know what to think . even if the EMOTRUST story is EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST , it is EMOPOSITIVETRUST that the issue is being routinely used for political purposes . and i do n't know if it is EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST . why has a vast swath of temperature readings been " " corrected " " ? most people do n't even know about this issue . "
hey have you heard about the polar bears ? this global warming thing is going to take over there home EMOPOSITIVE so fast . they will not be able to out EMOANTICIPATIONFEARJOYPOSITIVE the things that will b more of a EMOSURPRISE at getting them because of what s happening right now . we have to help EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST the polar bears . its been EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST terrible how the EMOFEARNEGATIVE and companies just font care to help EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST these animals .
the eldest generation of russians are n't being treated properly and should have some sort of financial compensation . they are living off very little per day financially and live in poor conditions . after paying utilities , they barely have enough for EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST . health care has also taken a turn for the EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS because they ca n't EMOPOSITIVE to get EMOPOSITIVE health treatment due to the costs involved
so , i just read an article that i have absolutely no EMOPOSITIVE in . it was a bunch of EMONEGATIVE about val wilmer 's health , as if that is newsworthy . i 'm not even sure why i read the whole thing . i gained nothing in the way of EMOPOSITIVE by EMOPOSITIVE this article . what a EMODISGUSTNEGATIVE of EMOANTICIPATION ! people really should EMOPOSITIVE how to mind their own business .
i can not believe that their is still such hate in the world . when i read stories like this i think about how we really need to come together and rid the world of such hate . all those times we talked about things like this happening all over the world really make you think about your own life and what we are doing to make a EMOFEAR / positive impact on the world . i think it is very sad to see lives EMOANGERDISGUSTNEGATIVE in this manner such as careless deaths that will get no one anywhere . i know that you have told me a lot of the same things , so i wanted to see how you felt about this too .
i feel bad for the teachers but there are so many teachers in this country that i would like to see expelled . it is amazing how much power turkey has . i do not really understand this power but it must be EMOFEAR to pack up your life so quickly . i ca n't imagine having to do that . how does anyone EMOANTICIPATION fresh when they were expelled . you would always feel like it is going to EMOANTICIPATION again .
how terrible it would be to live your life EMOPOSITIVE you murdered someone . it would be EMOPOSITIVE to speak to somebody , who was maybe sixty or seventy , and had murdered someone as a EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVESURPRISE person , what they would have to say about it , how they feel about it and what they 've learned , having killed someone , about themselves and society .
the article about sleep disorders really hits home , because i know more than one person who would be diagnosed with a sleep EMOFEARNEGATIVE . all of these people just EMOANTICIPATION to be overnight workers , too . the EMOTRUST that the EMONEGATIVE of sleep and quality sleep can EMOPOSITIVE to a higher EMOANTICIPATIONFEARNEGATIVE of EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS is very EMOFEARNEGATIVESURPRISE . so many people need to EMOANTICIPATION help for sleep disorders , because where the EMOFEARNEGATIVE itself may not cause EMOPOSITIVE health issues , it can EMOPOSITIVE to EMOPOSITIVE health issues .
i just read an article about cave divers in florida who died trying to EMOANTICIPATION the cave EMOTRUST . it seems like an incredibly EMOFEARNEGATIVE thing to do . i 'm not so sure i see the EMOPOSITIVE in doing this EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST of activity . i feel like they people knew the risks and what could EMOANTICIPATION if things go EMONEGATIVE . this is not something i 'd do myself .
wells fargo has seem to EMOANGERNEGATIVE an all EMOANTICIPATION low is the company satisfaction and EMOANGERPOSITIVETRUST . the super EMOFEAR EMOTRUST seems like it does not care about the well being of its employees mental health . mental health in the work place is very EMOPOSITIVETRUST for a EMOANTICIPATION and EMOPOSITIVE life . it seem like this EMOTRUST does n't even care . employees have EMOPOSITIVE that there have been EMOANTICIPATION of EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS and EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS themselves as a EMOANTICIPATION or the work load .
EMOPOSITIVE an article that is basically on the EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVE and EMOANTICIPATIONFEARNEGATIVE of the erika EMONEGATIVE and how it is currently an issue . it does n't affect my felling at all . it is clearly and issue but they 'll make a EMOPOSITIVE for those who do n't become immune by way of their own EMOTRUST , then the EMONEGATIVE will become EMOFEARNEGATIVE to the vaccinations and it will be a never ending up and down cycle that we see all the EMOANTICIPATION . i simply just ca n't let something like this , despite the EMOANTICIPATIONFEARNEGATIVE , affect my feelings and emotions .
this is terrible and really solidifies everything i feel about the racially tense issues going on in america right now that are just fueled by our current EMOPOSITIVETRUST . no one should ever have to be a EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS of a senseless act only because of the type of person they are . we are all equal no matter our EMOTRUST race anything . we need to really open our eyes up and realize there needs to be more EMOJOYPOSITIVE in the world .
i 'm not sure what can be done but global warming is affecting us in many other areas then the ones we have seen and heard . did you know our coffee crops are in EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS of being wiped out ? that 's right , i just read this article detailing the struggles currently going on with coffee crop farmers . there is an intense EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS at the moment for them to maintain their crops and to keep them going . the warm temperatures have really threw a EMONEGATIVE into their day to day operations and maintaining the coffee crops has become quite a EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVE . we are in EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS of either paying really high prices on coffee or EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS scenario being without coffee period . this is very EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVE for me . can you imagine not having our cup of coffee EMOANTICIPATION to get us through the days ? this is truly EMONEGATIVE .
this was an EMOPOSITIVE article . i am a EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST of capital EMOANGERDISGUSTFEARNEGATIVE , yet i find EMODISGUSTFEARNEGATIVESADNESS EMOFEAR to be absolutely EMOANGERDISGUSTNEGATIVE . it costs an EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVE amount of money just to execute somebody with this method , when a few bullets for less than a couple dollars would do the EMOPOSITIVE just as well if not better .
its EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVE and these people are still finding hard to donate blood to the victims despite the EMONEGATIVE rules regarding blood donations . the odds of hiv EMOFEARNEGATIVE are so low that these blood EMOPOSITIVE laws need to be rolled back , like in argentina . in the short term though , a way to help would be organizing a blood drive so those victims will get all the blood they need .
i like lena EMONEGATIVE , and , even though she plays one of the worst mother 's on television , i can imagine that she must be a ball of nerves over this EMOTRUST EMOANGERNEGATIVE . i can;t imagine having to go through this , especially since the EMOTRUST seemed to be EMOPOSITIVETRUST upon . her ex husband does n't seem to be thinking about wylie 's best EMOPOSITIVE - only his own . if it were me , i 'd EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVE tooth and nail to keep my son in the same country as me .
it is sad that people have nothing better to do than to get into other people 's business . it seems that we are at an all EMOANTICIPATION low as a society and that there is no EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST for other people 's privacy . this is what i see as the darker side of the internet . it opens the the door for behavior that should not be encouraged in for a EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST and EMOPOSITIVE society .
i had no idea that caffeine powder could cause problems like that ! other than the obviousness of it being caffeine , i wonder if it 's any EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS than coffee in that way , or if it 's just because its usually a EMONEGATIVE product . also comforter , i have definitely taken in things before , it 's been in menstrual supplements , i did n't know that . i feel like i 've seen EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST tea powder in something as well .
EMOPOSITIVE how you EMOJOYPOSITIVE animals , i EMOANTICIPATION you would like to read about the four paws EMONEGATIVE of the surviving animals in a gaza EMONEGATIVESADNESS zoo . first of all , the zoo was horrid . less than 20 animals remained of the hundreds that had been previously housed here . the rescue of the animals occurred under rather EMOFEARNEGATIVE conditions with haas and israeli forces launching misses during the EMONEGATIVE process . it sounds as though the surviving animals will end up in different locations that deal with their specific species . they will be rehabilitated and may eventually be released back into the EMONEGATIVESURPRISE . let me know what you think .
wow , this is terrible ! i know a lot of you use l'oreal products . you should read this . it has to do with a woman getting awful burns from using their products . she 's going to EMOANGERNEGATIVESADNESS the company . i think we should support her . no company should get away with this . it 's a EMOANGERDISGUSTFEARNEGATIVE reaction and it 's just plain terrible what she has to go through .
i read an article about the gender EMONEGATIVE in the world today . EMONEGATIVESADNESS the us has moved down in the list behind all of the EMOPOSITIVE european countries . i EMOSURPRISE the number of women EMOPOSITIVE in senior positions is shrinking . there is also a EMONEGATIVE of women in the labor EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVE . but there is evidence that the education gender EMONEGATIVE is shrinking , so there are more women EMOPOSITIVE . it just seems that more women are choosing not to work .
i think it 's EMONEGATIVESADNESS that people are targeting children to EMOPOSITIVE their terrorist communities . it 's sad because all these kids have a future but they get wrapped up in this brainwashing stuff . and then people are perfectly fine pinning it on an entire EMOPOSITIVE and that 's not EMOPOSITIVE because it really had nothing to do with the EMOPOSITIVE itself and was more of an individuals decision
the EMOTRUST that human beings are abusing the planet and each other is EMOPOSITIVETRUST in this article . it is enough to get you EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS , read this so you can get an idea of how EMODISGUSTNEGATIVE affects third world countries . instead of going after industries ( probably all american ) with fines , they rather close schools because of the EMODISGUSTNEGATIVE and smog . their health is being affected and not only that , the environment is being EMOPOSITIVE abused .
hey my bf joan , how have you been i read this EMOPOSITIVE article and man i feel EMODISGUSTNEGATIVE living in a country like i do now . all these issues and money being EMOANGERDISGUSTNEGATIVE for what ? i really feel like we as people and a EMOTRUST can do much better then this . i hope we can evolve to become better people in this world .
i just read the most disturbing article about terry jones -- that actor who used to be on monty python . apparently he has a relatively serious form of EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS known as EMOPOSITIVE EMOPOSITIVE aphasia which affects the EMOPOSITIVE to speak , recall EMOANGERNEGATIVE , and generally be able to EMOPOSITIVETRUST with people . so EMOSADNESS sad . i ca n't even imagine how his family must feel . it would be terrible to EMOANTICIPATIONFEAR someone you EMOJOYPOSITIVE slowly EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS like that , .
" that EMODISGUSTNEGATIVE deserves a lot EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS but hopefully we can EMOFEARNEGATIVE all symbols of his EMOPOSITIVE soon . starting with everything he did as EMOPOSITIVETRUST , but then get rid of all his buildings and everything else with his name on it . maybe when he pays for his crimes he will have to sell all those buildings off . it would be great to get a EMOPOSITIVE accounting of everything he actually owns so that he can repay everyone he has ever ripped off over his lifetime of scamming people . the name " " EMOSURPRISE " " should forever be associated with EMOANGERNEGATIVE , gifting , treason , EMOANGERDISGUSTNEGATIVE , cheating and just generally being a piece of human EMODISGUSTNEGATIVE . let his EMONEGATIVE kids live with that brand . "
the indonesian EMOFEARNEGATIVE is not doing enough to EMOPOSITIVE some forest EMOPOSITIVE . the orangutans who number seven fifty to seventeen fifty will be EMOPOSITIVE wiped out if the company that is clearing this EMOPOSITIVE is allowed to EMOANTICIPATIONPOSITIVETRUST . what can we do to form a protest or let the EMOFEARNEGATIVE know that this is not right . can you help me with some ideas ? maybe we email the indonesian EMOFEARNEGATIVE first or EMOANTICIPATION to call them . after that maybe we can EMOANTICIPATION to EMOANGERANTICIPATIONFEARNEGATIVE or have a demonstration at the capitol EMOPOSITIVE voicing our concerns . do you feel the same about this that i do ? if you font i will get someone else to help me or i will go it alone . i just feel so EMOPOSITIVE that something EMOPOSITIVE needs to be done and fast . if we drag our feet they will have this EMOPOSITIVE cleared before we can blink an eye .
it seem like we have enters the day where people are more sensitive to political issues that ever before . although people may not EMOPOSITIVE with the current administration under EMOSURPRISE they can not flat or EMOANGERDISGUSTNEGATIVE other for their EMOTRUST beliefs . it is especially a EMODISGUSTFEARNEGATIVESADNESS when a mom will EMOANGERNEGATIVE out their own EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVE for mock voting is a manner that she find unfitting .
i think that these types of EMONEGATIVE accidents are far and few . i might be EMONEGATIVE , though i do n't hear of too many of them . i think that they may need to reevaluate some of their EMOTRUST techniques to try and make this even more uncommon . it must of really devastated the family and friends of those who EMONEGATIVESADNESS their lives .
just read an article about a celebrity 's parents divorcing , which definitely sucks , since that 's always been something i 've feared would EMOANTICIPATION with my parents . i do n't think the EMOPOSITIVE of the article understands the emotional weight of the situation , though , since they only seem to care about the EMOTRUST that the dad that filed for divorce is good looking .
i really did n't know leonard cohen that much growing up , only listen to a couple of his songs , was n't a big fan but it 's EMONEGATIVE that he died , to be EMOPOSITIVE its a good way to EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS at an old age and died while asleep , painless and nothing that hurts him . he also said that he was EMOANTICIPATION to EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS , so lets take that in for an EMOTRUST , that he was EMOANTICIPATIONPOSITIVETRUST to go . so he died peaceful .
you should read this article on climate EMOFEAR . it 's incredibly EMOPOSITIVE . climate EMOFEAR is happening and it 's really scary . humans are causing it . it will soon be a EMOPOSITIVE EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS for us all . it affects all life on earth , not just people . biodiversity has been affected and has gone down . temperatures are changing for the EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS . it 's simply awful .
" i feel like the syrian EMOFEARNEGATIVE situation is just EMOPOSITIVE out of control at this point , but what often bothers me more is that people who EMOPOSITIVE obama for both terms had a sort of EMONEGATIVE spot on this issue . when the arab spring happened and then the libyan EMOFEARNEGATIVE and now the syrian EMOFEARNEGATIVE ( et terrace ) there was very little meaningful EMOANGERNEGATIVE to it from the democrat - voting side of the aisle . republican lawmakers just EMONEGATIVE to be EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVE to EMONEGATIVESURPRISE obama , if they even did that . in reality , the whole EMOFEARNEGATIVE EMOPOSITIVE " " removing assad " " and because that EMOANTICIPATIONPOSITIVETRUST was considered so EMOPOSITIVETRUST , now we have the current situation of extreme EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS . i feel like it is hard to convey how EMOPOSITIVETRUST this is . "
i just read an article about a very strong category 5 EMOFEARNEGATIVE , ‘ EMOFEARNEGATIVE meantime ’ , which grew stronger as it swept close to taiwan on wednesday . a category 5 has intense EMOPOSITIVE winds of 230 miles per hour , and is being called the strongest EMOANGERNEGATIVE of the year . there were no deaths reported but a handful of injuries and of course EMOPOSITIVE is out for large EMOPOSITIVE of residents . the EMOANGERNEGATIVE may intensify as it heads toward china and is being monitored . what a EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS could EMOANTICIPATIONPOSITIVE if it makes a direct EMOANGERNEGATIVE on some of the highly populated areas in china . could end up being one of the strongest storms of the century .
i just read the most terrible article about EMOFEARNEGATIVE and terrorism , i could n't even imagine the EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVE these people are living . they are being EMOFEARNEGATIVE from their homes by threats of death . the conditions in this area are terrible . they 're low on most EMOPOSITIVE EMOPOSITIVE EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST . so prices for everything are EMONEGATIVE to prices they ca n't even EMOPOSITIVE . i literally can not imagine at all living in a place like this . there are so many others senseless killings in that area already , i would EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVE for the life of my family and myself !
there are several strange factors surrounding the EMONEGATIVE and EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS event . first , why was there not a sign or EMOANGERANTICIPATIONFEARNEGATIVE tape to block off the EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS elevator ? how was the mother able to walk into it without EMOPOSITIVE that it was EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS ? the other EMOPOSITIVE 's reports about the condition of the elevators in the past are also EMOFEARNEGATIVESURPRISE . why was this EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS not addressed EMOANTICIPATION ago by the landlord ? it should not take such a EMOANGERDISGUSTFEARNEGATIVE event to occur for people to recognize that there is a EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS with the EMOPOSITIVE and the way technicians are doing inspections .
these days , women are winning in sports . there has been so many instances of men prevailing in their sport that it is now EMOANTICIPATION that women do the same . sports have been men 's things for so EMOANTICIPATION and i am EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST to see that there are women joining the ranks of these EMOANTICIPATIONPOSITIVETRUST athletes . i am so EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST of my species and how we have come so far in EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST . i EMOJOYPOSITIVE that there are more even playing grounds now .
we should EMOPOSITIVE our environment from now on . i think a lot of EMONEGATIVESURPRISE animals have been put into EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS because of human beings . people have put too much plastics into the oceans and EMODISGUSTNEGATIVE the living society of EMONEGATIVESURPRISE animals . it was EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS to them if there is plastic around . i wish people will do a better jobs .
hello there , i think this situation in haiti needs our EMOPOSITIVE . it 's clear that these people are EMODISGUSTFEARNEGATIVESADNESS after such a catastrophe befell them . i urge you to donate and make a difference in these people 's lives especially the children who are EMODISGUSTFEARNEGATIVESADNESS and do n't have anything to EMOPOSITIVE . every dollar will EMOPOSITIVETRUST i think
there was this little EMODISGUSTNEGATIVE EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST dead down a well somewhere in china . he EMONEGATIVESADNESS down there well helping his EMOTRUST EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVE , i EMOSURPRISE on a EMOANTICIPATION they own . what EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST of EMODISGUSTNEGATIVE is that they were n't able to get him out till four days later ; not really sure why they could n't get him out sooner ... could have saved his life . maybe they just did n't have enough EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST ... sad ... very sad ...
it is really sad the way that people only see one side of the story of the afghan EMOFEARNEGATIVE . we only see things from our side of the pond , and we see the good , but not all of the bad that we do , as a country . we tend to think of things , in generalities , and EMONEGATIVE groups of people who live in a common area , into one pile of terrorists . there are plenty of people in afghanistan who are against eh taliban , and we font see the EMOANGERDISGUSTNEGATIVESADNESS that we are doing by hitting them with EMONEGATIVE strikes . most casualties in wars are civilians , who had nothing to do with the EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS itself . there are always EMONEGATIVE stories about the death tolls . i believe it is used to de - EMOANGERNEGATIVE our fears that , we , as a country , are doing something that could actually turn out to be very harmful instead of EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST
so i think i just read the most EMOPOSITIVE article to date ever published . a girl ran into a EMOFEARPOSITIVETRUST EMOPOSITIVETRUST with her car , while taking a nude topless EMOANGERDISGUSTNEGATIVE to send to her boyfriend . feel a little bad for her , even though she should not be doing this , especially with a glass of wine in her cup holder aha . guessing she was drunk , which is the EMOPOSITIVE EMOANGERNEGATIVE here . she had a bond of 2000 dollars i believe . i EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST of want her to be freed aha .
just read an article that explored EMOSURPRISE 's EMOANTICIPATION and why he won the election . it indicated that EMOSURPRISE had a simple EMOANTICIPATION to the darker side of people , the look out for myself and not others side , it explored EMOSURPRISE 's EMOPOSITIVE to EMOPOSITIVE with those that are EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS and feel left out of society through EMONEGATIVE of jobs , etc . he used this EMOTRUST to promote his agenda , with simple phrases that were easy to remember , and tailored it to the good old EMODISGUSTNEGATIVE EMOANTICIPATION . the article did n't really EMOANTICIPATION russia 's EMONEGATIVEPOSITIVE on the election , only addressed EMOSURPRISE 's EMOANTICIPATION to certain groups .
i do n't understand why we EMOANTICIPATIONPOSITIVETRUST to EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVE this EMOANGERNEGATIVE . people in our EMOFEAR are getting killed . it is not a good sign that anything positive is happening over there . i hate EMOPOSITIVE about EMOFEAR deaths . it is so sad that people have to go out there and EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVE . it seems EMOANGERDISGUSTNEGATIVESADNESS to me that their families at home get to get the phone calls that their EMOJOYPOSITIVE ones have died regardless of the circumstances . we need to do a better EMOPOSITIVE at EMOANGERNEGATIVE batters we actually need to EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVE , vs EMOANGERNEGATIVE the battles of others .
" so i just read another article where a EMOPOSITIVETRUST compared EMOPOSITIVETRUST EMOSURPRISE to adolph hitler . and the EMOPOSITIVETRUST had the EMOPOSITIVE to say that his EMOANTICIPATIONPOSITIVETRUST plans are always " " factually based " " . the last EMOANTICIPATION i checked , donald EMOSURPRISE has not interred 15 million jews to concentration camps where he has killed them . typical EMONEGATIVEPOSITIVE democrat with so much EMONEGATIVE . teachers need to stick to teaching the EMOPOSITIVETRUST and not interjecting their opinions into their lessons . "
the somali EMOPOSITIVE are EMODISGUSTFEARNEGATIVESADNESS greatly . i feel so bad for what they have had to go through over the past while . donald EMOSURPRISE does n't have enough EMOPOSITIVE or EMOPOSITIVETRUST for what they are going through . the EMOPOSITIVETRUST states may EMOPOSITIVE some help , but not nearly enough . they will be in poverty likely their entire lives , and it is just not EMOPOSITIVE . there must be a way to test to see if they are EMOFEARNEGATIVE , and if not they should be EMOJOYPOSITIVE into our country .
now a days for money people are doing anything , EMOTRUST children to make addict of EMODISGUSTNEGATIVE websites and make EMODISGUSTNEGATIVE video from them , i will tell one EMOSURPRISE . the former elementary EMOTRUST volunteer EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVE of EMOPOSITIVE EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVE EMODISGUSTNEGATIVE involving students as EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVESURPRISE as 9 has been indicted on two additional EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST . the guy denote carr away , 23 , of lenard , now faces a total of 15 federal counts of sexual exploitation of a minor to produce EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVE EMODISGUSTNEGATIVE . the federal charges are separate from local charges that carr away faces in EMOPOSITIVE george ’s EMOTRUST , where a local grand EMOTRUST indicted him on 270 counts of EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST crimes and EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVE EMODISGUSTNEGATIVE involving 23 children as EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVESURPRISE as 9 years old .
i just read about arnold palmer dying . he was a EMOPOSITIVE on sunday afternoons watching golf . i really wish that he was still around , i will miss him out on the course . he has always been around since i was a kid , even when he EMONEGATIVE playing he would be out there for the EMOPOSITIVE championships . i think it will be different watching them without him around . he was a genuinely nice man .
i feel bad for the kid that EMONEGATIVESADNESS into the EMONEGATIVE enclosure and chamber , the meme EMOPOSITIVE of 2016 . it sucks that they had to EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVE the EMONEGATIVE , but it did n't know what it was doing to EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS the kid and it seemed like there was no EMOPOSITIVE but to EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS him . it must have been an awful downer for the zoo visitors who EMOANTICIPATION to have a relaxing and EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVE day of leisure . in my opinion the zoo should have given the visitors present at the EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVE a coupon for a future EMOPOSITIVE or something like that to EMOPOSITIVE the downer .
what i have learned from afghanistan is that they are really the source of EMODISGUSTNEGATIVE in the middle east . afghanistan went through bad conditions in the last three decades but in the new EMOFEARNEGATIVE of amid kari from 2000 it 's started developing again many EMOANTICIPATIONPOSITIVE and other works can be seen . it 's going to take a lot of work though .
more trouble at the north dakota pipeline protests ! they have brought in EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVE EMOFEARPOSITIVETRUST who are trying to EMOSURPRISE up the protesters . it looks like they are using rubber bullets and arresting a lot of people . it is scary that we can not peacefully protest in this country without EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVE of EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS or EMONEGATIVE . i hope everyone is okay .
what do you think about guantanamo bay ? should they shut it down or EMOANTICIPATIONPOSITIVETRUST to use it for interrogating supposed terrorist . i do have EMOPOSITIVESADNESS for some of the prisoners who may not particularly be terrorist . from an article i read some of these prisoners or most of them are mentally ill . one thing i learned from this article i read is that some of the psychologists may be assisting with torturing the prisoners . some believe that some of these physicians and psychiatrist should EMOANGERFEAR the EMOANGERNEGATIVE of the EMOANGERDISGUSTNEGATIVE for torture at guantanamo bay .
this article is very tiring . i am EMONEGATIVE of EMOFEARNEGATIVE about the EMODISGUSTNEGATIVE of politicians . there does not seem to be a single good EMOANGERPOSITIVETRUST politician . it would be EMONEGATIVESADNESS to win and position of EMOANTICIPATIONPOSITIVE office without EMODISGUSTNEGATIVE . this is just another example of more EMODISGUSTNEGATIVE . why do the biggest low files decide to be politicians ? maybe because they are the type of people that like to EMOANGERDISGUSTNEGATIVESADNESS and EMOANGERDISGUSTNEGATIVE there way to money and power .
wow .. di you see this ? felicia taylor is suing the makers of this product .. soft sheen carson optimum amy legend no mix , no lye relaxer . she has bald spots , burns , blisters and EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS from using this . do you know anyone who uses this ? if you do have them check out this link . the EMOTRUST suit is for 5 million dollars .. maybe they can get some money .. i think it 's terrible that this product was allowed to be sold . it is awful when someone thinks something would make them look nice but instead ends up damaging them for life . be sure to check the article out .. i think there are some pictures out there too . brace yourself before you look at them .
EMOSURPRISE 's handling of mexico has been EMOANGERDISGUSTNEGATIVE . while illegal immigration may have fallen , it 's no EMOPOSITIVE to treat such a big trading EMOPOSITIVE like a second class world EMOPOSITIVE by telling them they have to EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST for a wall . a wall which would be EMOPOSITIVE EMONEGATIVE as far as keeping people out , because there are such things as shovels and boats . it 's just EMOPOSITIVE EMONEGATIVE .
the previous article says that- countless acts of hate have been carried out since EMOSURPRISE ’s win — day one of donald EMOSURPRISE ’s america came with countless acts of hate that were carried out by his supporters against several of the country ’s most marginalized groups . day two was no different , nor the days following . since election day , there have been more than 200 acts of election - EMOTRUST EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVE and harassment across the u.s. , according to a survey by the southern poverty EMOTRUST EMOPOSITIVETRUST . people from all types of communities ― EMONEGATIVESADNESS , latino , muslim , jewish , asian , queer people , women ― have been physically harmed , slandered with hate EMOPOSITIVE or been the targets of racist graffiti . while we should’t have to live in EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVE for our safety , EMOSURPRISE supporters feel more emboldened than ever to express
" EMOPOSITIVETRUST from an article i just read on the climate talks : " " EMOPOSITIVE region would see changes never EMOPOSITIVETRUST during recorded history . morocco could see increased temperatures and EMONEGATIVE that would drive the southern deserts further north , displacing forests . deserts would expand in the middle east , pushing EMOTRUST forests higher into the mountains . average temperatures in the region have already risen by 1.3 ° c since the EMONEGATIVESADNESS 19ht century , well above the world average of 0.85 ° c , according to the EMOPOSITIVE . " " and we are still arguing over coal as a fuel source so that the billionaires can make more billions . read the EMOPOSITIVE , it 's disturbing what will come to those who EMONEGATIVE through what has been created . "
i really do n't EMOPOSITIVETRUST understand what 's happening in this article . i get that the players need sleep and that 's about it . do you know much about what they 're trying to say here ? i have such little EMOPOSITIVE of sports that i EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS EMOPOSITIVETRUST the lingo associated with the sport . i can understand sleep though !
well well well , look at what we have well , the EMOANGERDISGUSTNEGATIVE kim EMOPOSITIVETRUST finally got what she deserves : being robbed for millions , the EMOANTICIPATION of it is bitter , considering it 's a robbery after all , but think the other way , a rich EMONEGATIVE gal as kim , broadcasting her belongings on social media , i EMOSURPRISE she brought this upon herself
this is a nice little EMOPOSITIVE of american EMOPOSITIVE . i ca nt criticize the entire thing enough . the shallowness of the need for EMONEGATIVE EMOJOYPOSITIVE , the EMONEGATIVE of the EMOPOSITIVETRUST EMOTRUST , the EMOANGERDISGUSTNEGATIVE products of huge corporations playing to the solipsism of american sheep . it 's just another sad piece of EMOANGERDISGUSTNEGATIVE . caloocan , take me away .
after EMOPOSITIVE the article about azania banks and russell crow , i must say it was rather EMODISGUSTNEGATIVE . they treated her really bad . i felt EMOFEARPOSITIVE for her . i tried to put myself into her shoe and i know i would have EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS down and cried . she should have controlled her tongue as well , EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS begot EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS and a soft answer turns away EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVE . russell is not much of a lady 's EMOPOSITIVETRUST he could have dealt with the issue in an EMOJOYPOSITIVE manner . maybe they could just let bygones be bygones and put it behind them . it was rather EMONEGATIVESADNESS .
these people EMOANGERNEGATIVE about who 's EMONEGATIVESADNESS it is , but in the end , we 're just moving down a highway together , that we EMOPOSITIVE together , and all these EMOFEARNEGATIVE curves are our own EMONEGATIVESADNESS . the EMOPOSITIVETRUST to me is , all the republican party did to win was take EMOPOSITIVE of disenfranchised people who are EMONEGATIVE of things that happened ten years ago and beyond , so they looked to the only people who would listen to them , even if they were EMONEGATIVE .
it is very sad to know robert died . he was a great actor . you never now when your EMOANTICIPATION is going to come . i get very EMONEGATIVESADNESS of my own health . there are so many sicknesses and diseases . i tried to get checked annually at the doctors . i hope they come out with a cure for these diseases and sicknesses . i feel like robert did live EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST of a EMOANTICIPATION life . robert has made good memories and i think that is very EMOPOSITIVETRUST when living . i want to make a lot of good memories now that i 'm EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST . everyone life should have meaning just like robert 's .
i think it 's hard to determine things like this unless the entire program in each EMOPOSITIVE is being monitored . if not , the money EMONEGATIVE EMOANGERNEGATIVE the number of children being EMOTRUST or EMOPOSITIVE from this process is hard to determine . i do think that connecting the schools is EMOPOSITIVETRUST though and that children should be EMOPOSITIVE computers , but by the EMOANTICIPATION they 're in the workplace , the jobs may have changed .
we live in a different age where millennial are going to be taking over the EMOPOSITIVE EMOANTICIPATION within this decade . first we elected the first african - american EMOPOSITIVETRUST . now we have EMOSURPRISE , the most EMOANGERNEGATIVE EMOPOSITIVETRUST of all . he may EMOFEAR things for better or for EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS EMOANTICIPATION will tell . hopefully he can bring EMOPOSITIVE .
i can not believe that this happened . i feel so bad for her ! can you believe she EMOPOSITIVE threats on twitter ? it is cuber bullying for sure . i canny imagine this happening to me , how scary ! i am so sad that she had to EMONEGATIVESADNESS her EMOTRUST because of EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS people . ugh ! i hope that these bullies are caught and she can go back to her EMOTRUST .
it 's a EMODISGUSTFEARNEGATIVESADNESS how the EMOFEARNEGATIVE ca n't get this under control . as i 've always said , flint is n't the only city with these problems . the worst part about the localities that EMONEGATIVE the EMOPOSITIVE levels is that either they are fabricating the test results or not being fined at all . i just do n't see that things are going to get any better under pruitt ( he really needs to resign ) . i just ca n't see the epa fining or shutting down water systems that are non EMOPOSITIVE . i am EMOSADNESS EMONEGATIVESADNESS , not only for the children of flint , but for all the children who are still EMONEGATIVE water with high EMOPOSITIVE levels .
it sounds like she was n't cut out to be a EMOFEARTRUST . the way i see it , it was EMOPOSITIVETRUST that the guy was compensating in some way , but he did n't display anything that indicated he was violent - that had to all be in her head . yes , when the cops order you to do something , it 's probably better to comply , especially if they have draw weapons EMOPOSITIVE teasers . no one disputes that his hands were up , and the other EMOPOSITIVETRUST assessed the situation to require a tares , not a EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVE , and apparently , this scenario goes against training , so the EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS was in the EMOPOSITIVETRUST , not the EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS . people wonder why the EMOFEARPOSITIVETRUST are n't trusted , and this is it . they 're human too , and they make mistakes , but their mistakes EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS people unjustly . i feel bad for the family of the EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS and i hope they see EMOPOSITIVETRUST done .
wow that dude has a lot of money ! more power to him , that 's awesome . that guy has worked hard his whole life and built an amazing EMOANTICIPATIONPOSITIVE and he 's unstoppable in the EMONEGATIVE . so yeah what do you guys think ? do you EMOPOSITIVE that he deserves what he 's got ? do you think he really EMONEGATIVESADNESS to EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST for the necklace ? or do you think it 's just EMONEGATIVE news someone made up ?
i am really EMONEGATIVE by this story . the rescue just restored my EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST in EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST . the EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVE of the rescue EMOFEARTRUST proves that EMOPOSITIVE things can be achieved with EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST and EMOPOSITIVETRUST . human EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS causes EMODISGUSTFEARNEGATIVESADNESS to both human beings and animals . EMODISGUSTFEARNEGATIVESADNESS animals should not be EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS or overlooked , even in the midst of human conflicts or natural or man - made disasters . i was very EMONEGATIVE and encouraged by these acts of EMOPOSITIVE and care towards animals .
there has been more EMOANGERNEGATIVE from the saudis in nearby yemen . the EMOPOSITIVETRUST states continues to EMOPOSITIVE the saudis with weapons and EMOFEARJOYPOSITIVETRUST , despite the EMOANGERDISGUSTNEGATIVE use they will be put to . these EMOFEARNEGATIVE crimes seem to be increasingly EMOANTICIPATIONTRUST , yet the us continues to pursue the EMOPOSITIVE dollar in EMOPOSITIVETRUST saudi arabia .
with the ever - growing EMONEGATIVE of EMOANTICIPATIONFEARPOSITIVETRUST clinics and equipment in 3rd world countries , more outbreaks will eventually EMOANTICIPATION and can affect millions of people . this article for example , showed that EMODISGUSTFEARNEGATIVESADNESS outbreak in haiti , millions has been affected and people are dying but we do n't have the EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST to help them .
this article was so sad . i EMOSURPRISE isis had killed many people recently in israel . they were very rude about it and many people were at high EMOANGER EMONEGATIVESADNESS they had bombs or EMONEGATIVE set up as they were recovering and looking for more bodies . they said the people of isis just dumped there bodies as if they were EMODISGUSTNEGATIVESADNESS .
this is so sad . many of you know i use to have a lab . they are often the most sweetest , EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST dogs around . i can not imagine why someone would take out a EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVE and EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVE one . this is another example ( there seem to be countless that EMOANTICIPATION everyday ) of why people should not own guns . i know some people will say it is not a person , but this is still another needless murder that occurred because of a EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVE .
i just EMOANTICIPATION you would want to know my opinion on this . we 've never really talked much about it . i feel like refugees from syria should be given a free shot here in america . we have been over there messing with their country . we have EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST in EMOFEARNEGATIVE , both indirectly and directly . we have been wavering in our responsibilities there . to be able to simply sit back here on our haunches in america judging people who are fleeing for their lives .. definitely partially because of our actions , is EMONEGATIVE . they should be EMOJOYPOSITIVE here . they should n't be treated as terrorists . it is EMOPOSITIVETRUST that poor people who are EMODISGUSTFEARNEGATIVESADNESS should be EMOJOYPOSITIVE here . these are people who would be EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVE to be given a shot , they would work hard . they are family people , hard workers , many of them are talented a

this really sucks for the children and the families affected . they could EMOANGERNEGATIVESADNESS the developers , but no amount of money is going to compensate them for the health issues these kids are going to experience due to EMOPOSITIVE EMODISGUSTNEGATIVE . the worst thing about this is , if it were a wealthy EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST EMOANTICIPATION adjacent to the industrial site they wanted to EMOANGERNEGATIVESADNESS , you know they would have taken every EMOPOSITIVE to test to see if there was any EMOSURPRISE of releasing EMODISGUSTNEGATIVE amounts of EMOPOSITIVE into the vicinity . but it 's a poor EMONEGATIVESADNESS EMOANTICIPATION , so of course they are n't as EMOPOSITIVE .
they should really figure out if these earthquakes are due to racking EMODISGUSTNEGATIVE water , and if so stop the EMOPOSITIVE . politicians earn’t EMOFEARSADNESS about the plight of the ordinary people though . racking companies have lobbyists and money , while the victims of the earthquakes have neither . EMOANTICIPATIONPOSITIVE nothing will get addressed unless something catastrophic happens .
i just read an article on the decision this week to dismiss the kenyan EMOPOSITIVETRUST in charge of the peacekeeping EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVE there . i EMOPOSITIVE that the restoration of a EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST EMOPOSITIVETRUST is EMOPOSITIVETRUST and EMOPOSITIVE in this situation . i hope they can figure it out and the EMOANGERNEGATIVE that is happening all over the country can finally end and they can have EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST .
there are many red squirrels in great britain and are causing EMODISGUSTFEARNEGATIVESADNESS around the city a girl who was near the age EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST in squirrel these have been in scotland and great britannia and even in some cases also in but not eluding them at all - russia . this is a placement and a serious EMOSURPRISE as you can read many people should be EMOFEARSADNESS about this and might turn a line eye to it but something should be done about this and people should try to find a cure of some sort for this
i can understand being EMONEGATIVESADNESS minded and concentrating on other things to the point you 're so EMOPOSITIVETRUST focused you EMONEGATIVE some EMONEGATIVE things around you . but how in the hell do you EMONEGATIVE your kid is in the backseat of the car , much less come back to the car hours later and still not see the kid in there . it makes no EMOPOSITIVE , it 's hard to believe the guy did it on purpose , but it 's hard to believe he did n't remember him twice . really sad and EMONEGATIVE .
just another EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS of EMOFEARPOSITIVETRUST EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVE , not EMOSURPRISE at all this is a massive EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS in our country , usually its the EMONEGATIVESADNESS EMOPOSITIVE on the EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVESURPRISE end of it , but it does effect other people as well . when is this going to stop ? seems like it never is going to end , its been going on since the beginning of EMOTRUST EMONEGATIVE , and will EMOANTICIPATIONPOSITIVETRUST . its EMONEGATIVESADNESS
did you hear about what happened in afghanistan ? there were civilian and EMOFEAR deaths during battles with the taliban . i can not imagine what the afghan family members are going through or what the families of the americans here are going through . it is such a great EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS . this EMOFEARNEGATIVE has got to end soon . i know that the us troops are just trying to help the afghans but there are so many things that go on during these battles . i pray an end comes soon .
there is a lot going on in this one and i had lots of different emotions throughout the whole thing . numerous issues with the article i read , cops EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVE people , people being sent to EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS for far too EMOANTICIPATION of a period of EMOANTICIPATION , as well as militias being formed to EMOPOSITIVE EMOPOSITIVE . i feel our EMOPOSITIVE is EMOPOSITIVETRUST , i feel as though cattle should be able to graze and that we have a huge EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS when it comes to economic issues , due to the way that livestock is taken care of , to produce EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST for people . it is heartbreaking to see people EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVE for EMOPOSITIVE they EMOJOYPOSITIVE it , and it ’s heartbreaking for the EMOFEARPOSITIVETRUST to have to EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVE people over it . people lose years of their lives in EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS over EMOPOSITIVE and cattle and thousands upon thousands of dollars EMOANGERDISGUSTNEGATIVE in EMOANGERANTICIPATIONFEAR cases . the whole article was a EMODISGUSTNEGATIVE !
as it turns out , male models do not make as much as their EMOPOSITIVE counterparts . i was not aware this was the EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS . the reasoning seems to be that male models have a longer EMOANTICIPATIONPOSITIVE , whereas women are considered going downward after thirty . the EMONEGATIVE in EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST between them is quite high . some people are doing their best to EMONEGATIVE the EMOJOYPOSITIVE more EMOPOSITIVETRUST , but it appears to be the EMODISGUSTFEARNEGATIVESADNESS to EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST women more in this industry . i think more men are paying EMOPOSITIVE to their grooming habits . i hope that men will EMOPOSITIVE more EMOPOSITIVE EMOJOYPOSITIVE in the future .
it is very upsetting to hear about a family EMOANGERNEGATIVESADNESS their children in such a freak EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESSSURPRISE way . as a parent myself i can only imagine the EMOANGERDISGUSTFEARNEGATIVE feelings that this family is going through and how everyone must be feeling right now to lose these little girls as such a EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVESURPRISE age . no one should have to EMOSADNESS their own children , it is just terrible .
it is really sad how many millions of people are led EMOFEARNEGATIVE from the EMOPOSITIVETRUST of the bible . when people are EMONEGATIVE to hatred all their lives , it 's very easy for them to become extremists . this EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS EMOFEARSADNESS in pakistan is one of the sickest out there . people with no EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVE of death and who think they 're actually going to be rewarded in the afterlife for EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS EMOPOSITIVETRUST people ? how EMONEGATIVE !
EMOPOSITIVE stuff like this puts the EMOSADNESS in perspective . there has to be something the international EMOPOSITIVE can do that is n't taking in refugees permanently . the vast EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST of these people just want to live and EMOPOSITIVE something for themselves . it is of no EMONEGATIVESADNESS of their own that they were EMONEGATIVESADNESS enough to be born within the fist of a EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVE EMOFEARNEGATIVE .
" hey , man , do n't know if you saw this report on the news , but this article is EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST messed up . those poor people were just trying to have a good EMOANTICIPATION and then all hell EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS lose . i remember seeing the news reports and the images were EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST shocking , but the story in this article takes it to another EMOPOSITIVETRUST . you should read it . these poor people are going to get paid for sure . it is funny how the owner had to EMOANTICIPATION " " god " " trying to EMOPOSITIVE his own EMONEGATIVE . "
seems like so many EMONEGATIVE accidents have been happening lately . i just read another article about the EMONEGATIVE death of a EMOTRUST son that took place during a hike . the both of them EMONEGATIVESADNESS off a EMOFEAR and died recently while exploring the outdoors . there was an EMOANTICIPATION made to recover their bodies but the exact cause was not specified . poor souls . i pray that their family may be given EMOPOSITIVETRUST as they discover the EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS .
this article about people targeting muslims is sickening . one lady 's clothes were set on EMOFEAR ! who does that ? ! another lady was with her 15 month old EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVE and was punched in the face :( it makes me so EMODISGUSTNEGATIVESADNESS that hate going on in today world . i understand that there are terrorists and some are muslims . but that does not mean we should say that every muslim should EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST the price .
the first article never appeared , there was only a generic place holders and nothing to write about . i answered questions about my emotions based on how i feel right now and i 'm writing this to EMOPOSITIVETRUST that the article was n't there . i hope that the following articles will appear and i 'll be able to finish this survey as EMOANTICIPATIONPOSITIVE .
hey , i saw your post about people harming the environment and i definitely EMOPOSITIVE with you . just take a look at this article - it talks about how foods are being EMOANGERDISGUSTNEGATIVE and it can potentially EMOFEARNEGATIVE the environment . since so many people do not care about the environment or do not know the effects of harming the environment , how about you and see set up some program that would help EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST the environment ?
how can they do this to these people ? did you see this ? how can you move people who were fleeing EMOFEARNEGATIVE and EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS to another place after they had already settled there ? it 's EMONEGATIVE , i feel so sorry for these people , and someone needs to step in and help them stay where they are currently comfortable .
hey , here 's another article that i 'm sending to you for no good EMOPOSITIVE , since neither of us are interested in this EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST of thing . it looks like more people died for shitty reasons , but maybe some are still EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST . and , if there 's anything that people EMOJOYPOSITIVE , it 's the idea that things can be ok and / or get better . people fucking EMOJOYPOSITIVE this stuff . but , i did think that the bit about a hen being rescued was out of place . aha . so , what do you think ?
the EMOPOSITIVETRUST of this article i read examined several cases in which youth were killed in EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVE EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS on the same day . they used the EMOTRUST stories of a couple of people to EMOTRUST how the EMOANTICIPATION availability of guns contributes to sad situations in which kids are shot and killed . it was n't as well written as a lot of EMOTRUST in this area , but it was EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST EMOPOSITIVE to hear the stories of the two cases that were detailed . one involved a violent adult who went on a EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVE and shot an ex - girlfriend 's EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVE and another person . the other story involved two kids who were left alone in a home that had a lot of guns and one of them ended up EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVE and EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS the other , claiming it was an EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESSSURPRISE . the EMOPOSITIVETRUST concludes by calling for more active challenges to the nra and the second amendment
it 's so sad to see that world hunger is still such a large issue in other countries , especially when it seems like so much of our EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST goes to EMODISGUSTNEGATIVE . children passing out in the streets simply because they have no EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST to EMOPOSITIVE is heartbreaking . no one should have to EMONEGATIVE simply because they ca n't EMOPOSITIVE EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST . there needs to be another EMOPOSITIVE .
" once again , another group of EMOPOSITIVETRUST people negatively impacted by this buffoon and his horrific policies and his agenda . it still floors me that this immoral EMODISGUSTNEGATIVE is now the EMOPOSITIVETRUST of the EMOPOSITIVETRUST states . i 've EMONEGATIVESADNESS all EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST for our EMOFEARNEGATIVE and the EMOFEARNEGATIVE " " officials " " who run our country . "
it is sad that they can not stop poaching . all wildlife deserves an equal EMOSURPRISE to live EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST on this earth . they should not be hunted down as trophies . i feel EMOJOYPOSITIVE that the security forces are trying to EMOPOSITIVE wildlife . i am also EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST that rhino poaching is a EMOANGERNEGATIVE that will help to EMOPOSITIVE the noncancerous . it hurts to know they hunt the animals just for their horns . that is sheer cruelty , not because they can not EMOPOSITIVE but they do have feelings and should be allowed to live EMONEGATIVESURPRISE and free .
you ca n't sleep too much or too little . what else is new . i 'm sure there will be a high priced drug that can solve this issue . the scientists and EMOFEARNEGATIVE of america could n't care less about the average EMOPOSITIVE . look at the EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST EMOPOSITIVE , look at all of the drugs they want us to take . it 's all about money and has nothing to do with concern for our well - being .
i think that global warming is definitely a very EMOPOSITIVETRUST thing that is occurring today and i feel like it is sad that there are still people who try to EMOANGERNEGATIVE the EMOTRUST that it is a very EMOPOSITIVETRUST thing . sometimes i feel like the people that EMOANGERNEGATIVE with scientists and EMOPOSITIVETRUST evidence that global warming is very EMOPOSITIVETRUST today is just very EMODISGUSTNEGATIVE and live in a bubble where they think that everything is fine in the world and everyone is at EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST . there are so many reasons why we should be using fewer EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST as it is EMOTRUST EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS our environment and it is EMONEGATIVESADNESS that there are people who just EMOANTICIPATIONPOSITIVETRUST to deplete our EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST without a care in the world . maybe the effects wo n't be felt as much in our generation but i am sure that the effects will be felt by those others after us EMONEGATIVESADNESS .
hello EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST , i 'm so EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVE i do n't have a wells fargo EMOTRUST . i 've hated this company for a EMOANTICIPATION EMOANTICIPATION . i 've heard from friends that have an EMOTRUST there that they hated it . it 's not EMOSURPRISE that wells fargo was opening EMONEGATIVE EMOTRUST . imagine the EMONEGATIVE of having to deal with that on your EMOPOSITIVETRUST report . those customers should be compensated big EMOANTICIPATION for this . of course , nobody will be prosecuted .
hey EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST , you should read about the article i just read . the world is just EMOPOSITIVE of problems . i just EMOSADNESS the way some animals EMONEGATIVE in this world especially in EMOFEARNEGATIVE zone areas like gaza , libya syria . i just wish i could do something about it because serious EMOPOSITIVE is needed in those zoos . if only i had powers i could do something about the protection of this animals .
the year 's strongest EMOANGERNEGATIVE sweeps by taiwan — EMOFEARNEGATIVE meantime gathered in EMOPOSITIVETRUST as it swept close to taiwan on wednesday , and with EMOPOSITIVE winds of 230 miles per hour it has been called the strongest EMOANGERNEGATIVE of the year . meantime was classified as category 5 , the highest on the scale . the EMOANGERNEGATIVE has brought not only high winds , but also heavy rain , and many taiwanese cities have flooded . trains and shipping services in some southern cities had stopped , and most flights were EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS . as of wednesday , there were only a few injuries .
" i just read an article about wind turbines EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS birds . i had n't ever EMOANTICIPATION about it before , but it makes a lot of EMOPOSITIVE . it 's just curious that in trying to be " " EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST , " " were actually EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS part of the ecology . apparently , hundreds of thousands of birds are being killed annually . worst of all , they are EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS golden eagles , an EMOFEARNEGATIVE species ! it 's just really sad . "
" though all people who EMOFEARNEGATIVE EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS can be called refugees , EMOSADNESS agencies commonly distinguish between refugees and internally EMOANGERFEARSADNESS persons ( ids ) to decide who is covered by international EMOTRUST and receives EMOPOSITIVE and who does n't . for the most part , little EMOPOSITIVE reaches a person fleeing a EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS until he or she crosses an international border . the EMOPOSITIVETRUST nations high commissioner for refugees ( unhurt ) , EMOJOYPOSITIVE in 1950 , distinguishes refugees and ids this way : " " when a fleeing civilian crosses an international frontier , he or she becomes a EMOSADNESS and as such is EMOPOSITIVE to receive international protection and help . if a person in similar circumstances is EMOANGERFEARSADNESS within his or her home country and becomes an internally EMOANGERFEARSADNESS person , then EMOPOSITIVE and protection "
ugh have you seen what 's going on in new delhi ? the air EMODISGUSTNEGATIVE over there is EMOANGERDISGUSTFEARNEGATIVE and so many people are getting seriously EMODISGUSTNEGATIVESADNESS ! they are calling the city a gas chamber because the air quality is so bad . i 'm so EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVE we do n't have to deal with that around here but i really feel for all of the children who are being affected by all of this . i ca n't imagine how EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS parents feel when there 's nothing they can do to help their kids .
in this EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST , water fears remain year after brazil mine dam disaster — collation , brazil — one year after a dam ruptured and sent a EMOFEAR wave of metal - EMONEGATIVE EMONEGATIVE gushing into one of brazil ’s most EMOPOSITIVETRUST rivers , people who live along the banks wo n’t drink the water and fishermen are EMOFEARNEGATIVE to EMOPOSITIVE their EMOSURPRISE . upward of 10 billion gallons of EMONEGATIVE filled with mining EMODISGUSTNEGATIVE EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS towns in the nov. 5 dam EMOSURPRISE that has been described as the worst environmental disaster in latin america ’s largest country . nineteen people EMONEGATIVESADNESS . across 5,000 acres — about six times the size of new york city ’s central park — the onslaught of EMONEGATIVE crushed thousands of trees and wildlife . in the river , more than 14 tons of fish died , mostly after EMONEGATIVE got stuck in their gills . this EMOPOSITIVE large amount of aquatic .
i just read another article about clashes over in the middle east and i am sending it over to you . this EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST of thing has been going on forever , , , my whole life and i have to admit that i am becoming immune to these types of stories and EMONEGATIVESADNESS all EMOPOSITIVE for these people . normally you would read a story such as this and be heartbroken for the women and children who EMONEGATIVESADNESS their lives but there is a story ( or 2 or 3 or 10 ) like this every day and for decades and no end in sight . so just pile up the bodies of the woman and stack up the children murdered . herd the maimed into a corner and block it all all of your conscious . too much insanity and too much gore to think about so the EMOPOSITIVE thing for you do is just EMONEGATIVE these stories since there will a new one or two or ten EMOANTICIPATION and forever
those poor little babies . this is just going to keep happening more and more . the rate of human caused extinctions is going up at a scary rate . i know pandas and polar bears are EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST of the face of EMOANTICIPATIONPOSITIVETRUST , but they 're not the only EMOPOSITIVE animals out there . and even the ones that are n't cuties matter ! extinction is such a huge , huge deal .
another article i read showing a death of african american driver by a EMOFEARPOSITIVETRUST . i really EMOANGERNEGATIVESADNESS me EMOPOSITIVE this article . that unnecessary EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVE was used to handle the situation . its EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS that the first thing on the EMOFEARPOSITIVETRUST mind is to EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVE to EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS . i feel EMODISGUSTFEARNEGATIVE every EMOANTICIPATION seeing and EMOPOSITIVE about situation like this where a situation could of been handled in a different way . understandable that they work in a high intense environment but that why they train and follow protocol .
it 's EMOPOSITIVE that hughes was EMONEGATIVESADNESS entrance at first - he had claimed that muslim guards worked with the terrorists , but later retracted that and apologized . might have been a bigoted knee EMOANGERSURPRISE reaction . it is nice that these bands came back to EMOPOSITIVETRUST those EMONEGATIVESADNESS in the EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVE . i bet it was very emotional to be there .
hello , i read the article , and i feel like they both have reasons for feeling the way they do , if russel was EMOANGERNEGATIVESADNESS and felt like she was a EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVE he could have called for EMOPOSITIVETRUST or someone from the EMOTRUST to EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS her , he should not have attempted a EMOANGERDISGUSTFEARNEGATIVE EMONEGATIVE . she had to have been EMOANGERNEGATIVESADNESS by russell 's rude comment , and i think that was a hurtful comment regarding her EMOANTICIPATIONPOSITIVE . i do feel bad for her regarding how she was treated .
tigers are truly majestic creatures , and it 's a EMODISGUSTFEARNEGATIVESADNESS that their EMOPOSITIVE are decreasing . india can not EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVE this EMOANGERNEGATIVE on its own . the poachers sell to international buyers , so the governments of other countries should step in and help the indian people EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVE these poachers . there should be a EMONEGATIVESADNESS stigma on using any products made with tiger parts so that people would feel EMODISGUSTNEGATIVESADNESS to EMOPOSITIVE to this sordid EMONEGATIVE EMOTRUST .
hey just wanted to EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST this article with you and let you know some thoughts / feelings about it . i know that we have talked before about the EMOANTICIPATIONPOSITIVE of vaccinations , and if it is EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST for kids to get them . i think this story really made me think about that and brought fourth some really EMOPOSITIVE EMOPOSITIVETRUST and data that make you see how it is changing and EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS different parts of the world . i feel that kids should receive these vaccinations as they are a easy way to help and EMOPOSITIVE people all over the world rather than taking a EMOANTICIPATIONFEARNEGATIVE .
these actresses and actors have tons of money . if they really wanted to do the right thing , they certainly could , for their only son . they are just EMOANGERDISGUSTNEGATIVE people , EMONEGATIVESADNESS what they want and unwilling to compromise with each other . most actors and actresses are like that . they are so self - centered . i ca n’t stand people like that . i feel sorry for the poor kid . although he will probably EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST up to be a self - EMOPOSITIVE , EMOANGERDISGUSTNEGATIVE brat , just like his parents . i EMOPOSITIVETRUST that i think the less people have , the better off they treat their children and their families . i have no EMOPOSITIVESADNESS for people like these rich snobby people . they probably have their own jets , tons of money . yet , they still ca n’t compromise . i wish people like this would get a grip and i wish the media would stop reporting
so many politicians do n't see how serious global warming is and EMONEGATIVE to do anything about it . i 'm not the biggest environmentalist and sometimes i EMONEGATIVE the whole climate EMOFEAR thing , but i do believe it is happening and know that our EMOFEARNEGATIVE needs to do something about it . i have no EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST in our current EMOFEARNEGATIVE to do anything , but i hope others around the world will and we as individuals can do something , even little things . maybe doing things collaboratively can help EMOFEAR things for the better .
can you believe that these women have to EMOPOSITIVE this ? ? i am so EMOJOYPOSITIVE that they are EMOPOSITIVE up for themselves and trying to regain some of their rights . it is EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS that things like this still go on in this world . i stand in support of these brave ladies and i hope that no undue EMOFEARNEGATIVE is caused to them .
i felt sad that the turtles are fading because of the EMOPOSITIVE temperature EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVE annually . we , as humans can help i think by trying to not EMOPOSITIVE to the EMOPOSITIVE of carbon dioxide consumption , we can stop global warming and try to help t he EMOPOSITIVE turtles from going EMONEGATIVESADNESS and so our children and EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST can see them in the future .
it is very EMOFEAR for me to imagine how any person could EMONEGATIVESADNESSSURPRISE a EMOJOYPOSITIVE in a shoe box . i just do n't understand how you could even EMONEGATIVESADNESSSURPRISE a EMOJOYPOSITIVE alone . thank god the EMOJOYPOSITIVE was in good health , at least whoever left the poor thing seems to have taken good care of it other than leaving it in a shoe box . maybe in the end this will turn out to be a good thing for this EMOJOYPOSITIVE , one can only hope .
what a legend , am i right EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST . i have never really got into leonard cohan much but i realize hard work when i see it . this man is a legend in his own rights . books , poetry books while still an undergraduate . this man did it all . did you know he was EMOFEARNEGATIVE to sing really and hated being in front of all the people at first but obviously he got over it eventually . that makes him so repeatable towards me . i feel EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST sympathetic towards the family , they EMONEGATIVESADNESS a great man . i am EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVE he made so much EMOJOYPOSITIVESADNESS cause his stuff will live on forever . hats why i wanted to be a EMOPOSITIVE EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST , to live on after i EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS .
man how sad , that is terrible to imagine what the poor dog went through . i do n't think we should hate the guy too much , even though he should definitely face consequences . EMOANTICIPATIONPOSITIVE i am sure he 's really heart EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS about what happened to the dog , and it was just a EMONEGATIVESADNESS not like some neglectful , hateful act .
hate seems to be increasing in this country . i just read an article that hate crimes are going up . i do n't know what 's going on but people ca n't seem to handle themselves and use EMOPOSITIVE . people are becoming too short - fused and trigger EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST on attacking others with hate crimes . i hope things get better but the article did n't seem too optimistic . i EMOSURPRISE the more we EMOPOSITIVE about this EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST of stuff the better so it does n't get ignored . it 's an EMOPOSITIVETRUST issue .
i think the robbers probably knew that jewelry would be harder to get away with because in order to make money selling it , they could be tracked and EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST out that they were her pieces . it makes more EMOPOSITIVE to EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS money and they probably EMOANTICIPATION she would have a lot considering she is a huge celebrity . they must not have bothered to think that she probably would n't have cash . i feel bad that she went through that .
isis is a group of deeply mentally ill EMOANTICIPATION killers . i simply do n't see them the way i see al - daedalus . now , al - daedalus is also a group of mentally ill people and they 're also EMOANGERDISGUSTFEARNEGATIVE but they 're EMOANGERDISGUSTNEGATIVE serious in their mission . isis feels like a group of guys who EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS just for EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVE . i EMOPOSITIVE with obama on isis being a jv EMOTRUST . i ca n't help but feel terrible for those who have to EMOTRUST the bodies all over mosul . what a EMOANGERDISGUSTFEARNEGATIVE sight that must be . can people EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST once they see that ? do those people have any hope or any way to EMOANTICIPATIONPOSITIVETRUST after they EMOTRUST such atrocities ? what about the children ? i feel so bad for them . it 's so EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS . i wish they would wipe out the middle east and just EMOANTICIPATION over . enough with the political correct bullshit . enough with the religious bullshit .
can you believe they 're doing this ? EMOANGER people out of their homes to expand a EMONEGATIVE EMOANTICIPATION ? screw these guys . what do you think ? personally , i 'm EMOANGERNEGATIVESADNESS and i 'm starting a petition . please sign it if you 're against this issue like i am . it 's absolutely EMOANGERDISGUSTNEGATIVE and should never EMOANTICIPATION , so there you go
i ca nt believe how some countries treat criminals . i EMOPOSITIVE that they should be punished and face consequences but EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS them to death is definitely excessive especially when the EMOANGERNEGATIVE is not that bad . i 'm not sure how that helps the EMOANGERNEGATIVE rates and i definitely font think we should consider that method where we come from .
how to deal with that burning EMOPOSITIVE of what is murder before birth and what is n't ? is it murder because it was against your will ? maybe that is how it should be EMOPOSITIVE if you walk into an EMODISGUSTFEARNEGATIVESADNESS clinic you 're EMOPOSITIVE EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS the fetus EMOANGERNEGATIVE someone EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVE you and your fetus is now unwillingly dead because it was n't your EMOPOSITIVE ?
" it does seem a little disrespectful when someone starts to deface any EMOANTICIPATIONPOSITIVE property . it is a EMOANGERDISGUSTNEGATIVESADNESS and a EMONEGATIVE of EMOANGERPOSITIVETRUST character when something like this happens . no one in their right mind would think of doing this could it could EMOPOSITIVE you in EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS for starters . secondly , you could get sued and in today 's EMOANGERDISGUSTNEGATIVE society you could go EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS rather quick , even with a good EMOANGERDISGUSTFEARNEGATIVE . i EMOSURPRISE that 's why we have laws . not only to EMOPOSITIVE the EMOANTICIPATIONPOSITIVE , whether it be people or " " spaces " " because everyone is supposed to be allowed to EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST the EMOANTICIPATIONPOSITIVE domain . "
i have such EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST feelings for all these poor women that are being raped . american women are freaking out left and right about such minor things when we have these poor women being raped and tortured for no EMOPOSITIVE at all other than who they affiliate with . this stuff is so EMOANGERDISGUSTNEGATIVE and it adds such a EMOANTICIPATIONFEARSURPRISE cloak to it because western journalists are n't really allowed in myanmar . it just seems other wordy that all this EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS and just EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS is going on . not really even that far away , sure it 's the other side of the planet but these crimes and EMOANGERNEGATIVE of human rights is happening one way or another . what would you do in the situation if you were one of the EMOPOSITIVETRUST people stuck in the middle of it ?
this is definitely an upsetting thing that has happened . we like to think that when we go to a theme park , all the rides are EMOPOSITIVE EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST and maintained well . but there is always a EMOANTICIPATIONFEARNEGATIVE , however EMONEGATIVE , that something EMONEGATIVE could EMOANTICIPATION . even in a EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST environment like a well - maintained park , we need to keep up our EMOFEARPOSITIVETRUST and use good EMOSURPRISE .
that kirk guy seems like a EMOPOSITIVETRUST loser . how can you EMOANGERDISGUSTNEGATIVESADNESS about your EMOFEAR history and still get to EMONEGATIVETRUST as a politician . than to EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVE somebody that you do n't even know the EMOPOSITIVETRUST about that person especially when they have made EMODISGUSTFEARNEGATIVESADNESS for their country . so what if somebody was born somewhere else . if they have put their EMOANTICIPATION and heart into a place that place is their home .
we live in a world someone can not only be arrested for their thoughts , but can be seen as a target for EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS from monsters . from the EMOFEAR , to the local EMOFEARNEGATIVE , these actions should be condemned on all fronts . the EMOFEARNEGATIVE was EMONEGATIVE to EMONEGATIVE the EMONEGATIVESADNESS , and the murderer was of course EMONEGATIVE for EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVE him to death . i am saddened that someone EMONEGATIVESADNESS his life because of his charge of a charged message . while i do feel EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVE that apparent EMOPOSITIVETRUST will be served in this EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS , this just goes to EMOTRUST you how violent some people can become when you toss religious ideals into the mix .
there has been uprisings in ethiopia . looks like many people are n't EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST with the industrialization and EMONEGATIVE investments taking place there . people had axes and sounded like a EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST serious event that may EMOANTICIPATIONPOSITIVETRUST . EMONEGATIVE investors are taking notice and may rethink their investments there or in the future . really do n't think of EMONEGATIVE investments in ethiopia but i EMOSURPRISE there is .
this EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST of stuff always makes me EMOFEARNEGATIVE to even go outside . if there is something to EMOSURPRISE someone will just bring it to others and it is just something that is EMOANGERDISGUSTFEARNEGATIVE and not what i would want to put onto others . it makes me EMOFEARNEGATIVE that it could spread and would make things EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS for everyone and drive others to EMOFEARNEGATIVE .
i just read this article about how isis are doing dehumanizing acts upon former EMOTRUST officials . it disgusts me how they do what they do and are not being stopped . i believe that every EMOTRUST in the world should rise up and stand against isis . they should no longer be able to EMOANTICIPATIONPOSITIVETRUST to do what they do on a EMOANTICIPATION basis .
this is messed up . burma ’s EMOFEARNEGATIVE is a EMONEGATIVE . they are so EMONEGATIVE . they basically slaughtered their own citizens . i feel for those EMOANGERFEARSADNESS families . it ’s definitely a scary situation for all those involved . someone should step in and put a stop to this . the EMOPOSITIVETRUST states or un can do something . we should send EMOPOSITIVE .
i wish there was something more that i could do . this is getting out of hand , but it 's EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST of far away geographically from us . there needs to be something the international EMOPOSITIVE can do . farmers everywhere are EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS pests and animals that interfere with their farms , but elephants are EMOPOSITIVE different from pests . they are extremely smart and are just EMOANTICIPATIONNEGATIVE . i honestly wonder if we should come up with a EMOANTICIPATION to feed them , and this might sound EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS , but try to EMOPOSITIVE elephants and come up with some way to EMOPOSITIVETRUST abstract ideas with them .
so , about climate EMOFEAR , i just read an article about it . i have never really been EMOFEARSADNESS about climate EMOFEAR , i think it 's a huge act that is EMONEGATIVE by the EMOFEARNEGATIVE , media , and everyone in between . the EMOPOSITIVETRUST about EMOFEAR increasing are a little scary though ... but i still think climate EMOFEAR is EMONEGATIVE . maybe fires just EMOANTICIPATION more
non - human animals are given rights only because of their interactions with human beings . without EMOANGER with humans , animals do not deserve rights . it is through this interaction with humans that animals are even given EMOANGERPOSITIVETRUST consideration . as the EMOPOSITIVE , animals are becoming even further tarred in society . humans have and are continuing to handle animals as if they are some EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST of material EMOPOSITIVE . this is considered as being immoral , as animals have their own lives , and they think , have feelings , can feel EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS , require EMOJOYPOSITIVE , EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVE , and everything else that humans have . as for human rights , it ’s always uncertain .
the elections nowadays are just so unrelenting . you have to spend a lot of money on campaigns and trying to put down the other person . it 's a wonder that man does n't spend all his money that he has earned . i do n't think he even got a EMOSURPRISE to tell anyone what EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST of person he is . he gets EMONEGATIVE down before he has a EMOSURPRISE to do anything . i 'm just so mad at the whole election EMOTRUST and the way things are done . everything about your past and present gets brought up and nothing you do can go unnoticed .
i feel like there is so many people out there that are less EMOPOSITIVE then us , we need to take a second to see how people feel about themselves and the situations they are in and the people around them . i feel like the person writing this has gone through a lot in his life and this all just adds into the EMOTRUST of everything else
i ca n't believe what i just read . i read this article about how EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVE EMOFEARPOSITIVETRUST took down some pipeline protesters in north dakota . the EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVEPOSITIVE EMOFEARPOSITIVETRUST used such violent and EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVE EMOFEARTRUST to take down the protesters . the protesters were native americans and environmental activists . being environmental activist ourselves could you imagine how we would EMOANGERFEAR to being treated this way . they used sonic devices and rubber bullets EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVE the protesters in the face . i 'm outraged by these actions . this is totally uncalled for and violates several codes of conduct . the cause of the protest was that the pipeline was affecting the local 's water EMOPOSITIVE . i do n't EMOANGERDISGUSTNEGATIVE them for protesting one bit . the actions and the engagement by the EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVE EMOFEARPOSITIVETRUST of north dakota was EMONEGATIVESADNESS and they should be punished .
hello EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST , how have you been lately , i am somewhat EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS by an article that i read recently , that helped me a lot , that i realized that the article had a EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS that interested me more , because of the events that were happening in this , for example : he did not vaccinate or treat his cattle due to EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS ; he does not use cowboys to control them and cope ; does not EMOPOSITIVETRUST or control the reproduction
this is so sad . today i read about a lady who passed away november 6ht and had shared many of her stories of her experiences in the holocaust . it 's very sad to think there are n't many people left to EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST these stories . i remember being in junior high and EMOFEARNEGATIVE someone speak about it , and to think kids these days will never get that . thankfully , there are museums for people to attend to hear and get closer to what truly happened back then .
" a bus driver , going about doing his business , EMOPOSITIVETRUST the EMOPOSITIVE , has had his life taken from him in what is a senseless and needless act . " " taxi driver ague nook helped passengers EMOANTICIPATIONFEARNEGATIVEPOSITIVE . he was in the area meaning to get a haircut and kicked the bus door three times before managing to EMOSURPRISE it open . " " all the people were at the back trying to get out of the bus but they could n't get out the front because of the flames , " " he told the EMOTRUST - EMOANTICIPATION newspaper . " " they could n't open the back door so i kicked it down and they all came running out . " " it was one of the two : you get the people out or they 're going to EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS . " " mr nook said there were three children among the passengers . brisbane lord EMOPOSITIVE graham quirk said it was " " a very , very sad day for the EMOANTICIPATIONPOSITIVETRUST and the wider EMOPOSITIVE " " . flags "
EMOPOSITIVE EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST , i have just read a horrific story EMOANTICIPATION out of hon kong . this man , a wealthy hon kong EMOTRUST , murdered two EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVESURPRISE women in his apartment in a EMODISGUSTNEGATIVE and sadistic fashion . he tortured them repeatedly inside of his EMOJOYPOSITIVE downtown apartment near hon kong 's red light district . he planned to torture them with tools and EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST toys but had to cut it short when one of the women started EMOANGERDISGUSTFEARNEGATIVE loudly in his apartment . he slit her throat and stuffed her body into a suitcase .
i feel EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST indifferent about this EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST of thing overall . it ’s not EMOPOSITIVE to the men , but at the same EMOANTICIPATION society has been conditioned in such a way that we have a higher EMOANGERNEGATIVE for EMOPOSITIVE models and EMONEGATIVESADNESS EMOANGERNEGATIVE for male models . society is EMOANGERDISGUSTNEGATIVESADNESS in a lot of ways , and this is one of the few ways where women EMOPOSITIVE over men .
i was EMOPOSITIVE an article about the erika EMONEGATIVE . it was a EMOPOSITIVETRUST EMOPOSITIVE article that went over what the EMONEGATIVE was and how it affects humans . it 's scary how it can be transmitted through sexual EMOPOSITIVE . i still do n't think i have any serious EMOSURPRISE of contracting the EMONEGATIVE fortunately . those that have are going to have a hard EMOANTICIPATION in life .
environmentalism at its EMOPOSITIVE is a EMONEGATIVE . the leaders will use whatever methods to tie nature together to EMODISGUSTNEGATIVESADNESS you into accepting higher and higher taxes towards cost of living while EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST of this money goes towards these non - profit organizations that help them push their agenda . these environmental groups are only capable of gutting their own people and will not address the larger oil buyers such as china or any other third world EMOTRUST that is burning coal . by raising the cost of oil is n't going to stop saudi arabia or russia from pumping oil , its all a EMONEGATIVE to control the power EMOPOSITIVE and EMONEGATIVESADNESS the people .
the human rights groups are right . it is EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVE . i 'm EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVE we do n't EMOFEARNEGATIVE people like that in our country , but i also feel like this guy in EMOPOSITIVE deserves it . the EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS is that punishments like that end up being applied to people who do n't deserve it too . in this particular EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS , i do n't feel bad for the guy at all . he 's a EMOFEARNEGATIVE .
if people had to see how their EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST was killed , there 's a good EMOSURPRISE they would n't want to EMOPOSITIVE it . between a live EMOFEAR and the package you buy at the grocery EMOANTICIPATIONPOSITIVE lies a world of torture . the inhumane way some of our EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST , particularly EMOFEAR , makes it 's way to our EMOPOSITIVE plate is beyond disturbing . factory farming is simply another EMOPOSITIVETRUST for animal torture .
i think murmansk opinions on the oil import has some EMOPOSITIVE valid points . i feel like his plans and what he wants to do is a good idea . i also feel like their are too many people just trying to make a quick few bucks , they 'll do anything and everything to get there way . i feel bad for some of the less EMOPOSITIVE consumers who have to be tricked into paying these EMOANGERDISGUSTNEGATIVE high prices for oil .
its so EMOPOSITIVETRUST how much lady periods and pills we have to take are linked to our EMONEGATIVESADNESS and body EMONEGATIVE . the chemistry going on in our body is something i ca nt even get hold of . the EMOPOSITIVETRUST though is such a thing we need if we font want to have babies that this EMOANTICIPATION . the after math of it is just a deeper conversation we have to understand so that we font end of EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS yourself .
i can not believe the EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS that has to be . and for god sake , all of them are mostly EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVE , well into the 70 % range . i ca n't believe that at all . seems a bit high but i EMOSURPRISE people just have no EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST for nature or other peoples lives . having your house burn down in a EMONEGATIVESURPRISE EMOFEAR has to be one of the worst things that could EMOANTICIPATION to someone . all your belongings , all those memories , the life you built and the family or friends you surrounded yourself with . gone . well hopefully not your family gone cause then you 'd really be in trouble but your house at least and EMOPOSITIVE things . i hope that never happens to you .
this seems like a EMOFEAR reach , but the EMOANTICIPATIONFEARPOSITIVETRUST exams were either EMOANGERDISGUSTNEGATIVE or the bodies were really never examined . the poles have a EMOPOSITIVE to EMOANGERDISGUSTFEARNEGATIVE russia- russia does itself no favors , no country in the world should EMOTRUST them- , they have a EMOANTICIPATION history of EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS . the EMOPOSITIVE we had EMOPOSITIVE jokes in america a few decades ago started with russian racism towards poles .
i think this is a EMONEGATIVESURPRISE article . i am not sure if there are air EMODISGUSTNEGATIVE problems in sweden . this seems to be like an incomplete EMOPOSITIVE . i would be okay if they took the angle that more densely populated areas are likely to trigger mental health issues because that has somewhat been EMOTRUST in studies in mice . using air EMODISGUSTNEGATIVE as a EMOPOSITIVE for mental health issues is EMODISGUSTNEGATIVE .
whenever you hear about EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS you ca n't help but put yourself in their place and EMOANTICIPATIONFEARNEGATIVESADNESS about how they feel . you wonder about how they EMOANGERFEAR , and how they can believe that a simple EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESSSURPRISE can EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS someone that they EMOJOYPOSITIVE . i am sure that they will second EMOSURPRISE themselves , and wonder how they could let something like that EMOANTICIPATION .
how are you drake i hope you are EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST your new life and your stay in new york , i hope you EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST this new stage of your life now that you are EMOPOSITIVE as a EMOPOSITIVE i hope to see you soon in a big television EMOANTICIPATION or read your articles in the biggest national newspapers i hope it 's good for you , my EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST , see you later and take good care of yourself
it funny how people do EMONEGATIVE things that just EMONEGATIVESURPRISE into their mind like taking a topless EMOANGERDISGUSTNEGATIVE while driving just to send it to the other person . seriously if u want to do that just park the car at the site and do it , it not ur live that u are putting in EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS , it also other pol live that can easily ruined if u font drive EMOPOSITIVE
i just read an article about america 's EMOSADNESS EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS , that talked about the somali EMOPOSITIVE in minneapolis . i ca n't believe the emotional language they tried to use in the article ; it just makes me EMODISGUSTNEGATIVESADNESS to see any reporting that does n't only concern the EMOPOSITIVETRUST , with no editorializing by the EMOPOSITIVETRUST . i wish that everyone who decided to become a EMOPOSITIVE would EMOPOSITIVE that there is no place for opinion in the news .
dude , there is some EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST messed up stuff going on . i feel like every EMOANTICIPATION i turn on the news or open a newspaper i am EMOPOSITIVE about pedophilia going on all over the world . i feel like it is much more common than anyone realizes and that at any given moment , i could be walking past someone who is sexually attracted to children . it is EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS to think about and really scary .
i 'm no parent and i EMOPOSITIVE believe donald EMOSURPRISE is a EMOANGERDISGUSTFEARNEGATIVE man . with that being said , i do n't think it is correct to EMOANGERDISGUSTNEGATIVESADNESS your EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVE from having a different belief as you . children should be able to EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST be able to open up a EMOPOSITIVE with their parents and analyze their opposing views without EMOANTICIPATIONFEARNEGATIVESADNESS if they will receive any type of EMOANGERDISGUSTFEARNEGATIVE . i EMOJOYPOSITIVE jokes and pulling pranks , but to do that to your own EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVE and then to publicly EMONEGATIVESADNESS them ... well that does n't seem funny at all to me . it worries me that the EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVE will from now on tiptoe around certain topics for EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVE of upsetting their parent .
“ the vast EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST of battleground states have republicans overseeing their election systems , ” moore told politico last week . “ it ’s EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST to assume they ’re not rigging the process either against donald EMOSURPRISE or for anyone else . ” meanwhile , EMOSURPRISE ’s downward spiral has EMOFEARNEGATIVE house republicans to scramble to secure their once - EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST and the EMOFEAR balancing act between EMOSURPRISE ’s EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS - hard supporters and EMOPOSITIVE independents has EMOANTICIPATION to take its toll on vulnerable EMOTRUST candidates like new hampshire ’s kelly layette . she trailed by 8 points in a EMOTRUST released on thursday , after polls earlier this month showed a dead heat . for the party that put EMOSURPRISE EMOPOSITIVE , the race has become less of a suspenseful thriller and more , to use a EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST EMOSURPRISE term , of a “ horror EMOTRUST . ”
a nineteen - year - old college student from texas a&m ran into a EMOFEARPOSITIVETRUST car while she was taking a topless photo of herself which she was sending to her boyfriend . the EMOFEARPOSITIVETRUST said she also had an open bottle of wine her the cup holder of her car . she told the EMOFEARPOSITIVETRUST she was taking a photo to send to her boyfriend while she was stopped at a stop light . she was arrested on the EMOFEARNEGATIVE of driving while EMODISGUSTNEGATIVE and then released on a $ 2,000 bond . the EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESSSURPRISE happened about 100 miles north of houston , texas .
its sad and all but when is there every not trouble in the middle east ? you know my EMOPOSITIVE was syrian so this maybe should be more EMOTRUST for me , but its EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST of not . those people are EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS . EMONEGATIVESADNESS sorry for the civilians though and the EMOPOSITIVETRUST states should really take a lot of refugees from there .
funny how it always comes down the to the EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVE and not the person wielding it . people will always be able to get guns , legally or not . the issue is more with society treatment of EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVESURPRISE men . too many single moms , too many kids being ostracized and bullied . but yeah , that 's the EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVE 's EMONEGATIVESADNESS . i do n't own a EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVE , but i 'd be EMONEGATIVE if i gave one up to those EMONEGATIVEPOSITIVE fascists .
i just read this article about a forest EMOPOSITIVE in indonesia that could potentially be cut down and turned in to a tree plant . normally an article like this might not attract my EMOPOSITIVE and cause me to read any further , but this particular forest EMOPOSITIVE is home to the 3rd largest EMOPOSITIVE of EMOFEARNEGATIVE orangutans and if the forest is cut down , it is estimated that 1750 orangutans will EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS or have to be rescued and re - homed . this is so heartbreaking to me because these are EMOPOSITIVETRUST animals , EMOFEARNEGATIVE ones at that , that are just living in their natural environment and have done nothing EMONEGATIVE . how can the EMOFEARNEGATIVE in indonesia think that this idea is even a EMOANTICIPATION , never mind the EMOTRUST it could not possibly be a positive thing because of the EMONEGATIVESADNESS impact it has on this species ! !
those native people really font deserve that EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST of treatment its EMOANGERDISGUSTNEGATIVESADNESS . how can you have people just not speak their own native language ? i font get why they ca nt just let them live in both worlds and experience both cultures instead of forcing them to be a part of their specific EMOPOSITIVE . they really need to be spoken up against for this EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST of EMOANGERNEGATIVE
hello again ! writing to EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST some things i have been EMOPOSITIVE about . i read that syrians and iraqis are EMOPOSITIVE EMOFEARNEGATIVE in germany far more often than pakistanis , and nigerians . germany is confronting the EMOPOSITIVE of deciding who gets to stay . if you ’re from syria or iraq , EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST is almost guaranteed . but if you ’re from nigeria or pakistan , chances are you journeyed all the way there for nothing . this is so EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVE !
why would anyone , let alone a group of 10 - 15 teenagers feel the need to EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVE an EMOPOSITIVETRUST person ? EMONEGATIVE them down and EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS them and than EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS their wallet ? what in the world are these parents doing ? my mother would have killed me herself if she ever EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST out i was treating anyone that way . as far as any by standers that were possible in the area , i truly hope that they came EMOPOSITIVE and these individuals were arrested and detained . they are obviously a EMOFEARNEGATIVE group of kids , who know right from EMONEGATIVE , but for some EMOPOSITIVE , they do n't think the EMOTRUST applies to them .
so theirs this push to EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS your money from banks involved in the pipeline screwing over the sou ix . in thinking about it . EMOANGERNEGATIVE the banks that are EMOANGER the native americans seems like a good way to make a point . all the understand is the EMONEGATIVESADNESS line , and the pipeline company will lose their backers if they begin to lose too much money
i 'm really confused at why multiple articles were mushed together like this . at first i was perturbed at the first article because i felt like the lady was being EMOANGERDISGUSTNEGATIVE . she weighs 500 pounds , so obviously a 1200 calorie diet is going to cause her to lose weight , the EMOTRUST that she ca n't find a scale to EMOANTICIPATIONTRUST her does n't matter . you do n't need a scale to tell you 're EMOANGERNEGATIVESADNESS weight . EMOTRUST your body with measuring tape . but then i got to the article about the mexican students and EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST it really EMODISGUSTFEARNEGATIVESADNESS . i ca n't believe the terrible things people do to one another :(
again it 's all about the money . corporate america strikes again . they EMONEGATIVE as much money from the EMOPOSITIVE class as possible as they sit in their office , finger banging their secretary . when their lies and misdirection is revealed , some EMODISGUSTNEGATIVESADNESS cat takes the EMOANGERDISGUSTNEGATIVE ( along with millions of dollars of EMOPOSITIVE money , and the EMOPOSITIVE class is thrown to the wolves and blamed for most of the misdeeds .
i am not over there , so i do n't EMOPOSITIVETRUST know what 's going on . i do know that we should be helping these poor people out of the water and not letting them EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS from EMOANTICIPATIONNEGATIVESADNESS or whatever else is causing their death , especially not 2 month old babies . this is just EMODISGUSTFEARNEGATIVE that countries can not come to EMOPOSITIVE these people . yes , they know the EMOANTICIPATIONFEARNEGATIVE involved , but because of other countries bombing their EMOPOSITIVE out they are trying to find a better and safer situation for themselves and for their families . i do n't EMOANGERDISGUSTNEGATIVE them trying to better themselves from the EMOFEARNEGATIVE - EMONEGATIVE countries that they come from . i have EMOPOSITIVESADNESS for all of these people .
it is so EMONEGATIVESADNESS that people are being attacked because of their EMOTRUST . a lot of christians in mosul were ordered to EMOPOSITIVE away from their beliefs or EMONEGATIVE heavy consequences . this is not a EMOPOSITIVE most people want to make , let alone be EMOFEARNEGATIVE to EMOFEARNEGATIVE their homes . churches , homes , and streets were not EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST . many people have considered fleeing over returning . however , the human EMOPOSITIVE is strong . we all face EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS . some are brave enough to face the EMOFEARNEGATIVE and harassment they EMOPOSITIVETRUST to rebuild their lives .
this article highlights the EMOTRUST that although we may have profound EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST in the goodness of human nature , we never know when a killer is walking among us . the recent spate of mass shootings at schools and other locations EMOPOSITIVE the EMOPOSITIVE of EMOANGERNEGATIVESADNESS people in our midst . besides EMOPOSITIVE ourselves , we need to ask ourselves what in our society is EMOANGERDISGUSTNEGATIVE this disturbing behavior . certainly the ubiquity and EMOPOSITIVE of EMOANTICIPATIONPOSITIVE guns is one cause , but there may be others that need EMOPOSITIVE as well .
i hate it when these terrorist attacks EMOANTICIPATION on EMOPOSITIVETRUST people who are just living their lives . i do n't know how open societies can EMOPOSITIVE eliminate them ? you ca n't put the terrorist stigma on everyone of a certain EMOTRUST and you ca n't close off your society . there 's always going to be religious zealots and EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS people who feel EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS is the only way to get their ideas across , but we just have to keep EMOANGERNEGATIVE them and trying our best to EMOFEAR an EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVE when possible .
well , there was another EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVE . this one was in washington . there is no EMOPOSITIVETRUST EMOPOSITIVE at this EMOANTICIPATION , but they do n't think it was terrorism . maybe a EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS heart ? anyways , it 's getting EMOANGERDISGUSTNEGATIVE how many people are affected with these mass shootings . just because someone has a EMOANGERNEGATIVE or a mental EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS .
the EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESSSURPRISE burned the field more than 13,300 acres . this is the 75 % of agricultural EMOPOSITIVE . the farmers was very sad about the EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESSSURPRISE . their lands are damaged very highly due to the EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESSSURPRISE . the EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESSSURPRISE EMOFEAR safety EMOTRUST EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST the 25 % of EMOPOSITIVE from the EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESSSURPRISE . this could be very EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST to the farmers . although , they EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS the 75 % agricultural EMOPOSITIVE . even they are did not plant any plants from the burned agricultural EMOPOSITIVE .
well , i font really feel much about this either way . i feel EMONEGATIVESADNESS for the family of the EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS , i 'm sure they are devastated , but it 's not EMOSURPRISE something like this would EMOANTICIPATION , given the type of things he wrote , and the climate in the country in which they lived . my thoughts of out to the family .
i read an article about EMOFEARNEGATIVE meantime . the article said the EMOANGERNEGATIVE passed by taiwan without actually hitting the island , which i suppose was a good thing , because evidently there was another EMOANGERNEGATIVE in 2009 , ty phone moralist , that killed a bunch of people and did billions of dollars of EMOANGERDISGUSTNEGATIVESADNESS . i 'm EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVE i do n't live somewhere where there 's any EMONEGATIVE weather like that , it must be EMOANGERDISGUSTNEGATIVESADNESS to live on an island where it 's EMOANGER and crowded .
" i am sharing this because i wish people can understand what humans are doing to the environment and how its actually affecting our climate . we are going through climate EMOFEAR , and it seems like the world does not care because there 's still EMODISGUSTNEGATIVE and etc . the attic glaciers are melting , waters are getting warmer and people say that 's not " " global warming " " . definitely give this article a read if you are into environmental stuff . "
lockets with blood ? dang , that is EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST of creepy and EMODISGUSTNEGATIVE guys , but oh well , they were in EMOJOYPOSITIVE . people do EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS things when they are in EMOJOYPOSITIVE . now , the EMOTRUST that this guy never felt enough indicates auto EMOJOYPOSITIVESADNESSTRUST issues , she is not god , dude . i still can not believe angelina is over , they were end game to me , but oh well , EMOSURPRISE you can not EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVE things .
why are they prescribing things like that to such EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVESURPRISE kids ? that 's so EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVE . benzodiazepines , especially , should n't be prescribed in EMOPOSITIVETRUST , in my opinion . doctors are overly EMOPOSITIVE about the things they prescribe to people , people that EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVESURPRISE should n't be EMONEGATIVESADNESS to that , and the death tolls are n't EMOSURPRISE .
this is EMONEGATIVE to read about . the sheer number of people dying every day , just trying to EMOANTICIPATIONFEARNEGATIVEPOSITIVE on boats , is quite EMOFEARNEGATIVESURPRISE . think about people from one country equaling those people dying in EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVE EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS in EMOPOSITIVE , EMOANGERNEGATIVE ridden societies - but just for people attempting to EMOANTICIPATIONFEARNEGATIVEPOSITIVE via water . what should we do about this ? open our borders ? is it enough to simply help them get out of where they are to some place safer ? obviously this inst exactly their EMONEGATIVESADNESS , especially the kids . but what can we do ? will money help ? probably not . open borders will . bring them here and help them find a more peaceful way through thrive own lives .
some people are just EMOANGERNEGATIVESADNESS . everyone is going to point to mental EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS in something like this , but i EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVE that when things like this happens , it gets easier and easier just to point at people and call them mentally ill . i EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVE that eventually we are going to get to the point where you can EMOPOSITIVE someone as mentally ill by the crowd . just finger pointing . i feel for these victims and the victims of crimes in the future because we spend too much EMOANTICIPATION making excuses and pointing fingers rather than dealing with the problems at hand .
i did’t know that coconuts are becoming in short EMOPOSITIVE . it was a very EMOPOSITIVE article . i did’t realize how many things are made with coconut or that they have some EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST of EMOTRUST type of thing to keep the seeds . i find it so amazing to EMOPOSITIVE about things i knew nothing about . i EMOJOYPOSITIVE coconuts and did buy some coconut oil but have n’t used it yet . i heard that the oil was good for your skin and hair , although i have n’t tried it yet . EMOPOSITIVE the article made me think about the EMOTRUST “ naked and EMOFEARNEGATIVE ” since the players are often in the EMOFEAR , trying to survivor and finding coconuts on the trees . or on the tv EMOTRUST survivor , where they often EMOPOSITIVE and drink coconut juice . in EMOPOSITIVETRUST , i do n’t know if i have ever eaten a coconut even though i EMOANTICIPATION i did . i EMOPOSITIVE mango , kiwi ’s and oh
i think it is EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS to think that the erika EMONEGATIVE is just going to EMOFEAR . i 'm really EMONEGATIVESADNESS about getting bit by an infected EMOANGERDISGUSTNEGATIVE and then getting pregnant . i would n't want anything to EMOANTICIPATION to my EMOJOYPOSITIVE . this person thinks that we should just put girls in a room with infected EMOANGERDISGUSTNEGATIVE 's and let them get bit . i do n't think you can EMOFEAR immunity that way . i do n't think this EMONEGATIVE is just going to EMOFEAR . i think something has to be done to EMOFEAR it from infecting more people . it needs to be controlled . i think it is sad for those that have already gotten the EMONEGATIVE . something has to be done to help these poor people .
the article i read about the venezuela zoo where the animals EMONEGATIVE due to EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS . the country economical condition go down and rise the prices of EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST . the country ca n't EMOPOSITIVETRUST to import EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST due to bad economical situation . animals on the EMONEGATIVE zoo staffers have been feeding EMOFEARNEGATIVE lions and tigers diets of mango and pumpkin . elephant eats tropical EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST instead of hey .
i just read an article about how billy bob thornton felt about his EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST to angelia josie . he expressed that he did not feel good enough to be with her . this was EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST of EMOSURPRISE . it made me feel emphatic towards him . he stated that he did not like being around rich and EMOPOSITIVETRUST people . this made me feel like he is repeatable . i did find it odd that they both wore vials of blood around their necks while they were together . it was a little EMODISGUSTNEGATIVE . he even went into detail about how they cut their fingers together to get the blood and then compared it the lockets you can buy and put pictures of your grandmas in . i also did not realize that he is 20 years her junior . i EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST that to be a little old but i have seen it work . the article also briefly EMONEGATIVE on her relationship with brad .
this is a EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS story with so many facets to it , om . i mean on one hand , i do n't support an eye for an eye . i do n't support the death EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS and i do n't support blinding someone . but on the other hand , this is a country where women really EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS and the EMOPOSITIVETRUST EMOTRUST is not well developed . also , he EMONEGATIVE a four year old girl . what the fuck is EMONEGATIVE with this guy . so if this was in america i would not support it , but i do n't feel right condemning the actions of an entirely different country for doing what they felt needed to be done .
i just read an article that the u.n. reports that isis has executed over 200 people near the iraqi city of mosul and is using thousands of people as human shields . the iraqi forces are advancing against them and as a EMOANTICIPATION , isis carried out mass killings , EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS people who had defied its orders . they are even forcing women to EMONEGATIVETRUST gloves to EMOPOSITIVE EMOTRUST themselves , and EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVE anyone who has even a cell phone of being a spy . it seems they are growing increasingly EMONEGATIVE and EMOPOSITIVE to take the lives and EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST of everyone in their path without regard to EMOPOSITIVE or even basic EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST . this EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS must be stopped , it is so heartbreaking to read about these victims !
life is a EMOFEARNEGATIVE thing . people are EMODISGUSTFEARNEGATIVESADNESS from natural and man - made disasters . there is a huge number of deaths due to hazing in indonesia . all driven by over - industrialization and hunger of profits . governments and scientists should do more to EMOFEAR these kinds of deaths : at least to have certain EMOFEAR systems installed . also , natural disasters such as hails and typhoons can wreck a EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVE in peoples ’ lives . now i have second thoughts about EMOPOSITIVE to south EMOPOSITIVE islands . they are EMOJOYPOSITIVE but EMOFEARNEGATIVE .
" i think the short of it really is that the racists won the election . it is incredibly sad that such a seemingly easy to win election against someone who is openly calling groups of racist things , and actually encouraging hate and EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS , was EMONEGATIVESADNESS . the democrats are right to be taking a EMOANTICIPATION look at how they do things , they 've always been the party that is " " we 're like the republicans , but you wo n't EMODISGUSTNEGATIVE as much voting for us . " " i think the average person who cares about EMOANGER , and is EMONEGATIVEPOSITIVE , got a shocking wake up call this EMOANTICIPATION around , and we 're going to see people turn out in incredible EMOPOSITIVE to vote . "
this is so sad , but i think it had a lot to do with a bunch of college kids EMONEGATIVE and partying , and then something going EMOSADNESS EMONEGATIVE . i think there was a group of kids that started arguing with the guy and one got EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST riled up and EMOANGERNEGATIVE the guy . i find it EMOPOSITIVE that there were things that were not being commented on . i think there 's a lot more to this story than what the EMOTRUST is reporting .
i could not help but think of my and my son would we be in a similar situation . i know my son is much EMOPOSITIVE and the situation would be very different , but part of me can feel the water as we are swimming to get EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST . i can see myself looking back to be sure that he is still with me , maybe reaching back to try to EMOPOSITIVE him closer . it is a very intense EMOANTICIPATION .
this is such a sad story . i feel so much for the mother trying to get away . sometimes it seems like things wo n't be so bad . sometimes it seems like EMOANTICIPATION is another EMOSURPRISE , but it seems to me that you ca n't give people the EMOANTICIPATIONPOSITIVE to destroy because they will . i would always EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST a one EMOANGERNEGATIVE EMOTRUST for my friends . that reminds me , how was your EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST after her husband threatened to EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVE her - are they still together ?
" i do n't understand how people can look at stories like this and still claim that " " guns do n't EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS people , people EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS people " " . if guns were less available and less EMOTRUST in communities prone to EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS , then confrontations between people would be far less likely to be EMODISGUSTFEARNEGATIVESADNESS . it needs to be more EMOFEAR to obtain a firearm in this country . "
did you see where republicans are trying to stop EMONEGATIVESADNESS people from voting . it 's like its 1800 's again in the u.s. and the rich are using the southern strategy to stop likely democrats from voting , using the divide and conquer strategy of trying to turn the people against each other instead of who they should be against . rich republicans . this is fascism , nazism , and we are going to lose our EMOPOSITIVE if people do n't wake up and get in the streets and EMOANGERNEGATIVE these people be stopped . it 's literally a EMOANGERSURPRISE of our EMOFEARNEGATIVE .
oh , but global warming is n't EMOPOSITIVETRUST , right ? we have all kinds of EMOANTICIPATION to fix the EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS , right ? it 's not humans , it 's natural variation , right ? EMOPOSITIVE EMODISGUSTNEGATIVE are we ever ostriches as a species - are we going to dig our heads out of the sand in EMOANTICIPATION ? EMOFEAR has to EMOANTICIPATION , and it has to EMOANTICIPATION now , we ca n't EMOANTICIPATIONNEGATIVE for all the old EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST men who run things to EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS
did you know that climate EMOFEAR threatens the world ’s coffee EMOPOSITIVE ? ? a report i read about a report says thinking of the many ways climate EMOFEAR threatens coffee and coffee farmers has alarmed people who are now imagining what it would be like getting through the day without their caffeine fix ! well , it certainly is concerning to me ! the report , released this month , was commissioned by EMOPOSITIVE EMOTRUST australia and new zeal and supposedly the hub of the global EMOPOSITIVE EMOTRUST EMOTRUST . i EMOSURPRISE it does’t contain much new research , but still it has made waves by collating an EMOPOSITIVE of available literature suggesting that climate EMOFEAR will have a EMOPOSITIVE effect on the world ’s coffee EMOPOSITIVE . well , EMOPOSITIVE how you EMOJOYPOSITIVE your coffee just as much as i do , i just knew this would fascinate you ! tell everyone ! !
i EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST much hate all wildlife EMOPOSITIVE squirrels . they should just go EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESURPRISE the little varmint . after all squirrels carry EMONEGATIVE and other diseases even if they say EMONEGATIVE animals seldom have EMONEGATIVE . once you EMONEGATIVE a human , it 's over and you deserve to EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS . it is EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST of funny though these elderly people not being able to get away . why does everything wacky always EMOANTICIPATION in florida . like 30 % of anything strange happens in florida . frankly i think some EMOPOSITIVETRUST made the whole thing up . squirrels are not going to EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVE multiple people . sure they might on a rare occasion EMONEGATIVE someone but not three people . then again it 's florida so common laws and logic go out the window . anyhow EMOANTICIPATION you might EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST some EMONEGATIVE on some things i read . take care EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST . later .
i just read an article about a mother and EMOTRUST that sexually abused their EMOJOYPOSITIVE from the age of 11 . it is just EMOANGERDISGUSTFEARNEGATIVE . i ca n't imagine how in the world someone would be okay doing this to their EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVE . those parents deserve a EMOANTICIPATIONNEGATIVE EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS than death . what is EMONEGATIVE with people ? they EMOPOSITIVE to be tortured until the day they EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS . so EMOANGERDISGUSTFEARNEGATIVE .
i think we should just EMONEGATIVESADNESSSURPRISE them where they are . they 're not causing any problems . they 're too EMOFEARNEGATIVE and too costly to try to move . there has n't been great reports of them EMONEGATIVE . they should be fine to roam around there for now . we do n't want to EMODISGUSTNEGATIVE EMONEGATIVESADNESS dollars to try to deal with a EMOFEARNEGATIVE situation .
i have very little EMOPOSITIVESADNESS for turkey , it 's a country that has been playing every sides of the field it can for a EMOANTICIPATION EMOANTICIPATION . it is so EMONEGATIVE , because of this . i feel for the people , and that 's why there are so many EMONEGATIVE groups , not counting outside terrorist groups trying to EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVE EMONEGATIVEPOSITIVE in the area . i feel nothing for the country , only the people .
i was EMOPOSITIVE an article about poachers EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS off many elephants because of the ivory EMOTRUST . one part that stuck in my mind is that in one country , the elephants are EMOTRUST more than they are in the neighboring country . it is odd that an elephant can literally walk away from its protection by wandering into the neighboring country . i was not aware of any of this . the article somewhat jokingly said that elephants do not have passports .
hey , did you read this article ? south korea always seems to have something going on . 26 were hospitalized and 29 were treated at the scene . it seems like more and more often this EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST of thing is happening . there has to be a better way of getting points across without injuries . it 's EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS and really unnecessary to cause EMOFEARNEGATIVE for this .
wow , a EMOPOSITIVETRUST get pregnant after having EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST numerous times with an 8ht grader pleads EMOANGERNEGATIVESADNESS to a EMODISGUSTNEGATIVE charge of EMOANGERNEGATIVE sexual EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVE of a EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVE . this is unreal and aggravates me that teachers would do this and children would go along with it . the world needs to EMOANTICIPATIONFEARNEGATIVESADNESS less about wants , EMONEGATIVE being emotionally and physically weak and EMOPOSITIVE on needs , not wants . this whole story ii EMODISGUSTNEGATIVESADNESS and all involved have ruined their own lives and for what , pleasure ? they 're all weak .
it 's shocking how little people care about this and how little africa gets mentioned in the news . this is horrific when you think about the number of victims and the people who are harmed . i wish people could EMOPOSITIVE on this . it 's EMOANGERDISGUSTNEGATIVE that people are getting away with this and it is a huge EMONEGATIVE on the EMOPOSITIVETRUST of other genocides in history .
friends and family - we need to lobby for EMOPOSITIVETRUST EMOSURPRISE to take global warming more seriously . as predicted , the temperature may rise in the near future by one point five degrees celsius . this will drastically EMOFEAR our weather and therefore cause EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS effects to many , many places around the world . this can all be stopped though if we get on EMOANTICIPATION now !
so EMOSURPRISE 's guy of scouts is anti lente . he 's so far off the mark its EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVE . wants to EMONEGATIVE gay EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST basically . like , who is gon na EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVEPOSITIVE what happens in someones bedroom ? i ca nt with this administration anymore . where will it end ? just let people EMOJOYPOSITIVE who they want ... EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS homophones are gon na make america a whole new version of hell
here is another example of domestic EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVE EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS that is happening in america . i know that you feel very EMOPOSITIVE about this issue and figured that you might want to read this article that i EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST . it is such a sad story , and until we get the guns off the street , these stories are just going to keep EMOANTICIPATION up .
" the EMOTRUST that all EMOSURPRISE has to say when asked about his supporters being violent is " " stop it . " " is EMODISGUSTNEGATIVE . yet when he is asked his opinion on minorities like muslims or hispanics , he can go on for days . him and his supporters have worms in their EMOPOSITIVE or something . there 's no way any EMOPOSITIVE person capable of rationality would EMOPOSITIVE with half the things he says . "
after EMOPOSITIVE that article on the arctic ice , i feel that maybe we should get together and do something . maybe find an organization to donate EMOANTICIPATION and money too . i do n't know , but it is scary that the ice is not rebounding . i am not sure what will EMOANTICIPATION in the future , but if we can try to get people aware now of their carbon footprint , maybe , just maybe we can make a EMONEGATIVE impact on the ice melting . i know the earth goes through cycles , but i am sure that humans have greatly impacted the amount of thawing way more than normal cycles . it is as if humans are a EMODISGUSTFEARNEGATIVE . we are like a EMONEGATIVESADNESS EMONEGATIVE to the earth . it 's getting scary out there and we have no other planet to go to in this vast universe . we ca n't EMODISGUSTNEGATIVE up the one we have .
this article was quite EMOPOSITIVE to me . it talked about the invention of a new male contraceptive . it talks about the potential side effects that steer men away from using the contraceptive . the EMOPOSITIVE of the article mocks men for EMOFEAR these contraceptives when EMOPOSITIVE contraceptives have way more side effects to them . i personally EMOANGERNEGATIVE with the EMOPOSITIVE - if male contraceptives were invented before EMOPOSITIVE contraceptives , i believe that males would have no EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS using them despite the side effects . what are your thoughts ?
since you moved to EMOPOSITIVESADNESS , i ’m sure you’be been aware of all the unsolved homicides that have occurred . just wanted to say “ stay EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST ” . hopefully , that guy that shot at the EMOFEARPOSITIVETRUST EMOPOSITIVETRUST the other day and whose EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVE they say was used in some of those unsolved cases , was the killer . if so , his reign of EMOFEARNEGATIVE is over . how sad that those people died for what appears to be just being in the EMONEGATIVE place at the EMONEGATIVE EMOANTICIPATION . i just do n’t understand how someone can take the life of another unless their own life is being threatened . who knows though ? the killer could be mentally ill and think that EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST strangers are EMOANGERDISGUSTFEARNEGATIVE them ! anyway , keep your eyes open and be EMOPOSITIVE !
this makes me feel nothing . i do n't care about this . i do n't see why i have to care about this . bad things like this EMOANTICIPATION all the EMOANTICIPATION and they have no affect on me . i have too many problems of my own to have to EMOANTICIPATIONFEARNEGATIVESADNESS about more things like this . thinking about this EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST of stuff just adds to my EMONEGATIVE .
it 's a EMODISGUSTFEARNEGATIVESADNESS that we have so many random acts of EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS in this country . it seems every other week we have some massacre involving either guns , a right wing extremist or a muslim extremist . i think what they have in common are either mentally ill people or people who are extremist in their world views and EMOTRUST .
i 'm sorry to hear that about dakota 's parents . even when you are adult it must be hard to see your parents EMONEGATIVESADNESS up . no one wants that to EMOANTICIPATION and it 's EMONEGATIVESADNESS that her parents could n't work it out . i hope they are able to still remain EMOPOSITIVE around the kids and family . just because it did n't work romantically does n't mean it wo n't work at all .
i feel really EMOFEARSADNESS that they have no idea who EMOPOSITIVETRUST this EMOANGERNEGATIVE . i wonder if there 's more to this story . i wonder what the conditions were that led up to this event . i hope the victims will make a EMOPOSITIVE EMOPOSITIVE and that they EMOSURPRISE this EMOANGERDISGUSTFEARNEGATIVE person ! my thoughts are with them and their families !
just another fucked up mental EMODISGUSTFEARNEGATIVESADNESS of american EMOFEARPOSITIVETRUST against its EMONEGATIVESADNESS residents , i honestly have no idea why they have to be so sensitive with their fucking guns , they EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVE people as if people can re spawn after being shot or something , EMOFEARPOSITIVETRUST should think twice before taking out people 's lives with no legitimate EMOPOSITIVE , i EMOSURPRISE it 's good that EMOFEARPOSITIVETRUST have body cam , so the EMOANTICIPATIONPOSITIVE can see what EMODISGUSTFEARNEGATIVESADNESS they are bribing upon themselves
it may make me sound EMOANGERDISGUSTFEARNEGATIVE , but i 'm EMONEGATIVE on this . no one should have to EMONEGATIVE like that for the EMOANGERNEGATIVE of theft , it 's EMOANGERDISGUSTFEARNEGATIVE , but if it really was a twenty - something that was part of an EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVEPOSITIVE EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVE , i 'm slightly less sympathetic about their victims retaliating . if it was a EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVE , however , this is insanity and just EMODISGUSTFEARNEGATIVESADNESS .
there is something very , very EMONEGATIVE with someone who thinks nothing of EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS a EMOPOSITIVETRUST human being . how EMONEGATIVESADNESS someone must also be to take the life of another human no one has the bloody right to take . and how rotten one must be to EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS an EMOPOSITIVETRUST animal that is without sin and any capability of purposely doing EMOFEARNEGATIVE .
i 'm the last one to want to EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS EMOANGERDISGUSTNEGATIVE anyone . i think as a celebrity you have to be a bit more conscious of your actions . do i think kim by posting the pics made someone want to rob her ? no , but i think it 's probably best to be more EMOPOSITIVETRUST about what you post . i mean , just for safeties sake . i EMOPOSITIVE , i 'd be scared to post about tristan 's ring too especially since it was n't so EMOANTICIPATION ago that kim was robbed . yes , i 'm sure everything is insured , but it 's still a scary experience and i 'd do everything i could to EMOFEARNEGATIVE it .
i am one for not EMOPOSITIVE your potential EMOPOSITIVETRUST any reasonable EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESSTRUST . for example if tan aka ( maria carey 's backup dancer ) made her fiance EMONEGATIVE he should have been axed in the beginning of the relationship . i also do not think it supports security all the EMOANTICIPATION either . i think that if you value that EMOPOSITIVETRUST there should definitely be EMODISGUSTFEARNEGATIVESADNESS made in regards with relationships .
EMOFEARNEGATIVE EMOPOSITIVE this article . it 's so fucking EMOANTICIPATION for saying so little . the EMOPOSITIVETRUST feels the need to go on and on about EMONEGATIVE details and it comes off as the ramblings of a skit out on the street corner . it 's the same EMONEGATIVE the media pushes about those poor kids , but does n't delve into how none of this EMOANGERDISGUSTNEGATIVE would have happened if people were EMOPOSITIVETRUST and did n't make EMOANGERDISGUSTNEGATIVE choices that are obviously bad .
" i ca n't believe this article that i just read . they are making these allegations of homophobia and all kinds of EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS notions of hatred against gays , etc . what do they EMOANTICIPATIONPOSITIVESURPRISETRUST people to think when every EMOANTICIPATION we hear of a bombing , it is a muslim . do they EMOANTICIPATIONPOSITIVESURPRISETRUST people to say thank you ? i do n't hear any islamic leaders speaking out against any of the terrorism . are we just to sit back and say " " thank you EMOPOSITIVETRUST , may i have another . " " not only do i not hear any islamic leaders speaking out against it , i do n't hear any muslim citizens speaking out either . as to the gay and transgender stuff , i will speak out against whomever i wish . they have a right to EMODISGUST their immoral acts all of the place , then i have the right to speak out against their immoral acts which are an affront to EMOPOSITIVE god "
why do people EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS harmless animals ? it does n't make EMOPOSITIVE to me honestly . i look into the eyes of an animal and i ca n't help thinking that they do n't EMOPOSITIVETRUST understand why we would EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS them either . i think it 's so cruel that people do this to animals because they EMOTRUST us to keep them EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST it does n't matter if they 're EMONEGATIVESURPRISE or not . this poor elephant that was chained up , and beaten , and made to do tricks just for our EMOJOYPOSITIVE .
this always makes me mad guys , that the cops think they can EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVE because of color . its absolutely EMOANGERDISGUSTNEGATIVE ! of course , the EMOFEARTRUST is n't being charged for murder , and EMODISGUSTFEARNEGATIVE still stands in this country . it is extremely sad that the world has to come to this .. just EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS off anybody because they think they 're above the EMOTRUST .
ugh . that 's rough . i feel so bad for that little girl and she deserves to live in a world where EMOPOSITIVETRUST is made , but that eye - for - an - eye type EMOPOSITIVETRUST is so medieval . the guy obviously deserves a very harsh EMOANGERDISGUSTFEARNEGATIVE , but this is EMOANGERDISGUSTFEARNEGATIVE . this is the difference between revenge and EMOPOSITIVETRUST . a 20 - year EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS sentence makes so much more EMOPOSITIVE than blinding .
i like some of these new approaches to reducing the harmful effects of bullying , but it 's still not enough . just having a shocking video that raises awareness does n't help the EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS from starting , just helps us EMOANGERFEAR to it quicker . we need to keep EMOPOSITIVE programs that are designed to support our children , but we need to do it before they EMOANTICIPATION to EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVE ( or be bullied ) . so many of our anti - bullying stories EMOPOSITIVE about EMOPOSITIVE up to them and bullying back ... that is not the way !
i EMOANTICIPATION this was a EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST EMOPOSITIVE article . i learned some things about EMOJOYPOSITIVESADNESS and lawsuits . it might be EMOPOSITIVETRUST to some of what you and i were talking about some EMOANTICIPATION ago . in any EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS , it has some new EMOPOSITIVETRUST that have come to light , as it were , new EMOPOSITIVE or opinions that i had not EMOPOSITIVETRUST considered prior to EMOPOSITIVE this article .
i tend to be very hard - heated when it comes to issues of immigration . yet this is a man for who all intents and purposes is an american , raised here from the age of three and facing EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS for missed paperwork ? this is quite frankly a steaming pile of bullshit . there are those who come here , infest neighborhoods and take away jobs from hard EMOPOSITIVE americans and then there are victims of bureaucratic EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVE - EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS like this . these types of scenarios are EMONEGATIVESADNESS . i tend to believe that a EMOTRUST that will let the EMOANGERNEGATIVESADNESS go free is preferable to one that will EMOFEARNEGATIVE even one EMOPOSITIVETRUST man . men like this deserve to be treated as americans , because they are .
i ’m EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVE that i do n’t work at well ’s fargo . to think that they would push their employees to the brink of EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS and having mental health issues is totally EMOANGERDISGUSTNEGATIVE . and all in the name of the EMOPOSITIVE dollar . i wish companies cared more for their employees , than their EMONEGATIVESADNESS line . i have worked for a company for over 30 years and in the early years , the company cared about its employees . they treated us like family . the last ten or fifteen years have been so EMOFEAR . they could care less about their loyal employees . they treat us like EMODISGUSTNEGATIVE . all they care about is how much money they can make , never caring about how much EMONEGATIVE they are putting on their workers . there has got to be a better way . i ’m so EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVE i will be retiring in another year or so . i do n’t think i could st
i think timeshares are silly and this article just confirms it . in the article it talks about how hard it is for some people to get rid of timeshares after they have them . timeshare salesmen are so pushy when you first sign up for one i ca n't imagine how hard it is to get out of one . i 'm just EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVE that i do n't have a timeshare and never will . i 'm sure they have some many tiny provisions in their contracts that make them really EMOFEAR to get out of successfully .
i just read an article about EMOSURPRISE protesters that had fireworks shot at them . this story breaks my heart . some of the protesters also were EMODISGUST on and endured racial slurs . i do not understand how a group could commit such a mean act of EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS . the group that shot the fireworks were never caught , which makes this story even EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS . people should be able to express their views in safety .
this story makes me feel EMOANGERNEGATIVESADNESS and EMOANGERNEGATIVE because i hate that it is so easy to obtain guns in this country . i truly believe that there is no EMOPOSITIVE for anyone to have a EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVE and wish that the laws would EMOFEAR to make this the EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS , so i always feel EMOANGERNEGATIVE EMOPOSITIVE about random shootings . i hate that we are EMONEGATIVE to everyone EMOPOSITIVE 's violent whims as EMOANTICIPATION as they can easily purchase a EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVE , so that makes me feel EMOANGERDISGUSTNEGATIVE and also EMONEGATIVESADNESS . i also feel sort of EMONEGATIVESADNESS , since this happens in the news so much it just feels like yet another EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVE story i have to be aware of , it 's tiring .
jose fernandez was a pitcher for the miami marlins and unfortunately died in a EMOPOSITIVE boating EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESSSURPRISE where they rammed a EMOPOSITIVE . i got to read more into his life and upbringing and it 's truly sad to see such a good man EMONEGATIVESADNESS in such a preventable way . i truly feel for all those who suffered his EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS . it 's such a sad event and it 's stuff like this that makes you be more appreciative of the EMOANTICIPATION you have .
i am writing to you regarding the floods in louisiana , and all the EMOANGERFEARSADNESS residents . i try to put myself in their position , and wonder what would be my hearts desire as to a viable EMOPOSITIVE . if it would be more EMOPOSITIVE to relocate to another area , where i can then begin to rebuild my life , and replace that which was EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS . however there is an underlying disadvantage to louisiana , as a whole , if in the EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS so many would want to EMONEGATIVESADNESSSURPRISE and relocate . the state is in a very EMOFEAR and decisive moment , given what they are faced with . especially in the areas of unemployment , on average when someone is having problems finding gainful employment , they will move to another location for work reasons alone , and nothing to do with a natural disaster as louisiana is faced with .
this is EMOANGERDISGUSTFEARNEGATIVE . as many of you know , i am an animal EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST . there is not much that makes me sad , EMOANGERNEGATIVESADNESS and EMOANGERDISGUSTNEGATIVE like any instance of an animal EMODISGUSTFEARNEGATIVESADNESS . what this man did is unforgivable . i hope he has a mental EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS . i can not think of any other EMOPOSITIVE why someone would do something so cruel .
while this seems like good news that there are fewer and fewer cases of erika i would be EMOANGERDISGUSTNEGATIVE if i said it was n't still EMOFEARNEGATIVESURPRISE . it seems very strange that such a huge EMONEGATIVE with a EMOPOSITIVE development and all of the media EMOPOSITIVE is now just a minor issue . it 's either EMOFEAR somewhere are there 's EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS on the way . or it could have all just been media EMOANTICIPATIONNEGATIVE to sell tv . hard to say but EMOANGERANTICIPATIONNEGATIVE all the same .
how can anyone , in this day and age , still believe that climate EMOFEAR is not EMOPOSITIVETRUST ? i imagine it 's the same people who believe the earth is flat . we should be EMOPOSITIVE towards EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST and renewable energy but of course there are fights all across the way because people want to make money . also replacing infrastructure is hard . but , that 's not an EMONEGATIVE when you know that entire parts of the country might expand into a desert . this is especially EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST of north america .
EMOPOSITIVE about articles like this in a country i font care about has no meaning to me . in EMONEGATIVESADNESS class worker in the usa . this EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST of stuff makes no difference in my life because i EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS to even feed my kids . people facing EMONEGATIVESADNESS in other countries is there EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS not mine and i have no EMOPOSITIVETRUST feeling towards those people
it 's sad the train wreck cost 4 people their lives . one can only hope none of the EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS are critical . it would be great if they could find the cause of the EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESSSURPRISE . if they do n't , who 's to say it wo n't EMOANTICIPATION again ? the statistics could be even EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS next EMOANTICIPATION . wish this could have been prevented .
i am at EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESURPRISE for what i have just read . first of all i would need a lot of EMOANTICIPATION to reflect on what just transpired in the article i read . please when you read this try not to get too sad about it because it will get you sad . just try to find someone you EMOJOYPOSITIVE and hold onto them because we should not take for EMOPOSITIVE what we have .
i do n't really like coconuts , i think everyone knows that , but i still think that they play a huge role in our ecosystem . i do n't know a lot about coconuts or what role they play in the environment , but they 're really EMOPOSITIVETRUST for a lot of economies where they are grown . i think that the article brings up a good point by saying that EMOPOSITIVE companies that sell coconut water should be the ones trying to look for a EMOPOSITIVE because they are being over sourced due to high EMOANGERNEGATIVE for their products , so i think that they have a lot of responsibility to try to be the ones to fix this dilemma and solve this coconut EMONEGATIVE . it just makes me EMONEGATIVESADNESS about the environment overall because i really EMOANTICIPATIONFEARNEGATIVESADNESS about global warming and i just really EMOANTICIPATIONFEARNEGATIVESADNESS about the environment in EMOPOSITIVETRUST .
i ca n't even begin to put myself in the shoes of someone who has to deal with preparing to EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS half a dozen times , and then once again , it 's halted , because people above him EMOANGERNEGATIVE over semantics . yes , he did do something EMONEGATIVE , and deserves what he is given , but EMONEGATIVETRUST goes a little too far in how much they can control a persons feelings and life .
heck no , this is one of those topics that i could EMOPOSITIVE about for hours and hours . it is so stressful the EMOTRUST that animals are traded like that , just EMODISGUSTNEGATIVESADNESS . people who do that , should be the ones in the cages . they are not even humans , they are monsters . and of course they have to find a way to EMOJOYPOSITIVESURPRISETRUST the countries what to do when they face this type of situations . and they better do it quick .
this is a sad story . there is a rhino orphanage , but a beloved rhino just passed about . they tried so hard to EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST this rhino , and unfortunately the EMOJOYPOSITIVE rhino named hula is the area that this happened in . it never gets easier . the other rhinos here are being taken care of , but it was a great EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS , and we all feel so bad about it . the name of the EMOJOYPOSITIVE rhino was indivisibly , and she will be missed .
i just read this article about the EMOFEARNEGATIVE of bananas that made me feel like an EMODISGUSTNEGATIVE . i like to think i am smart enough to process this type of article but the EMOANGERNEGATIVE used just had me EMONEGATIVESADNESS . i would n't EMONEGATIVE EMOPOSITIVE it if you still planned on it . it was informative but i felt like i was EMOPOSITIVE a EMOTRUST .
in iraq , islamic state militants are kidnapping thousands of people at gunpoint to use as shields against the u.s. takeover as the militants move to their last stronghold of mosul . this is something that complicates the u.s. airstrikes because it is not certain how many civilians might be EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS or killed since they are being used as shields by the militants . as the militants are squeezed tighter and tighter together in their last stronghold , more and more villages are EMODISGUSTFEARNEGATIVESADNESS , entire villages of people are being taken and used as these shields . it is a terrible situation and i can not imagine the EMODISGUSTFEARNEGATIVESADNESS as people are EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS and EMONEGATIVESADNESS forever from families and leaving many children as orphans .
so a man murdered someone over a card being declined . at a starbucks of course , this is just getting to be EMOANGERDISGUSTNEGATIVE . someone gets pussy because they have no money and decide to EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS someone else that has nothing to do with it . the more news articles i read like this , the less EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST i have in EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST .
this is a big price for reality shows featuring EMODISGUSTNEGATIVE rich people who care more about being seen than being EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST . i 'm sorry , i ca n't feel too bad for EMOPOSITIVETRUST west for being robbed , with so much tempting EMONEGATIVE around . it must have been frightening for her to be tied up , but if i were that rich , i certainly would not EMONEGATIVE it .
i hate when these type of things EMOANTICIPATION . i mean , we EMOTRUST these people with our EMOPOSITIVE , private EMOPOSITIVE , and somehow it just gets hacked ? someone obtained it and now is EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVE hing to sell it to the EMOANTICIPATIONPOSITIVE ? this is EMODISGUSTNEGATIVESADNESS right now . they should have a secure way to EMOPOSITIVE the EMOPOSITIVE we EMOPOSITIVETRUST
it sounds like someone did n't do their EMOPOSITIVE at all in dealing with this housing complex . it sounds like a EMOANGERDISGUSTFEARNEGATIVE situation but not a EMOSURPRISE one in a lot of these countries that EMONEGATIVE housing laws and standards and EMOPOSITIVETRUST . i really hope they are able to rescue anyone still EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST but trapped . on a EMODISGUSTNEGATIVE note , what was with the blurb about the EMOFEAR ? that was random .
this is just EMODISGUSTNEGATIVESADNESS . it kills me that this lady is a parent . i am more confused that the step - EMOTRUST had no idea . i EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESSTRUST after moving to multiple houses that you would not have noticed something was off . i mean you never went into these closets ? the biggest issue here though is that this woman EMOANTICIPATION she would rid herself of a EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS because of social services checking in on her . it is EMOANGERDISGUSTFEARNEGATIVE . i am EMOSURPRISE the other kids survived . they all must have lived in EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVE of this lady . makes me so mad people EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS kids .
people EMOPOSITIVE in financial institutions or banks should be honest and do what is morally right . workers who opened EMONEGATIVE EMOTRUST should be fired , that is unethical . no one would be EMOANTICIPATION such a huge scam at wells fargo . i am deeply saddened , i have an EMOTRUST with wells fargo . i have to be paying close EMOPOSITIVE to my EMOTRUST , one never knows when something will go EMONEGATIVE .
all in all the eu have to help the refugees . we have to treat people like we like to be treated . if there were a EMOFEARNEGATIVE here we also would be EMOFEARNEGATIVE . we are EMOFEARNEGATIVE for violet ’s so they otherwise they would say there . if they are in the eu we have to make sure there are no EMOANGER , so we can still have our peaceful society . and i am sure that we have one thing in comment , we all live on the earth .
i ca n't believe we live in a world where terrorism — both domestic and EMONEGATIVE — are such a looming EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVE . being out in EMOANTICIPATIONPOSITIVE now more EMOFEARNEGATIVE than ever , and it 's all because of the convoluted sociological web of conservative ideology that has promoted domestic terrorism in EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST heterosexual american masculinity and the EMOFEARNEGATIVE that EMOJOYPOSITIVESURPRISETRUST islamic terrorism . there 's just too EMONEGATIVE much hate in this world , and hopefully more people will find EMOJOYPOSITIVE and nurturing like the EMOPOSITIVETRUST of this book EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST while writing about her trauma .
nothing is ever comparable to the support of people who are EMOPOSITIVE EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST to EMOTRUST their support and EMOJOYPOSITIVE to EMOSURPRISE . although sometimes it is hard to think how EMONEGATIVESADNESS it is to EMOPOSITIVE with what EMOSURPRISE 's want for the country . EMOPOSITIVETRUST this EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST of big event is always EMOJOYPOSITIVESURPRISETRUST and will always be remembered by people .
our EMOPOSITIVETRUST party people are making something EMONEGATIVE on some occasions , you see ‘ silicon valley ’ stars recount being harassed by donald EMOSURPRISE supporters . some one insulting EMOSURPRISE and making EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVE with them , its not necessary . unwanted fights and unwanted EMOPOSITIVE should be avoided . because all are having EMOPOSITIVETRUST position and work to do , at bar doing nasty things no good using some people name
i read an article about the EMONEGATIVE ads in online media and how it may be affecting children . it was about how kids see ads for EMONEGATIVE EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST when they go online . they also spend a lot of EMOANTICIPATION online , especially on youtube . the videos on there are more EMOPOSITIVETRUST , since they are EMOPOSITIVETRUST people , and the ads are more EMOTRUST . the article made me not want to let the kids EMOANTICIPATIONFEAR youtube or go online , which is really hard to do . i hate that the advertising industry seems to control all of our online media .
the disgust i have while EMOPOSITIVE this story . no one should send there EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVE to EMOTRUST to EMOPOSITIVE and have to EMOANTICIPATIONFEARNEGATIVESADNESS about sexual EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVE in any form . she makes other teachers look bad . taking a EMOANTICIPATIONFEARNEGATIVESADNESS deal was her best EMOPOSITIVE . there is never an EMOPOSITIVE EMOPOSITIVE for something like this to EMOANTICIPATION . the EMOTRUST she had a EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVESURPRISE EMOJOYPOSITIVE too is scary .
i absolutely hate seeing this EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST of violent racism in the world . too many people think that just because someone is different they are less EMOPOSITIVETRUST of life than themselves . it is honestly just terrible . it feels like we are seeing more and more of this everyday . humans really need to come together and realize that we are all the same , and there is not EMOPOSITIVE to cause each other EMOFEARNEGATIVE and EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS such as this .
hey my best EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST joseph , how have you been ? do you believe this ? there were thousands of females that left work in iceland and went to australasia square in the icelandic capital of reykjavik to protest , there is discrimination against women cause they get paid way less then men do . sucks we are still living a society where woman are not created or treated EMOPOSITIVETRUST .
it 's hard to imagine the life of people who left everything they had – of course , many of them had already EMONEGATIVESADNESS most of what they had – and started impossibly EMOANTICIPATION and EMONEGATIVE journeys to secure a better life for themselves and their family . imagine having nothing but the clothes on your back , not EMOPOSITIVE where your next meal is going to come from , but still hoping for a EMOSURPRISE to rebuild your life . it ’s heart breaking .
" i think it is really fucked up that people EMOANTICIPATIONPOSITIVETRUST to EMODISGUSTNEGATIVE with the environment . corporations and these oil fuckers should stopped . they are damaging the environment to no end ! someone needs to sit down with ceo and ask them , " " why do you want billions if you wo n't be able to EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST it in the future when the environment is EMOPOSITIVE fucked ? " " seriously , where is a ceo going to travel to EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST his millions and stay at EMOJOYPOSITIVE resort villas when the environment is EMOPOSITIVE fucked ? the EMOJOYPOSITIVE resort will be gone ! ! his EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST will end up amounting to nothing when he ca n't even EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST it . his future children will have millions passed down but they wo n't EMOPOSITIVETRUST EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST it because the planet will be fucked ! what the fuck ? these people are morally fucking EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS , only EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS they 'll ever know . "
i could care less what isis does as EMOANTICIPATION its not done in my country . i think they should all be put to death and be done with it . they are a terrorist group and deserve all the bad things that are going to EMOANTICIPATION to them . i do feel bad for the lose of life and feel EMOPOSITIVESADNESS for the families of the officers killed .
nothing gets to me more than EMOFEARNEGATIVE about EMOANTICIPATIONNEGATIVE children . nobody should go EMOANTICIPATIONNEGATIVE . there 's so much EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST in this world . it breaks my heart to hear about kids EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESSSURPRISE in EMOTRUST because they 've only had one meal for the day . i wish there was a way to help these kids more directly . i 'm not one to give to large non - profit organizations but i feel so bad for these kids .
after EMOPOSITIVE this story i think the right decision was made . it seems to me that the man had no EMOPOSITIVE to EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVE at those kids just because they were playing loud EMOJOYPOSITIVESADNESS . sure EMOJOYPOSITIVESADNESS can be EMOANGERNEGATIVE but no one deserves to be shot over it . i do n't think that any changes need to be made to the stand your EMOTRUST laws . this was a simple EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS of someone making poor choices and now needs to EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST the price for their actions .
as much as i EMOJOYPOSITIVE dogs i must say this was totally the owners EMONEGATIVESADNESS . the EMOFEARTRUST was the dog needed to be on a leash . the woman did not follow the rules and the dog ran over to a EMOFEARNEGATIVE . the dog scared the EMOFEARNEGATIVE as is EMOANTICIPATION . i have had many big scary dogs running towards me and was n't sure if it was going to EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVE me or be nice . the man got scared and shot the dog . its sad but the man did not know if the dog was going to EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVE him .
i think it is a EMODISGUSTFEARNEGATIVESADNESS that people still lose their lives on trails . some do not appreciate the dangers of mother nature and try to best her without realizing what they are up against . it is always EMOPOSITIVETRUST to EMOANTICIPATIONPOSITIVE before you go out on a hike . without EMOPOSITIVETRUST what you are doing , a person could easily end up EMONEGATIVESADNESS or dead .
it 's such a EMODISGUSTFEARNEGATIVESADNESS that so much EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS takes place over there each year . you 'd think all the different factions would finally EMOPOSITIVE to EMOANGERNEGATIVE and move on but instead they just seem to want to keep EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS . i understand why since so many different groups want to destroy the other side leaving smaller nations like yemen to have to EMOFEARPOSITIVE themselves since the other factions seem to be EMONEGATIVESADNESS to EMONEGATIVESADNESSSURPRISE in EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST .
this article about post - EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS EMONEGATIVE EMOFEARNEGATIVE is disturbing on many levels . this country really does n't take care of our veterans . not to mention the EMOTRUST that vietnam and iraq were unnecessary wars in the first place . i EMOANTICIPATIONFEARNEGATIVESADNESS we 're headed for another EMOFEARNEGATIVE , and with the va in the state that it 's in , how can they possibly care for more EMOFEARNEGATIVE veterans ? they ca n't meet the needs of the ones who already need help . it 's heartbreaking to imagine these soldiers re - experiencing the EMOFEARNEGATIVE over and over again . however , i am EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVE to hear that there is help for people who have potsdam . i remember when we were kids and first EMOFEARNEGATIVE about potsdam in vietnam vets , it was EMOANTICIPATION that no one ever recovered from it . EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST is possible , but the vets have to find the right people to help them .
thomas referred the EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS to the EMOPOSITIVE EMOANGERANTICIPATIONFEAR , and EMOANTICIPATION before midnight , the justices issued an order granting arthur ’s stay request . the order EMOPOSITIVE a EMOPOSITIVETRUST from chief EMOPOSITIVETRUST EMODISGUSTNEGATIVE g. roberts jr. explaining that while he did not believe this EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS merited a review from the EMOPOSITIVE EMOANGERANTICIPATIONFEAR , he had decided to vote for a stay anyway as a EMOPOSITIVE to his colleagues . roberts wrote that four of the other justices had voted in favor of staying the execution . while it takes five justices to EMONEGATIVE a EMONEGATIVESADNESS EMOANGERANTICIPATIONFEAR ruling , it takes only four to accept a EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS . “ to EMOPOSITIVE them the EMOANTICIPATIONPOSITIVE to more EMOPOSITIVETRUST consider the suitability of this EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS for review , EMOPOSITIVE these circumstances , i vote to EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST the stay as a EMOPOSITIVE , ” he wrote . justices thomas and samuel ali to would have EMONEGATIVE the require
" it is just so messed up that there are so many places in the world without easy access to EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST water . the answer is never to privatize or " " modernize " " the water EMOTRUST of a place , as that is really just an EMONEGATIVE to implement political policies . it is just EMONEGATIVESURPRISE that our modern water systems in urban areas are so EMODISGUSTNEGATIVESADNESS EMONEGATIVE . even desert areas of india get enough rainfall each year that a simple catchment EMOTRUST would solve all of a EMOPOSITIVE 's problems . "
" another muslim attacking americans right here at home and you hardly hear or see anything about all these smaller attacks happening to regular people every day all over the country . and of course , they chime right in with excuses and the " " do n't judge us all " " when they do nothing to stop it . they do n't even EMOANGERNEGATIVE it at all , which really telling . "
although coal keels i did EMOPOSITIVE that coal is EMOPOSITIVETRUST for caseload energy generation , coal plants are EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST and easy to maintain and the fuel can easily be transported and the residue EMOANTICIPATIONPOSITIVETRUST of . coal ( with varying qualities ) is an EMOJOYPOSITIVE resource , available to many countries within their borders . uranium on the other hand requires a lot more work and safety precautions before reaching a point where it can be used as nuclear fuel . india is EMONEGATIVESADNESS as EMOPOSITIVETRUST to be on the short end of the stick .
i had no earthly idea wearing EMOPOSITIVE lenses required this amount of EMOFEARNEGATIVE in order to EMOFEARNEGATIVE potential problems . i would much EMOPOSITIVETRUST to stick with glasses . what particularly concerns me is the potential for scarring on the cornea and any possible EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS of visual EMOPOSITIVE . frankly , i do n't like the idea of sticking something in my eye to begin with , and this has turned me off from EMOPOSITIVE lenses forever .
i feel bad for these sisters ' family . until we find out more from the EMODISGUSTFEARNEGATIVESADNESS report though , we probably should n't EMOJOYPOSITIVE to conclusions . i do n't know much about what could cause pulmonary edema , but maybe it was due to something they both ate , or an EMOFEARNEGATIVE that they both came down with , or something unrelated to EMOANGERDISGUSTFEARNEGATIVE play .
this article is EMOPOSITIVE . i EMOSURPRISE there is EMOANTICIPATIONFEARNEGATIVE with everything and now men conceived through iv may have trouble conceiving themselves . i 'm EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVE i did n't have to go the iv route , although i EMOSURPRISE it 's not a sure thing that the men conceived through iv will have a EMONEGATIVESADNESS sperm EMOPOSITIVETRUST , but i EMOSURPRISE the EMOANTICIPATIONFEARNEGATIVE is higher . i do n't think there are too many people that know about this EMOPOSITIVE . it 's the first EMOANTICIPATION i 've ever heard of it .
i think its fine that people protest . i EMOANGERDISGUSTNEGATIVE EMOPOSITIVETRUST EMOSURPRISE as much as those protesters . but what they are doing its EMONEGATIVE . they ca nt be EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS property or been a EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVE for other people . guys , do it peacefully , that 's the best way to do things , otherwise you will get arrested and in trouble .
wow . so ... i sure as fuck do not have that much to say about that EMONEGATIVE article / news story . but , i EMOSURPRISE that i 'll try to think of something . it 's also not at all something that i would EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST or want to EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST with anyone that i know . it 's not EMOPOSITIVETRUST to me or the people that i know and care about . it 's not something that i would just choose to read either . ok . have you seen this article about the dad that killed his EMOJOYPOSITIVE 's molester ? apparently she was molested when she was EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVESURPRISE , the guy went to EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS for a year and a half and was let out . many years later , the dad went and shot the guy . that 's EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST much it . i do n't know why i 'm sending this to you , but what do you think ? i think that it was EMONEGATIVE and i was n't interested in it at all .
i read an article about using the internet and computers in the classroom , and how it affects kids . the article mainly talked about e - rate , a EMOFEARNEGATIVE program to subsidize the internet and broadband access . it said that most classrooms are now connected , but the millions of dollars are still being EMONEGATIVE . the program seemed to be EMODISGUSTFEARNEGATIVESADNESS a lot of money and was n't showing good results . i EMOPOSITIVE that just buying computers and being on the internet does n't EMOPOSITIVETRUST that kids are EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVESURPRISE a good education .
did you know that saudi woman needs a man 's EMOPOSITIVE for like everything ? to work , to rent a flat , to get EMOANTICIPATIONFEARPOSITIVETRUST treatment . what is really sad is that even if she is widowed sometimes her son is asked for EMOPOSITIVE . there is a protest going on right now to get them to be able to be their own guardians after a certain age . i am very EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST of these woman for EMOANGERNEGATIVE for their rights . i hope i get to read another article at a later date saying some EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST of EMOTRUST was passed to let them have their own rights .
did you hear what is happening in aleppo ? residents are being tested ( apparently from their EMOFEARNEGATIVE ) to EMOFEARNEGATIVE their homes in EMOANTICIPATION of the city being EMODISGUSTNEGATIVE ! it ’s just terrible what those people have to EMOPOSITIVE . i feel so bad for them . their country is already so EMOFEARNEGATIVE EMONEGATIVE , and they are almost out of EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST . 2 pounds of meat costs $ 40 . i ca n’t even begin to imagine what these people are going through . if it we here , happening to our families , i would be so scared .
what wo n’t people post ? some mom posted a picture on instagram of her 2 - day - old c - section scar to remind people that it ’s no picnic . i EMOSURPRISE it ’s an unsolicited EMOANTICIPATIONPOSITIVE service message of sorts . she had some sort of EMOFEARNEGATIVE that made it necessary . she had the EMOJOYPOSITIVE and that ’s the god news . EMOANTICIPATIONSURPRISE , she got about 1200 “ likes ” in total . i EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST myself EMONEGATIVESADNESS to out of EMOPOSITIVESADNESS . who needs birth control with this EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST of publicity ? she says she loves her scar . go figure … all in all , i think she ’s EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST it ’s over .
hello EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST , it 's sad that thousands of hectares of tropical forests in latin america have been changed from their natural EMOPOSITIVE to EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST bananas . the rise of different types of diseases that EMOPOSITIVE on banana tress is EMOFEARNEGATIVESURPRISE . i hope we can find a cure for these diseases before it 's too EMONEGATIVESADNESS . i did not realize bananas were a genetic EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESSSURPRISE . EMOJOYPOSITIVESURPRISE for us !
hello there . i just read this story about a EMOFEARTRUST who killed a totally unarmed EMONEGATIVESADNESS man and i think it is EMOANGERDISGUSTFEARNEGATIVE . the EMOFEARPOSITIVETRUST has been very EMONEGATIVE against blacks lately and this is just another example of how bad things have gotten . i think this EMOFEARTRUST needs to be sentenced severely so that all other cops can also refrain from doing the same
hey you , i EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST more EMOPOSITIVE about that woman who overdosed in the car with her infant . it is just EMOANGERDISGUSTFEARNEGATIVE . from what i am EMOPOSITIVE it happened in indiana and she had a EMOFEAR in her hand . her poor EMOJOYPOSITIVE was only 10 months old . how sad . they were parked outside of a dollar EMOPOSITIVETRUST when thankfully someone noticed and called 911 . the EMOPOSITIVE got EMOPOSITIVETRUST over the EMOJOYPOSITIVE , thank goodness . the women got booked on EMONEGATIVE and EMOANGERDISGUSTFEARNEGATIVE , hopefully she stays in there for awhile .
hey , check out this article about potsdam . i feel bad for these veterans that had to experience this as a EMOANTICIPATION from the vietnam EMOFEARNEGATIVE . i know someone that has fought in the vietnam EMOFEARNEGATIVE and he has seen other soldiers being diagnosed as a EMOANTICIPATION of the EMOFEARNEGATIVE . it 's sad to see these soldiers go through so much trauma and disgust after the EMOFEARNEGATIVE . with the increasing rate of the mental health issue , it makes me EMOANTICIPATIONFEARNEGATIVESADNESS even more .
the good news is we live in a place that does not have much air EMODISGUSTNEGATIVE . the bad news is that people that have lung cancer that is EMONEGATIVE to air EMODISGUSTNEGATIVE may have a shorter survival EMOANTICIPATION . air EMODISGUSTNEGATIVE kills thousands of people each year . researchers claim that the median survival for people diagnosed with early stages of lung cancer is EMOANTICIPATION to live 3 times shorter amount of EMOANTICIPATION than those that do not . of course , we all should stay away from EMONEGATIVE smoke but it is EMONEGATIVESADNESS that we have air EMODISGUSTNEGATIVE . they can figure out a way to get to the moon but can not seem to figure out a way to EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST our air .
" why do people think they can just illegally enter a country ? the article sounds so sympathetic and EMOANGERNEGATIVE . why do people act like EMOANTICIPATION here illegally is not breaking a EMOTRUST ? " " they have n't EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS any laws ! " " yes , they have . you EMOSURPRISE the EMOTRUST when you enter illegally ! what the fuck ! and you got EMONEGATIVEPOSITIVE scholars EMOPOSITIVE immigrants , repeating that EMONEGATIVE of , " " they do n't EMOSURPRISE any laws ! " " what the fuck ? as a mexican , i am appalled by other mexicans EMOPOSITIVE this EMONEGATIVE and seeing mexico EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST this illegal immigration EMOANGERDISGUSTNEGATIVE . mexico needs to fix itself so that it can house people that wo n't want to run away from it . fuck mexico , they have ruined a lot of lives and they are not held EMOPOSITIVETRUST . EMONEGATIVE being politically correct about mexico . hold them EMOPOSITIVETRUST . "
these poor people . i hope the researchers can find a way to help them . the EMOANTICIPATION that you ca n't even use the water that is deep in the EMOTRUST due to EMODISGUSTFEARNEGATIVESADNESS EMODISGUSTNEGATIVE is EMOANGERDISGUSTFEARNEGATIVE . this is a sign of the times , however , and i believe as populations EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST , water is going to be a big commodity due to the EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS of EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST water .
i do n't like the EMOTRUST that environmental concerns are still a large part of our world in which we live but i believe the higher power controls this and that will keep us from ever EMOPOSITIVE overcoming these issues . it makes me EMOANGERNEGATIVESADNESS to know native american tribes are being affected by EMONEGATIVE to the point of possibly ceasing to exist . i have native american EMOTRUST and feel that this EMOPOSITIVE should be cared for by our EMOFEARNEGATIVE before segments of third world countries . i do n't like the EMOTRUST that air EMODISGUSTNEGATIVE is a EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS or a salty lake is drying up in iran but i understand our environment is controlled by god . we , as a EMOTRUST , choose our battles sometimes based on the EMONEGATIVE things . taking care of the native american tribesman should be a huge priority !
i had n't heard about this and i find it EMOSURPRISE . i initially EMOANTICIPATION of the ecological factor so it 's a good thing that it was contained . it 's worrisome that people are struggling to find gas anywhere . i imagine those areas do n't have good options for EMOANTICIPATIONPOSITIVE transportation or anything . maybe it will push people to get smart cars or ride bikes .
i really hate isis . they EMOANTICIPATIONPOSITIVETRUST to be the EMODISGUSTNEGATIVE on society by committing atrocities condemned by every EMOTRUST in the world . they must be stopped at all costs and they must be EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS so that they wo nt EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS another soul . these poor people who are trying to EMOPOSITIVE get killed , imprisoned , or brainwashed into joining and there seems to be no way to stop them .
i was EMOPOSITIVE where chicago , illinois has an incredible EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS with EMOPOSITIVE in their EMOANTICIPATIONPOSITIVE EMONEGATIVE fountains . this EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS is all over in EMOANTICIPATIONPOSITIVE buildings , parks and even in homes where EMOPOSITIVE pipes are still in EMOPOSITIVE . this is a EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS that can have both immediate and EMOANTICIPATION - range problems for adults and children in the city . children growing up EMONEGATIVE this polluted water can have many health problems EMOPOSITIVE EMOPOSITIVE disabilities , behavioral problems and a variety of diseases . the homeless are also prone to having problems because they rely on EMOANTICIPATIONPOSITIVE EMONEGATIVE fountains every day .
" darrell issac is considered the " " mini EMOSURPRISE " " to many voters . to my republican friends who support this EMOPOSITIVE i just have a few opinions of my own . first i would say issac never receded his support for EMOSURPRISE after the EMOANGERDISGUSTFEARNEGATIVE hollywood access recording . for somebody who peach 's morals its EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST of EMODISGUSTNEGATIVE . mr. issac has been motivated by EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVE of political repercussions more than his constituents ’ best interests . he is now trying to distance himself from EMOSURPRISE because polling suggests that EMOPOSITIVETRUST him is not in his best EMOPOSITIVE for reelection . this guy has no morals and should not be EMOPOSITIVE for his EMOPOSITIVETRUST flip flopping . "
climate EMOFEAR is extremely worrisome . and it is getting EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS and EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS every year . something has to be done about it , and i think it starts with getting rid of corporate contributions to politicians and getting rid of lobbying . the world is dying and i think that needs to be clearly communicated to as many people as possible . too many ceo 's are thinking about their own profits . the EMOTRUST needs to limit their power and EMOANTICIPATION focusing on the health of the species and the planet instead .
as frustrating as it might be for the EMONEGATIVE of goldfish EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVE in wildlife , i am very curious to see a four - EMOANGERNEGATIVE goldfish . could you imagine ? the pettiness inside me EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST of smirks at the growing EMOPOSITIVE of them . there is nothing to EMOANGERDISGUSTNEGATIVE for the existing and EMOPOSITIVE EMOPOSITIVE of goldfish , except for ourselves . i mean their very EMOPOSITIVE is because people wanted more appealing fish for their gardens and maybe aquariums too . then they were bred and still are bred for trinkets and given away as promotional items . so i feel we as people have no right to EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVE at the survival of the discarded lives that were no longer wanted . i say,'you go goldfish ! live your best lives ! '
what a terrifying EMOANGERNEGATIVESURPRISE that these plaintiffs went through . if i was them , i would be suing whoever was EMOPOSITIVETRUST , too . i try to EMOFEARNEGATIVE putting myself into situations like these , but life often does not care what you want . i hope that these people get the EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVESADNESS that they are seeking . i know i would want EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVESADNESS .
i 'm sorry to hear what happened to the people in the pulse EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVE . it is not justified to use EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS against anyone who has not initiated EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS towards you . that being said i understand why the authorities would want to EMONEGATIVE people who EMOPOSITIVE EMOANTICIPATIONFEARNEGATIVE lifestyles from donating blood . the last thing we want is to have a blood EMOPOSITIVE that 's EMODISGUSTFEARNEGATIVESADNESS with diseases because of the practices of people who engage in EMOANTICIPATIONFEARNEGATIVE lifestyle choices and also sinful ones as well . no EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS should never be the answer to people no matter what their lifestyle , but one should never EMOPOSITIVE something that is bad for society in the EMOANTICIPATION run .
this is such a terrible thing to EMOANTICIPATION to so many people . i wonder how a town can meaningfully bounce back and rebuild their lives . i do n't know what i would do if this happened to me . move ? work on recreating the city ? turn to the EMOFEARNEGATIVE for hope ? it just seems so EMOPOSITIVE and EMONEGATIVESADNESS . i feel so EMOPOSITIVE to have avoided such an experience . i wonder if there is anything i can do to help .
EMOJOYPOSITIVE ponds ' playing role ' in frog disease spread — EMOJOYPOSITIVE ponds are playing a role in the spread of deadly frog diseases across the uk , a EMOPOSITIVE suggests . retroviruses can EMODISGUSTNEGATIVE amphibians , reptiles and fish . in the uk , they have devastated common frog populations . this research suggests that the introduction of infected animals from aquatic retailers into ponds or moving species between different ponds may be exacerbating the EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS .
while i do EMOSADNESS with the plight of back people and latest EMOFEARPOSITIVETRUST EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS , i think that they are not helping the situation by EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST in violent protests that take even more lives and EMOJOYPOSITIVE a great deal of disturbance in usa ! these protests ignite racial tensions but will not bring back the lives of EMOPOSITIVETRUST victims . what needs to be done here is clamping tight on the EMOFEARPOSITIVETRUST EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVE - EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS them appropriately and in the harshest of form if they take an EMOPOSITIVETRUST life or EMOANGERDISGUSTNEGATIVE EMONEGATIVESADNESS people for no EMOPOSITIVE ! they need to undergo training and psychological evaluation before being allowed to go out there and deal with criminals ! they need to be psychologically EMOPOSITIVETRUST and clear of racial EMOANGERNEGATIVE , otherwise they are not EMOPOSITIVE for this EMOPOSITIVE !
this article is extremely sad for the state of louisiana . not only has the state been ravaged by floods EMOTRUST to the EMOANGERDISGUSTNEGATIVESADNESS of both homes and businesses , but now the EMOTRUST is being further devastated by the exodus of individuals and EMOPOSITIVE EMONEGATIVE from per - katrina years . the state needs an EMOFEAR of capital to help individuals and EMONEGATIVE businesses get their feet back underneath them , and EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST the EMOPOSITIVE of the local economies to not only sustain themselves and thrive .
it should be easily doable to help others but i d why no one even tries anymore . it should be easily doable to help others but i d why no one even tries anymore . it should be easily doable to help others but i d why no one even tries anymore . it should be easily doable to help others but i d why no one even tries anymore . it should be easily doable to help others but i d why no one even tries anymore . it should be easily doable to help others but i d why no one even tries anymore . it should be easily doable to help others but i d why no one even tries anymore .
hey , i think you should be EMOPOSITIVE around the EMOTRUST burg area next EMOANTICIPATION you EMOPOSITIVE pennsylvania . the EMOANGERNEGATIVE has been increasingly more EMOFEARNEGATIVE within the past few years . according to this article that i read online , a EMOFEARPOSITIVETRUST EMOPOSITIVETRUST was shot to death and another EMOFEARPOSITIVETRUST EMOPOSITIVETRUST was EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS in an EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESURPRISE . i feel that if you were to come down to EMOPOSITIVE the area , then there would be something similar happening to other people . ambushes , riots , and shootings are all problems occurring in the area . i feel bad for this city as it has a EMOSURPRISE to redeem itself as a great city ; however , with all the EMOANGERDISGUSTFEARNEGATIVE activities happening , it makes it EMOFEAR to do that .
thinking about water EMODISGUSTNEGATIVE is a scary EMOANTICIPATION . when that can effect our children it makes things even EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS . the EMONEGATIVE in flint is EMONEGATIVESADNESS and to hear about the EMONEGATIVE fountain in chicago makes things even EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS . it makes you think that EMOPOSITIVE improvements need to made across the us . new laws need to be put in place to ensure everyone is getting EMOPOSITIVE water .
i just heard about more poaching of rhinos , animals in EMOPOSITIVETRUST ! this one was a EMONEGATIVESADNESS rhino very old , but what i do n't understand is why people are so money focused and are willing to EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS for it ? out of all the ways we could be making money why is EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS animals something EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS if we just EMONEGATIVESADNESSSURPRISE them alone , the EMOPOSITIVE EMOPOSITIVE for money for some ? i 've never had a desire to EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS an animal for any EMOPOSITIVE , you ?
i just read an article about kids being killed on halloween night . it 's an awful EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS that we need to try to EMOFEAR . because someone was driving EMONEGATIVE , kids were killed . halloween is a EMOANTICIPATION to have EMOPOSITIVETRUST EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVE and some guy took it to the extremes . it 's sad , and i feel for those parents . no parent should have to EMOSADNESS their EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVE .
hey i feel like EMOSURPRISE winning was way EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS than people EMOANTICIPATION . the amount of violent attacks on minorities and in EMOPOSITIVETRUST have increased considerably . there have been over 200 attacks since election day can you imagine that ? i hate that EMOSURPRISE supporters somehow feel EMOPOSITIVE with their awful racism .
i do n't think that it is EMOPOSITIVE to compare EMOPOSITIVETRUST EMOSURPRISE to nazi germany or the holocaust . i am not a fan of EMOPOSITIVETRUST EMOSURPRISE by any means , but i also have not once EMOANTICIPATION about comparing him to such a horrific part of the history of this world . jews should not be EMONEGATIVESADNESS that there will be another holocaust or that they will have to go back into concentration camps . i do n't think the country would ever let that EMOANTICIPATION again , and i do n't think that donald EMOSURPRISE would go down that road either . he has a tendency to act like a EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVE , but that would be a far stretch , even for him .
i heard almost 80 people died from an EMOFEARNEGATIVESURPRISE . it was caused by lightening or something . EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS huh ? i hope nothing like that every happens here during a fuel EMONEGATIVE . over 100 were EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS . so sad . i wonder what all those people who survived are going to do . maybe the red EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS will set up something . how can i find out ?
an animal EMOPOSITIVETRUST did not take care of animals properly . there was complaints by an employee about horrid conditions that the owner did not do anything about . animal centers are not regulated so the owners do whatever they want without consequences . dogs died of heat EMOANTICIPATIONNEGATIVESADNESS because they were not supervised and did not have EMOPOSITIVE ventilation in a room known to get bey EMOANGER .
man it EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS i just read an article about a disaster that struck collation , brazil . the disaster struck when a dam ruptured and polluted the most EMOPOSITIVETRUST river in brazil where people were getting their foods and surviving from what the river had to EMOPOSITIVE . now it it polluted with mining EMODISGUSTNEGATIVE because of the EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESSSURPRISE of the dam . i feel really bad that they are in a position where they ca nt even EMOPOSITIVE the fish in the river because the fish showed some EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST of mutation because of the EMODISGUSTNEGATIVE . it really sucks that a company just pays a minimal amount after causing a huge disaster like this totally EMOANGERDISGUSTNEGATIVESADNESS
jeez , who would have EMOANTICIPATION that those little guys could EMOANGERNEGATIVE such environmental disaster . but this is a EMOPOSITIVE example of people who think their one indiscretion ( dumping the fish in the river ) is harmless . much like someone who starts a forest EMOFEAR , we should have laws making the person EMOPOSITIVETRUST liable for the cost of EMOPOSITIVE up the EMODISGUSTNEGATIVE . not that we 'd ever EMOSURPRISE them .
an agency that i ca n't recall the EMOPOSITIVE EMOPOSITIVETRUST of just released EMOTRUST of the EMOTRUST that the earth is getting warmer . yeah , it was only a couple of degrees but that 's how it starts , right ? something is causing the world , the EMOPOSITIVETRUST states in particular , to warm up . i know where i live that it 's seems a lot warm than it was even 7 or 8 years ago . the seasons used to be predictable , but they do n't seem to be that way anymore .
i do n't believe this at all . i think people are overreacting to the news that EMOSURPRISE was elected EMOPOSITIVETRUST . there are always bad apples out there , no matter who the EMOPOSITIVETRUST is . to EMOANGERDISGUSTNEGATIVE this on the EMOPOSITIVETRUST , right after he was even elected , is EMONEGATIVE . give the guy a EMOSURPRISE and get over it and try to make something positive of this .
so i just read an article about climate EMOFEAR , and it is awful . it seems very few people are trying to stop it and it is maddening . we need to take more control over the things that are being put into the air that could be causing such an EMOANGERDISGUSTNEGATIVE thing . we need to EMOANTICIPATION reusing things and switching to organically grown things , if possible . the oceans and lakes are EMODISGUSTFEARNEGATIVESADNESS and eventually , we will , too .
" here 's one more great EMOPOSITIVE to never allow sharia EMOTRUST into the us in any way , EMOPOSITIVE , or form . this is EMOANTICIPATIONTRUST in the arab world , where women are treated essentially as slaves or EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS , while men can do anything they want and get away with it . what a terrible EMOPOSITIVE of " " EMOPOSITIVETRUST " " or " " EMOTRUST " " . this poor women would 've , at best , been scarred for the EMOPOSITIVE of her life just on the grounds of being raped by multiple men . i can only imagine how EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS this is for her when she 's thrown in EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS after being the EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS of a EMOANGERDISGUSTFEARNEGATIVE EMOANGERNEGATIVE ! EMOANGERDISGUSTFEARNEGATIVE ! "
the situation in yemen with the saudi - led EMOPOSITIVE against the outhit rebels is one with a lot of EMONEGATIVE , and for good EMOPOSITIVE . this EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS is EMONEGATIVE with airstrikes and EMONEGATIVE strikes that drop on civilians and militants alike . qatar is EMONEGATIVE in the slaughter of citizens , which puts them firmly against the geneva conventions . of course , i do not celebrate the EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS of their soldiers ' lives , as their families back home are just regular citizens as well in all likelihood .
these poor people ! it seems like they really ca n't EMOSURPRISE a EMOSURPRISE . like it is n't bad enough that they are already trying to dig themselves out of their EMONEGATIVESADNESS economic situation and EMOANGERNEGATIVESADNESS their homes , but now they also have to EMOANTICIPATIONFEARNEGATIVESADNESS about a EMOPOSITIVE EMONEGATIVE . it 's EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST clear that we need more EMOPOSITIVE and more help for these people in the area .
" the only EMOPOSITIVE for the " " wage EMONEGATIVE " " is the total establishment of capitalism and all governments . there will be no more wage EMONEGATIVE when there is no money ! by instituting EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVE - EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS , all people can be given what they need without a EMOANTICIPATIONFEARNEGATIVESADNESS of who is getting more or less . capitalism is evil and must be EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS ! "
EMOPOSITIVE EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST , i just read a ridiculously vapid article about kim EMOPOSITIVETRUST and her posting photos of her jewelry on instagram . she was nearly mugged last year and the article is explaining how its a bad idea for her to EMOTRUST off her expensive diamonds online . i think this story is silly and weightless and i font really see how anyone could care about it .
" i never read up much on thailand , but it seems as if the place might EMOFEAR a lot in the near future . the EMOPOSITIVE died , and the queen is dying . there is some EMOFEARNEGATIVE EMOPOSITIVETRUST who is taking over now . the people of thailand , loved their EMOPOSITIVE , and he gave them a EMOPOSITIVE of stability , in a EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS political climate . they mourned the former EMOPOSITIVE for a month , and now the queens death , may follow very soon . i am EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVE , though i never think about it , how EMOJOYPOSITIVESURPRISE i am to be in a country with some " " EMOPOSITIVE " " of stability , and not ruled in EMOPOSITIVETRUST flux . "
i read an article about this man who EMONEGATIVE a EMODISGUST - eating EMODISGUSTFEARNEGATIVESADNESS and almost died from it , unfortunately it did n't tell me where or how he EMONEGATIVE the EMODISGUST eating EMODISGUSTFEARNEGATIVESADNESS . i 'm not sure i would know in EMOANTICIPATION that i had a EMODISGUST eating EMODISGUSTFEARNEGATIVESADNESS , scary right ! ? ! have you ever known anyone or heard of anyone contracting a EMODISGUST eating EMODISGUSTFEARNEGATIVESADNESS ?
this is another example of the racism in this country , the officers again use extreme deadly EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVE against a EMONEGATIVESADNESS person , just because he was EMONEGATIVESADNESS , he was not a EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVE and yet they shot him without EMOFEARNEGATIVE . we feel more EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS with officers around than EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST , and still they can EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS people and get away with it .
wow … yet another angle from which to look at climate EMOFEAR . and of course , it ’s EMOANGERDISGUSTFEARNEGATIVE and not EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST . but it ’s also really EMOPOSITIVE to see how all the stakeholders in a big industry like coffee are aware of climate EMOFEAR and its dangers , have been for a while , and are actively EMOPOSITIVE at trying to EMONEGATIVE its impact on their business . and yet , others have their heads firmly EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS in the sand and EMONEGATIVE nothing ’s happening .
hey i just saw this post and this is so sad that the kids in venezuela do not have enough to EMOPOSITIVE can you believe that some kids only EMOPOSITIVE a EMOANGERDISGUSTNEGATIVE meal for one whole day instead of three EMOPOSITIVE course meals i can not even believe that what is happening o the world where we raw more EMOFEARSADNESS about putting money into guns and creating ar when we have bigger issue son our hands such as ch hunger that these people are EMODISGUSTFEARNEGATIVESADNESS and there kids so many kids are EMODISGUSTFEARNEGATIVESADNESS and even EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESSSURPRISE
this article is so sad the hatred and EMOANGERNEGATIVE we have towards one another in america needs to stop . our children and EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST are going to EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST up in a horrid place simply because we have people in our country who EMONEGATIVE to let go of the past . the past is in the past so let it stay in the past for EMONEGATIVESADNESS out loud .
kkk is filled with losers . not sure why they get any EMOPOSITIVE . actually , i know exactly why they get EMOPOSITIVE . it makes EMOSURPRISE look bad . since that is the goal of the media , they will not pass this EMOSURPRISE up . kkk has been EMONEGATIVE for decades . this is still the EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS . media can make them look EMOPOSITIVETRUST , but they are not .
this story left me feeling EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST confused . it was so short and did n't EMOPOSITIVETRUST a lot of answers at all . i was left wondering why france wanted to dismantle the camp and why the refugees were so EMOANGERDISGUSTNEGATIVE and against the move . what was really going on here ? were there some other issues that had nothing to do with humanitarian considerations ? it seems like there 's usually more to the story with EMOSADNESS stories .
this is a EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST example of why we need cameras everywhere . they have this guy on video doing all the bad things he would do . there is no way anyone can make any excuses for him now . they will surely try , though . bl will probably come up with some story about how he was an upstanding EMOPOSITIVE or something we have already heard before .
i feel like a similar scenario happens at least once a year in hollywood . when i hear about stories that EMOANTICIPATION in hollywood , the lifestyles are so different than mine that it 's almost like it 's not EMOPOSITIVETRUST , like it 's a movie . people in hollywood always have something to EMOANGERNEGATIVESADNESS about so it 's hard to feel EMOPOSITIVESADNESS for them , even when something like this happens .
so i just read this article on EMOPOSITIVE fish in the EMONEGATIVESURPRISE . wow . i learned a lot . apparently we have an EMONEGATIVESADNESS of EMOPOSITIVE fish in our lakes and rivers , which is very bad for the fish and the earth . it 's bad for the earth because it messes with the sediments as they EMOANTICIPATIONFEARJOYPOSITIVE low on the EMONEGATIVESADNESS . it is also bad for the fish because they are n't bread for the big waters . their bodies EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST as big as a EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVE and they can EMOANTICIPATIONTRUST up to 4 pounds . some are not even EMOPOSITIVE . they say the best way to get rid of EMOPOSITIVE fish is to bring it back to the EMONEGATIVE EMOANTICIPATIONPOSITIVE and to not EMOPOSITIVE EMODISGUSTNEGATIVESADNESS or dead fish . put them in an ice EMODISGUSTNEGATIVESURPRISE . this article was really sad and disturbing to read at the same EMOANTICIPATION .
can you believe how EMOANGERNEGATIVESADNESS some people are ? i just read an article about a woman whose parents EMOFEARNEGATIVE her to have EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST with both of them when she was 11 . they did it for money . if you are a parent struggling for money , how in the world does your mind turn to sexually abusing your EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVE for money ? they are EMODISGUSTNEGATIVESADNESS , and 20 years is not enough EMOANTICIPATION for them in EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS . they are the people that are supposed to EMOPOSITIVE her , and they violated her in the worst way . she is very brave for telling her story and for just being a survivor .
i feel like entrepreneurship is the future . apparently they are making it so you can EMONEGATIVE your EMOPOSITIVE and get unemployment benefits . it 's EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST awesome . i EMOSURPRISE they want to EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST people to EMOANTICIPATION EMOPOSITIVESURPRISE businesses on their own in an EMOPOSITIVE to diversify the workforce in the country . EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST EMOPOSITIVE if you ask me .
i am so EMONEGATIVE of EMOFEARNEGATIVE . especially when all it ends in death , murder , rape , etc . what is the point of all that . who benefits from it ? it just makes me sad for all those people . it sure does make me EMOPOSITIVE to live in a country where i do not have to deal with all that . could you imagine waking up every day not EMOPOSITIVE if you 're going to EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS or blow up from a bomb ?
it ’s a EMODISGUSTFEARNEGATIVESADNESS that nevada is going through this . it is a EMOJOYPOSITIVE state . i really feel for the reservations . they have no where to go . they rely on water as a way of life . they have animals that need water . i do n’t really know what can be done . maybe we should address climate EMOFEAR . it is definitely happening .
you have to read this . it 's EMONEGATIVE that people could act so EMODISGUSTNEGATIVE and EMONEGATIVE towards another human being , no matter what happened . if i were in that situation , i 'd be so EMOANGERDISGUSTNEGATIVE and i would want to EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS someone back . it 's hard not to get caught up in the emotion of the situation since so many people got EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS .
i know that the affordable care act will effect a lot of people out there who are already struggling but this is an issue that just sounds EMONEGATIVE to me . first because so many women that i know who have gotten and iud had complications and second because the issue of women being able to choose to have an EMODISGUSTFEARNEGATIVESADNESS is a bitter conversation to me .
i just read an article regarding a severe EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS in the chicago area with the EMOTRUST that their EMOANTICIPATIONPOSITIVE water EMOPOSITIVE has high amounts of EMOPOSITIVE traces . just what i need , another worldly EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS to EMONEGATIVE about ? ! article shook me , as the health of not only myself but my children is of the utmost EMOANTICIPATIONPOSITIVE to me . i know , i do n’t live in the chicago area , but the article certainly made me think about the water that i drink every day , and my children drink and then just threw foods that i have cooked and EMOANTICIPATIONPOSITIVETRUST . even my local town has just posted something on the EMOTRUST that they need $ 3.2 million to repair the water mains in the one square - mile town as the water pipes are corroded and near health EMOFEARNEGATIVE . i will be researching this locally . i will also be researching for more info on the EMONEGATIVE
i just read an article about u.s. soldiers being killed in jordan . this is tearing my heart out and i ca n't get the images of what must have happened out of my mind . you know that i was in the EMOFEAR myself and it makes it that much harder on me . i ca n't begin to imagine how the families of these soldiers must feel . from what i read , apparently this was an EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESSSURPRISE and the soldiers were shot when they failed to stop at the checkpoint going into the EMOTRUST . the EMOTRUST was already on alert due to a previous car bomb EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVE . i 'm guessing that they felt they could n't take any chances on it being another car EMOFEARSADNESS and went EMOPOSITIVE and shot at the vehicle . it 's so sad . it 's bad enough that these brave men have to face dangers from the EMOANGERDISGUSTFEARNEGATIVE , but when they get taken down by EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST EMOFEAR ?
hello EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST , how have you been lately ? , i have some EMOANTICIPATIONPOSITIVESURPRISE about an article that i read recently , that helped me a lot , that i realized that the article had a EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS that interested me more , because of the events that were happening in this , for example : that a EMOPOSITIVE published online through the journal current biology revealed that in the period of 25 years , half the size of the amazon , and twice the size of the state of alaska , has been EMONEGATIVESADNESS .
an article that i just read is really EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST disturbing . it speaks of the tremendous droughts in the river areas of bolivia . it 's bad enough because it is just a natural disaster situation , but the EMOTRUST that there was also EMONEGATIVE involved is particularly troubling . the EMOFEARNEGATIVE failed to properly care for the canals . the article also speaks of selling off many of its EMONEGATIVESURPRISE animals . this might become a very serious EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS given the EMOTRUST that some of the animals are EMOFEARNEGATIVE species such as the EMONEGATIVESURPRISE dog . they are also looking at selling off elephants , lions and pythons . even if they do this , how much of the money will ever actually reach its citizens to help them ?
from this article i learned about EMOFEARNEGATIVE of gay rights in uganda . gay rights protesters were rounded up by EMOFEARPOSITIVETRUST and taken away from the resort where they were protesting and of those that attempted to resume protesting at another spot , EMOFEARPOSITIVETRUST escorted them away . gay rights have been struggling in uganda , where EMONEGATIVE is illegal and repressed .
dude , you wo n't believe this . a six - year - old girl EMONEGATIVESADNESS down an elevator shaft and died . the elevator company has to be at EMONEGATIVESADNESS here , but that wo n't bring her back ! i ca n't imagine how her parents must feel , looking at my little EMODISGUSTNEGATIVE and wondering what it would be like if we EMONEGATIVESADNESS him in such a EMOANGERDISGUSTFEARNEGATIVE -- yet preventable -- EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS . i feel so bad for the parents , but i wonder if they could have prevented it somehow , and if so , it would be hard not to EMOANGERDISGUSTNEGATIVE them somewhat for what happened . but that is n't to deflect EMODISGUSTNEGATIVESADNESS over how EMOANGERDISGUSTFEARNEGATIVE they must feel , as no one wants to lose their EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVE in such an EMOANGERDISGUSTNEGATIVE EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS . i hope you pray for the family with me !
hello EMOPOSITIVETRUST i am EMOPOSITIVE the news i am very EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST that you are already in sacrament i am EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST that after EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVE your dream of playing in the nba is a great EMOANTICIPATION for you and you should know how to take EMOPOSITIVE of this great EMOANTICIPATIONPOSITIVE take care of yourself and succeed . i'm really very EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST of you
this story is just sad and i just feel like there should be something that we can do to EMOFEAR killings of EMONEGATIVESURPRISE animals just because they own the earth as well as we do . just because humans are expanding and advancing in EMOPOSITIVE it does not mean that we EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS and we hunt everything that we see . it is heartbreaking .
i think china has a EMOPOSITIVETRUST EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS with safety standards and that 's why they have so many accidents in their various industries . it 's really sad that they place economic EMOPOSITIVE over human lives . if they did implement safety standards , they would n't lose so many lives or potential workers and people that care for children .
the results of the EMOFEAR could have been EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS . i 'm just EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVE nobody died . stuff can always be replaced . burns are the worst since they 're so painful . hopefully these people have some family they can stay with until they 're able to find a new housing situation . that 's great that the firemen were able to get the EMOFEAR under control so quickly .
" to be honest with you , in my opinion , i do not believe russia or syria are peaceful countries . syria has the most EMONEGATIVE and EMOANGERDISGUSTNEGATIVESADNESS EMOFEARNEGATIVE officials in the world , and the EMOTRUST that russia has EMOPOSITIVETRUST them through everything is very disturbing and EMOFEARNEGATIVESURPRISE . i know we all like to think that EMOSURPRISE and putin are in " " bed " " together , but is that really the EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS ? what syria does to its own people goes beyond what EMOANGERNEGATIVE can describe , and how russia can EMOFEARPOSITIVE these actions is almost as EMOPOSITIVE EMOANGERDISGUSTFEARNEGATIVE .

" my amazement with the acts of random humans never ceases . i often EMOPOSITIVE how it is that i , another random human in this mixed up EMOANGERDISGUSTNEGATIVE - hole we call " " planet earth " " , can have EMOPOSITIVE EMOPOSITIVE ( to the EMOPOSITIVETRUST that i wo n't even squash a EMODISGUSTFEARNEGATIVE ) and other people will go out of their way to run over an animal crossing the road . humans can be rather sadistic and EMOANGERDISGUSTFEARNEGATIVE individuals . every single day of my life i hear of some EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS story about someone EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS something to death . "
this is just more violent EMONEGATIVE from the EMOSURPRISE middle east . honestly , i font care any longer . all these people clutching to one EMOTRUST or another ( often just as a mask for their EMOANGERNEGATIVE ) and EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS each other out of tribal EMOANGERNEGATIVE . it hast changed , well , ever . i font EMOANTICIPATIONPOSITIVESURPRISETRUST it to EMOFEAR now . its EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS because people are just EMODISGUSTNEGATIVE , solipsistic apes . i just ca nt care any longer about these idiots . its EMOANGERDISGUSTFEARNEGATIVE and EMONEGATIVE but it 's all so preventable .
EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST , water fears remain year after brazil mine dam disaster — collation , brazil — one year after a dam ruptured and sent a EMOFEAR wave of metal - EMONEGATIVE EMONEGATIVE gushing into one of brazil ’s most EMOPOSITIVETRUST rivers , people who live along the banks wo n’t drink the water and fishermen are EMOFEARNEGATIVE to EMOPOSITIVE their EMOSURPRISE . upward of 10 billion gallons of EMONEGATIVE filled with mining EMODISGUSTNEGATIVE EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS towns in the nov. 5 dam EMOSURPRISE that has been described as the worst environmental disaster in latin america ’s largest country . nineteen people EMONEGATIVESADNESS . across 5,000 acres — about six times the size of new york city ’s central park — the onslaught of EMONEGATIVE crushed thousands of trees and wildlife . in the river , more than 14 tons of fish died , mostly after EMONEGATIVE got stuck in their gills . an EMOPOSITIVE large amount of aquatic plants EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS
it never ceases to EMOSURPRISE me that things like this as still occurring . they want to roll back regulations when things like this happened because there were none and now kids have to EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST the price , but they are kids of color so they font matter . remember this , flint still does not have EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST water years later . the EMOFEARNEGATIVE is EMONEGATIVE and the cancer starts in the oval office and runs through his EMODISGUSTFEARNEGATIVE . its EMOANTICIPATION to get these people out of office and to EMOFEARNEGATIVE the companies and people that have allowed this to happened to the EMOPOSITIVETRUST children of america . we need more regulations not less .
there has been EMOFEARSADNESS over the disputed region of kashmir between pakistan and india . it looks as though there were 13 civilians killed during this latest EMOANGERNEGATIVE . it 's EMODISGUSTNEGATIVESADNESS to see so many EMOPOSITIVETRUST people being killed for no EMOPOSITIVE over this disputed EMOPOSITIVE . already there have been two wars fought between these two countries . i hope they can reach a peaceful settlement but since this has been EMOANTICIPATION for over 70 years i highly EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESSTRUST that this will actually EMOANTICIPATION .
" it was sort of EMONEGATIVESADNESS ironic to see the part in there about " " we do n't think he 'll win " " considering what followed . all of it , EMONEGATIVESADNESS , still rings EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST , day after day . there 's been no EMOPOSITIVE , only a doubling down on the EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST of EMOANGERDISGUSTNEGATIVE , EMONEGATIVE , and EMONEGATIVE that was on display since day one . i feel bad for every woman in the country who has to live with someone like that as their EMOPOSITIVETRUST .

officers EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVE at unarmed EMONEGATIVESADNESS men needs to stop . i know there are some really good cops out there , but the bad ones are the ones EMOPOSITIVE the good ones a bad rep . more officers should be vetted before they go to the EMOPOSITIVE . they need to have better background checks . i EMOPOSITIVE understand if someone was EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVEPOSITIVE and the officers were in EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVE of their safety for them to EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVE , but if a EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST EMOPOSITIVETRUST shoots at an unarmed EMONEGATIVESADNESS man for no EMOPOSITIVE , that 's EMONEGATIVE .
it 's absolutely EMOANGERDISGUSTFEARNEGATIVE how indian EMOFEARNEGATIVE treats their people ! poverty , disease , no regulations when it comes to the environmental safety standards . my heart goes out to these people because they deserve to live in EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST on this earth and be EMOPOSITIVE and EMOJOYPOSITIVE just like everyone else . such a EMOANGERDISGUSTNEGATIVE EMONEGATIVE for human life ! india is like hell in earth . i would lock up these EMOFEARNEGATIVE people in solitary EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS for life and let the fly EMONEGATIVE EMONEGATIVE on their heads so they can find out what getting tuberculosis and liver decease is like for these poor people ! the situation in india just never ends , makes you wonder where all these mega wealthy indian royals are ? ! ! ! why is n't the fly EMONEGATIVE EMONEGATIVESADNESS on them , or why are n't they EMONEGATIVE polluted water that causes lung EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS ! ! !
" in my opinion , the girl mentioned in the article is just plain EMONEGATIVE . she should n't be taking selfless in the first place while driving , not only to mention that she was topless just so her boyfriend could get a look at " " the EMOPOSITIVE . " " while you 're driving , you should be paying EMOPOSITIVE and not playing on your cell phone because you 're putting the lives of others at EMOANTICIPATIONFEARNEGATIVE . "
this is sad on the surface , that these two passed away while scuba diving at such an old age , but then i consider it . these two people - lived their life together - went somewhere glorious and had a EMOJOYPOSITIVESURPRISETRUST EMOANTICIPATION on EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVE together before passing . it is EMONEGATIVESADNESS , yes , but is it not also somewhat EMOJOYPOSITIVE ?
there is people EMONEGATIVE and going without any EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST . some of these people used to have jobs and ate well before they EMONEGATIVESADNESS on bad times . they are EMODISGUSTFEARNEGATIVESADNESS and going without basic necessities . one mother went as far as trying to EMODISGUSTNEGATIVE grass for her children to EMOPOSITIVE . i ca nt imagine EMONEGATIVE so much nutrition and EMODISGUSTFEARNEGATIVESADNESS so bad
i EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST of felt a little EMOANGERDISGUSTNEGATIVE EMOPOSITIVE this article . i felt as EMOANTICIPATION this may have been something that was preventable with better infrastructure in place or procedures to check water EMOPOSITIVE for such EMODISGUSTFEARNEGATIVESADNESS . many people EMONEGATIVESADNESS their lives or ended up , maybe it was passed through their family . it would be EMOANGERDISGUSTFEARNEGATIVE to lose someone that you care about like this .
hey i just wanted you know that i read something disturbing this morning in an article . there were bombings and people were killed over fuel . this is EMOFEARNEGATIVESURPRISE and out of control . i 'm feeling so many emotions right now . from EMOANGERNEGATIVESADNESS to EMOANGERDISGUSTNEGATIVE . i do n't understand how people can blow other people up over something so trivial and EMONEGATIVE . they were just EMONEGATIVESADNESS fuel !
it 's EMOANGERDISGUSTNEGATIVE that those EMOPOSITIVE shows of daytime tv moved on to be more like soap opera 's . they could have done a lot of good for their fans , but then it just became more of a EMONEGATIVE EMOJOYPOSITIVESURPRISE . the people that EMONEGATIVESADNESS their jobs on EMOSURPRISE jesse raphael had families they EMOPOSITIVE . after being told the EMOTRUST would be renewed , it was a harsh blow to find out that was n't the EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS . i feel for those that were put out of work .
how EMODISGUSTNEGATIVESADNESS is this . a EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVE at busch gardens in florida attacked a flamingo . park staff had to euthanize the bird because of its injuries . it seems the flamingo did some sort of EMOPOSITIVESURPRISE EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST and had become quite well known for it . the guy is being held on bond , charged with animal cruelty . they ought to throw the book at him .
france plans to shut down the EMOFEAR as they call it . this was where they kept illegal immigrants trying to make their way to britain . i certainly feel for anyone looking for a better life and at times wish all countries had open borders as this one is n't so great at times but we do have laws and many immigrants enter other countries legally and i think there needs to be some sort of controls that make the process EMOPOSITIVE to EMOPOSITIVETRUST citizens . i feel for the immigrants but it 's hard to support their actions when they could also do so legally as EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVE to EMOANTICIPATIONFEARNEGATIVETRUST in by way of EMOFEAR in trucks .
" well nothing about this article was EMOANGERANTICIPATIONFEARNEGATIVE to me . i 'm sure it was n't to you either . we 've talked before about how much politicians like to EMONEGATIVE , but there 's very little to back up the whole " " america is the greatest country in the world " " thing . EMOPOSITIVE that south korea has the most patents per people though . "
to EMOTRUST with how it can be done and EMOPOSITIVETRUST with how others are making sure that i 'm not making sure , which of these things are becoming EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS and how it 's not being told with how the private message is n't being shown . i believe that it ca n't be how my EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST is , because it 's just not EMOPOSITIVETRUST and with it being bad , it 's just not really good .
" man , they are ruining the giraffe EMOPOSITIVE of the rothschild giraffe . it EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST of sucks , but what can you do ? all we do as humans is destroy nature anyway , and when it comes right down to it , i 'm EMODISGUSTNEGATIVESADNESS of EMOFEARNEGATIVE about " " this EMOFEARNEGATIVE species , that EMOFEARNEGATIVE species . " " it is near nauseating to hear people continually express concern over things we can not even EMOFEAR . the habitats are going to be EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS , animals are going to EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS - so what ? as humans , we are a EMODISGUSTFEARNEGATIVESADNESS on the earth , but EMOANGERNEGATIVE that is going to EMOFEAR any EMOANTICIPATION soon is silly and EMODISGUSTNEGATIVE - heated . i wish people would stop EMOANGERNEGATIVE to be EMOFEARSADNESS over things that they EMOANTICIPATIONPOSITIVE have almost no EMONEGATIVEPOSITIVE on , anyway . "
i think it is EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS that these employees were put through this at well 's fargo . i have never worked at a EMOTRUST before , but being told to reach a quota , even by the means of doing illegal tasks to EMOJOYPOSITIVE what they needed to do . i ca n't imagine EMOANTICIPATION into EMOPOSITIVE everyday and wondering if i was going to be considered a good or a bad employee . it would infuriate me to have earned a EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVESURPRISE and then be told i can not have it because i am being developed as an employee . i am EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVE they decided to make the EMOFEAR . it sounds better for their employees .

" " i can only feel them now , " " she says tearfully "
i just read on a news paper about a situation in the capital of bangladesh , dhaka about their water situations . they are confronted with a very EMONEGATIVE water EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS that is quickly turning extremely serious . the capital city has a EMOPOSITIVE of 15 million . they are pumping the water from the city from the underground and the water is dropping with 9 feet every year . my EMOPOSITIVETRUST is that the water is becoming less EMOPOSITIVE as the pumping is going deeper being EMODISGUSTFEARNEGATIVESADNESS with EMODISGUSTFEARNEGATIVESADNESS . the researchers are trying to locate the EMODISGUSTFEARNEGATIVESADNESS areas and in the meantime thinking of different sources of water such as the one with the help of EMONEGATIVESADNESS . they do have serious problems over there and sounds EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST EMOFEAR to have it EMOTRUST . many will have to EMONEGATIVE unfortunately in the meantime
wow EMOPOSITIVE about EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS . i know the situation in africa was bad , but i just always feel it never gets better . you told me that you 're visiting in a few weeks . can you ensure me that you will be okay ? i am EMONEGATIVESADNESS about you and want to maker sure you 're okay . hopefully your EMOPOSITIVE work will yield good results . maybe i will read about you in an article in a few months helping over all . anyways , i hope this reaches you .
why are there so many issues between the middle eastern countries and the EMOPOSITIVETRUST states ? there needs to be world EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST and each EMOTRUST should stop trying to be the powerful dog here . i wish everyone could just get along and we would n't have to EMODISGUSTNEGATIVE so much EMOANTICIPATION with these political affairs . so many people EMONEGATIVESADNESS lives over EMONEGATIVE .
thinking about air conditions in other countries i wonder if other countries who have the capability can help out . the article i read was about air quality and i wondered if it 's hard to EMOJOYPOSITIVESURPRISETRUST indian citizens the affects of what they are doing . maybe teaching them in EMOTRUST would help . it seems many people are EMODISGUSTFEARNEGATIVESADNESS and changing for the better would EMOPOSITIVE a lot of people . i EMOSURPRISE us caring about those would also be EMOPOSITIVE to us because we all EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST the same planet .
having traveled through afghanistan in the mid-1970s and having had a son deployed in afghanistan during the us EMOFEARNEGATIVE , i can tell you that the country is profoundly EMONEGATIVE and EMONEGATIVE even at the best of times . this influx of refugees will cause EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS on a massive scale . the usa should help . if we are willing to invade and EMOPOSITIVE to the destabilization of the country in our own interests , we should also be willing to come in as a magnanimous gesture and help out these poor people in the EMOANTICIPATION of their need .
as we all know , there has been much media on EMOFEARPOSITIVETRUST EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVE . there are many EMOFEARPOSITIVETRUST officers that believe they are above the EMOTRUST , and the common citizens does n't have any rights when they are interacting with them . unfortunately , it 's very sad to say , that even if a EMOPOSITIVE is EMOPOSITIVETRUST , if they do n't EMOPOSITIVE to the fullest , the EMOFEARPOSITIVETRUST can physically EMOFEARNEGATIVE them , even possibly EMOPOSITIVE to being shot and killed . this is very scary ! so , while i do n't believe all officers are like this , one is too many !
it can be a hard experience to go through , but i feel that this was a good article about the conditions of haiti . it 's not in a very good state and has gone through some EMONEGATIVESADNESS trials . the people are in need of support , EMOPOSITIVE , EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST , hope , and EMOPOSITIVETRUST . the writing was very EMOPOSITIVE of what has happened and may come in the future . i think you 'd find this EMOPOSITIVE to read .
i read an EMOPOSITIVE article online about russia again . apparently one of putin former aids had just died outside of a hotel in d.c. , that is really EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS and scary . apparently a lot of people are thinking that this could be EMOANGERDISGUSTFEARNEGATIVE play and it would n't be a surprise since the russian EMOFEARNEGATIVE is known for doing this sort of thing all the EMOANTICIPATION . he was apparently fixing to cut a deal with the federal EMOFEARNEGATIVE which would have angered the russian EMOFEARNEGATIVE so i bet they killed him off so that they could EMOFEARNEGATIVE him EMOPOSITIVE away EMOPOSITIVE to the federal EMOFEARNEGATIVE .
it 's hard to believe that they would go through with this , but they probably want economic EMOPOSITIVE and that will need EMOPOSITIVE EMOANTICIPATION runways . the residents are understandably EMOANGERNEGATIVESADNESS because they will lose their homes , but will likely be compensated . i do think that politicians that said they would vote against expansion and then EMOFEAR their minds , should be voted out .
i fol this article it has a variety teaching about science that banana is the world 's most popular fruit crop , with over 100 million metric tons produced annually in over 130 tropical and subtropical countries in like a 1950s they used to EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST banana this causes disease gets harder to control over EMOANTICIPATION all this is done by EMOPOSITIVETRUST of plant pathology at the EMOANTICIPATIONPOSITIVE of california , davis
just because someone happens to be a celebrity does n't mean that their EMODISGUSTFEARNEGATIVESADNESS is any less valid than the average person 's . we should EMOPOSITIVE to recognize that as a society , we must come to understand the universal nature of EMODISGUSTFEARNEGATIVESADNESS as applicable to all people . one 's EMOPOSITIVE in life should not EMONEGATIVESADNESSSURPRISE them any more open to EMODISGUSTFEARNEGATIVESADNESS than others .
i hate isis . they are a group EMOPOSITIVE of hate and insanity . there is no EMOPOSITIVE for them to be doing the things they do . they make people EMONEGATIVE and EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS for no EMOPOSITIVE at all . they think they are better than other people and should be disbanded . i do not think there is room in this world for people that EMOPOSITIVETRUST with them and they are highly EMODISGUSTNEGATIVE . i can not EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST them at all .
this story makes me EMODISGUSTNEGATIVESADNESS to my EMODISGUST . i hate EMOPOSITIVE things about where my EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST comes from . it 's bad enough to know that i am eating an animal but to know it suffered makes it EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS . while the story is about the the EMODISGUSTFEARNEGATIVESADNESS of an animal at the end of it 's life it seems to EMONEGATIVE the EMODISGUSTFEARNEGATIVESADNESS that the EMOFEAR goes through 99.9 % of the EMOANTICIPATION it is EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST . this EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST of story makes me want to go vegan .
wow . i can imagine being in that man 's shoes . it sounds as if his son could have been more EMOANGERNEGATIVESADNESS than originally EMOANTICIPATION at the other EMONEGATIVE . i would be devastated if i felt so threatened by my own EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVE that i had to resort to EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS . i mean , how terrible it must be ! though details are n't EMOPOSITIVE clear , it sounds as if the son had some issues that were n't EMOPOSITIVE dealt with and it resulted in some sort of confrontation with his dad . how terrible to have to carry this with him the EMOPOSITIVE of forever . it would EMOSURPRISE my heart in two . i hope he gets deep counseling for his EMONEGATIVESADNESS and EMODISGUSTNEGATIVESADNESS . perhaps if the son had , it would n't have happened . more 's the EMOSADNESS .
so the fbi seems to fail at preventing serious terrorist attacks when they knowingly had a EMOFEARNEGATIVE . their investigations obviously are not thorough enough to always EMOFEAR attacks even whey they are EMOANTICIPATIONFEARNEGATIVE about a specific person . the nightclub EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVE in orlando seems like it could have been prevented if the fbi did their EMOPOSITIVE . they had warnings from the killers family and basically a EMOFEAR from the terrorist himself . with extremist like this guy , when they already had him once , i think more severe EMOFEARTRUST are necessary to EMOPOSITIVE the country and its citizens . i feel like the fbi is just making excuses because they were EMOANGERNEGATIVESADNESS and do not seem to take everything as serious as they need too . our country deserves that !
it is sad that this is what is needed to get some people to EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST EMOPOSITIVE to the EMOPOSITIVE EMOANGERDISGUSTNEGATIVESADNESS that has been and is continuing to be done by global warming . something should not have to affect you in order for it to matter . there are things that are a lot more EMOPOSITIVETRUST than your coffee fix . for instance , the people - like the people in the story - whose livelihoods are being put in EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS because of global warming .
a 6.4 magnitude on the richter scale earthquake has shaken up the whole capital of santiago , chile . chile is very propensity to earthquakes and natural disasters . we have heard of an earthquake that scaled out to be 8.8 and EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS over 200 thousand homes in chile . i feel very bad for the people who died . and send out my EMOFEARPOSITIVE to the family of the 55 dead in this earthquake .
when i read this article , to be honest , i do not have any feeling because i am not a fan of all these artists . i do listen to EMONEGATIVESURPRISE songs , but i am not interested in this copyright issues . i would say that EMONEGATIVE right is an EMOPOSITIVETRUST part for people to EMOFEARTRUST because it is a EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST to the EMOPOSITIVE and EMOPOSITIVETRUST .
i just read an article about women encouraging other women to get id 's before EMOSURPRISE took office . they were EMONEGATIVESADNESS that EMOSURPRISE in office will EMONEGATIVESADNESS EMOANTICIPATIONFEARNEGATIVE 's access to affordable birth control . they think because the iud can last for so EMOANTICIPATION that women should get them in soon . i do n't think these women need to be out getting id 's , there are other ways to EMOFEAR EMODISGUSTNEGATIVE . if they are really EMOFEARSADNESS , condoms work well .
i EMOANTICIPATION this was a EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST EMOPOSITIVE article . i learned some things about moldovan EMOANGER . it might be EMOPOSITIVETRUST to some of what you and i were talking about some EMOANTICIPATION ago . in any EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS , it has some new EMOPOSITIVETRUST that have come to light , as it were , new EMOPOSITIVE or opinions that i had not EMOPOSITIVETRUST considered prior to EMOPOSITIVE this article .
hey , did you know that turtles are especially EMOFEARNEGATIVE because of people using them for EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST , exploiting them by selling and trading them , and they are dying because of EMODISGUSTNEGATIVE and EMOANGERDISGUSTNEGATIVESADNESS to rivers and lakes .. their EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST and dwindling . the EMOPOSITIVETRUST EMOANTICIPATIONFEARNEGATIVESADNESS is n't so much the EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS with global warming .. they can stand that somewhat .. the EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS is we are damaging the planet and fresh water so rapidly they can not EMOANTICIPATIONFEARPOSITIVE it . more than 60 percent of turtles and their shelled brothers are in EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS .. they are vulnerable , EMOFEARNEGATIVE , or critically EMOFEARNEGATIVE . we should do something to stop this . these creatures sometimes live longer than us . how is it that we are allowing them to be maimed , eaten , and polluting their EMOPOSITIVE ? ? we have to do better . what do you say we volunteer tog
it 's terrifying to think that EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS is becoming more common in EMOPOSITIVE and EMOPOSITIVE children . i can believe that it happens with teenagers , but it 's starting to become more common in children and preteens too . i ca n't imagine the EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS you would feel to lose a EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVESURPRISE EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVE to EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS . i ca n't imagine how you would move on from that .
" the EMOPOSITIVETRUST whose car had been EMOANGERNEGATIVE approached ms ryder to find she had an " " unclasped brassiere " " and was trying to put on her blouse , EMOFEARPOSITIVETRUST said . the freshman told the EMOPOSITIVETRUST that she had been driving back to her residence on campus . the arresting EMOPOSITIVETRUST wrote in an affidavit : " " i asked her why she was not dressed while driving and she stated she was taking a snap chat photo to send to her boyfriend while she was at a red light . ""she was arrested on EMOFEARNEGATIVE of driving while EMODISGUSTNEGATIVE and released from EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS on thursday morning on a $ 2,000 ( £ 1,600 ) bail bond , EMOFEARPOSITIVETRUST said . "
there is no way the fbi or any EMOFEARNEGATIVE agency could figure out what a EMOSADNESS wolf terrorist was going to do . some terrorist could walk into anywhere and just EMOANTICIPATION EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVE the place up . it 's terrible what the EMOPOSITIVETRUST states has become . the only way i see to limit terrorism is to try and limit immigration into the country , but even that does n't solve things . seems like if you do n't live the right EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST of life to someone , whether it 's being gay etc . , then somebody tries to EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS you . it 's terrible .
to all those with family members deployed in iraq : god EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST your EMOFEAR members who are currently trying to free mosul from isis control . may they rescue and help those poor civilians that isis has taken as human shields . may both the us and iraqi troops and those being held EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS be kept EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST .
just one week after michael bubbly and wife luisa autopilot announced that their 3 - year - old son , noah , has cancer , bubbly ’s EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST and EMOPOSITIVETRUST david foster gave an update on how the singer is coping . i think michael , right now , is in a huge bubble , as you would EMOANTICIPATIONPOSITIVESURPRISETRUST when this happens . everything shuts down around you , ” the EMOPOSITIVE told entertainment tonight canada later adding that bubbly will not sing again until his EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVE is well . i’m certain of it he said many fans have reached out to the singer through social media , and foster said that a few have contacted him wishing to EMOPOSITIVE their well - wishes and EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST to bubbly . though the EMOANTICIPATIONFEARNEGATIVETRUST is heartbreaking , bubbly is “ in good EMOPOSITIVE .
there has been a lot of fires that are happening in the south . many people are being told that they have to EMONEGATIVETRUST EMOJOYPOSITIVE masks if they want to go outside because of the smoke from the fires . people are also investigating to see what really caused the EMOFEAR many people are suspecting that it 's EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVE that is causing a lot of these fires to EMOANTICIPATION . a lot of organizations are asking people to donate water and drinks for the firefighters to quench their thirst while EMOANGERNEGATIVE fires . it truly is a sad thing and hopefully this EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS will be resolved sooner than later .
ugh , another example of crappy cops . they think they can get anyway with anything . i 've started to EMOPOSITIVE out my phone camera whenever i see the cops talking to someone , especially if they are a EMONEGATIVE . EMOFEARPOSITIVETRUST EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVE is such a EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS in our country and it 's just so deeply ingrained in the EMOTRUST , i 'm not sure what can be done . we need some EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST of overhaul of the EMOANGERDISGUSTFEARNEGATIVE EMOPOSITIVETRUST EMOTRUST .
why am i so EMODISGUSTNEGATIVE when it comes to EMOANGER . i just reread an article 3 times over to try and figure out what it was talking about with EMOSURPRISE and jobs and discrimination and racism by the end of it all three times i felt like i had read EMOANGERNEGATIVE . is that how EMOANGER are for you or do you actually understand it . all i understand is that i do n't EMOPOSITIVE with EMOSURPRISE i do n't EMOPOSITIVE with his antics i do n't EMOPOSITIVE with his policies . i 'm not sure if he 's EMOANGERDISGUSTNEGATIVE or just a EMONEGATIVE right now . how do you feel ?
the article that i read was about these architects that are EMOPOSITIVE things and they are EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST of looking at the EMOFEARTRUST for buildings and their tools that are used to EMOPOSITIVE the buildings . they want to see what will be safer and allow the people to make better buildings . there was a recent mishap that caused several people to EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS and it was EMOTRUST to the EMOPOSITIVE issues .
what a terrible EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS ! accidents like this EMOANGERNEGATIVE families so hard ... and EMOANGERNEGATIVESADNESS both a EMOTRUST and son this way ! the poor family must be just beside themselves . it seems too , if one looks at the circumstances , that they were close and enjoyed doing things together . how very sad . the EMOPOSITIVE of the family must be just shaken to the EMOPOSITIVE . hopefully they are a tight knit group with support systems . i hate to hear about anyone in accidents , but this sort of thing is just too sad .
did you hear about the wolf that got shot by a EMOFEARNEGATIVE sniper in idaho i think it was . he was a EMOJOYPOSITIVE wolf from a pack in california that was EMOFEARNEGATIVE and had a tracking device on him so they could monitor his movements . he had already traveled 700 miles looking for a EMOPOSITIVETRUST , which is what wolves do when they come of age . they are trying to hold them EMOPOSITIVETRUST for the needless and cruel slaughter of EMONEGATIVESURPRISE animals . i forgot the name of the group . but i hope they stop them . animals need more laws that EMOPOSITIVE them from evil EMODISGUSTNEGATIVE people .
" i 'd like to say that a comedy of errors has taken place . it seems our EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST gil got himself into trouble without doing anything EMONEGATIVE . his identity was EMOANGERNEGATIVE and then later he was mistakenly identified as the EMONEGATIVE person . society needs to do a better EMOPOSITIVE of EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST enough EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST for the " " EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVE " " to ensure that the perpetrator does n't get a free ride while the EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVE seems to lose everything . we do live in a society where supposedly you are EMOPOSITIVETRUST till EMOTRUST EMOANGERNEGATIVESADNESS , right ? how can one lose a drivers license and a EMOPOSITIVE without 100 % EMOTRUST on the table ? EMOPOSITIVE should be brought to EMOANGERFEAR to ensure that everyone is held harmless till all the EMOPOSITIVETRUST are in . is this achievable in our EMOANTICIPATION ? i believe yes if the right companies and EMOFEARNEGATIVE EMOPOSITIVE are brought in early enough . "
this took place close to where i live so i can honestly say that it alarms me . its a EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVE world where this can EMOANTICIPATION and its always sad . i noticed the EMOFEARPOSITIVETRUST and courts could have been more involved in preventing this but thatch just how many of the violent stories i 've been EMOFEARNEGATIVE have gone recently .
imagine the EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVESURPRISE of going to a concert and the buildup for days after buying tickets . imagine that you finally get to see these bands play and all of the EMOSURPRISE you hear gunshots ring out . you see people EMONEGATIVESADNESS down , dead . how are you supposed to cope with that ? how can you get up the next day and feel that this is a world EMOPOSITIVE living in ?
drunk driver i ’m guessing . it is EMOANGERDISGUSTFEARNEGATIVE . i hope he rots in EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS . i have no EMOPOSITIVESADNESS for drunk drivers . it ’s not EMOPOSITIVE that he gets to live . he took the lives of a mother and her children . i ca n’t imagine what i would do if that happened to my family . life is so EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVESURPRISE . it can be taken away so fast and so EMOSURPRISE .
everything from the smoking dangers posed to children , to the epidemic of rats and their EMODISGUSTNEGATIVE products , to even EMOSADNESS crises surrounding greece - are all problematic situations . these situations have to each be approached from a different perspective , and because of this - they require a more focused and specialized touch .
i feel that these muslim areas are in dire need of help . i feel so very sad and alarmed for them , as i know the citizens are EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS and do n't know who to turn to for help . it ca n't be easy to live in an area where you never know if you will wake up to your village being raided , your women being raped and EMOANTICIPATIONFEARNEGATIVESADNESS of your EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVE being dragged into EMOFEAR or political rebels groups . many people in america do not realize how much EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST , safety and EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST we have by living in this country , as we have never EMOPOSITIVETRUST the EMOANTICIPATIONFEARNEGATIVESADNESS that people in these muslim countries experience . i 'm sure many live in EMOFEARNEGATIVE and EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVE of the EMOANTICIPATIONFEARNEGATIVE , of what could be , and actually the reality of their life . there are many poor villages and citizens , so they do n't have options to find a way out of there .
apparently the EMOFEAR albatross is being EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS by EMOFEAR mice that have overrun one of their EMOPOSITIVE breeding islands . i do n't exactly understand how , but the parents have n't learned that the mice are a EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVE and just sit there and EMOANTICIPATIONFEAR them EMOPOSITIVE the babies . seeing as how they are meat eaters you 'd think the mice would EMOPOSITIVETRUST an easy snack .
i just read a very sad article about a man who recently lose his family from a car EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESSSURPRISE . the car was EMOANGERNEGATIVE by someone who EMONEGATIVESADNESS control while speeding and slammed into the car with the family , causing all of them to EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS . the person speeding , along with his family were also killed . it 's so sad and troubling EMOPOSITIVE that someone has to go through such tragedies in life due to other peoples careless mistakes . may god EMOPOSITIVE their poor souls .
while the article seems to be slightly sympathetic to the inmates , i say no way . i do n't particularly care what happens to most prisoners , let alone the violent ones that EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVE each other and guards . there is no EMOPOSITIVE why any EMOFEARPOSITIVETRUST should ever have to put themselves in EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS . these are n't people , these are violent animals , and the guards should be EMOTRUST . they are n't the ones being punished for what is likely a severe EMOANGERDISGUSTNEGATIVESADNESS . restraints , solitary , whatever it takes , i do n't feel one tiny twinge of EMONEGATIVESADNESSTRUST . and lawsuits ? do n't even get me started on that one !
what i learned from my experience is that most modern factories , even the ones in thirds world countries , will try to make their employees reasonably comfortable and EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST . not because their super - altruistic but because it helps with EMOPOSITIVE . a EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST , rested , relaxed worker does better work and more of it than an EMONEGATIVESADNESS , stressed out one . it 's EMONEGATIVESADNESS that this guy died the way they did ono the EMOPOSITIVE like that .
i saw this news item about a EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVE in north philly . is this near where you live ? EMOANGERDISGUSTNEGATIVE , i am so EMODISGUSTNEGATIVESADNESS of EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVE EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS . will it ever end ? every day , it seems to be something new . here in detroit , we see it all the EMOANTICIPATION and i know you 're in a similar situation in philadelphia . the article does n't give any details about the victims or anything like that . it almost dehumanizes people , do n't you think ? i mean , these victims were somebody 's relatives . hopefully more details will come out in future articles . the news media cares more about being the first to report a story instead of sticking around to find out the details . i know i am EMONEGATIVE here . but all this EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVE EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS is too much .
as i was EMOPOSITIVE our local newspaper last night , my eyes came to EMOPOSITIVE on several reports of yet another handful of the EMOANTICIPATION attacks and -murders south africa has become known for over the past years . EMOANTICIPATION attacks and -murders which see journalists having to write these reports with EMOANGERNEGATIVE i can not even begin to imagine the sickening feeling of . EMOANGERNEGATIVE like “ boiling water poured down 87 - year - old farmer ’s throat for hours on end , ” and “ his wife and two teenage daughters were tied with barbed wire in the bathroom , after which they were repeatedly raped , burned with a EMOANGER EMOPOSITIVETRUST , and stabbed with a sharp object . ”
" i just read an article about the hate and racism in america since donald EMOSURPRISE won the election . it talked about " " countless acts of hate " " EMONEGATIVE from day one of trumps presidency . i EMOANTICIPATION the article was EMOANGERDISGUSTNEGATIVE . you can not EMOANGERDISGUSTNEGATIVE already existing problems on a newly elected EMOTRUST . there was no EMOPOSITIVETRUST or statistics EMOPOSITIVETRUST the claims made in the article . "
read an EMOPOSITIVE article about EMODISGUSTFEARNEGATIVESADNESS in the forests you might EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST . so EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST , you just have to live to EMOPOSITIVE with things . EMOFEAR is certain . it 's the one EMOPOSITIVETRUST on the planet as in life . check it out , it 's sort of sad EMOTRUST of reality but as EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST as can be . EMOFEAR is gon na come regardless of what you do and regardless of if you want it to or not .
it is frightening to EMOPOSITIVE about all these EMONEGATIVE attacks but these surfers should be aware of the risks associated with the sport . relocating the sharks should be a priority and it would be in the best EMOPOSITIVE to EMOTRUST a moratorium on water sports until the EMONEGATIVE epidemic is dealt with . closing EMOJOY in australia is a good precautionary method
i really liked this guys EMOJOYPOSITIVESADNESS . it 's hard to feel too sad though . he lived a EMOPOSITIVE and EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST life . his EMOJOYPOSITIVESADNESS will live on for generations and there is every bit of the EMOSURPRISE that he will never be EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS . it is not bad to live to 80 . many others live far shorter lives and some peoples EMOPOSITIVE seems as EMONEGATIVESADNESS as a fart in the wind .
like i have said before and will say it till i am EMOSADNESS in the face . i hate donald EMOSURPRISE . he is not progressing the EMOPOSITIVETRUST states of america EMOPOSITIVE . he says his new slogan is keep america great , well , EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST , you got to make it great in the first place . he is one racist , misogynistic , EMODISGUSTNEGATIVE EMODISGUSTNEGATIVE and can not EMOANTICIPATIONNEGATIVE till he EMONEGATIVESADNESSSURPRISE , however way .
these type of events of bomb explosions and terrorist threats are extremely EMOFEARNEGATIVE and should be taken very seriously . people are just going around for their day and they do n't really know what could EMOANTICIPATION to them and these type of incidents are very EMONEGATIVE and hurtful . the security measures in the EMOPOSITIVETRUST states should be more EMOPOSITIVE and should check anyone that is EMOANGERANTICIPATIONNEGATIVE and make the country a safer place than how it already is .
a EMOFEARNEGATIVE is about to EMOANGERNEGATIVE taiwan soon . it 's supposed to be really big , the biggest since 1969 . we just had some really awful hurricanes in the west too . the ones here were caused by global warming , so i wonder if china 's are too ? it 's EMOANGERDISGUSTFEARNEGATIVE that so many people will lose their homes or their lives just so rich executives can make a few bucks more .
this will not end well . people have to EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST their own country . taking a shortcut by moving to a better country will just EMOANTICIPATION in the host country EMODISGUSTFEARNEGATIVESADNESS . the best citizens will work hard to EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST their country . they will not give up and EMONEGATIVESADNESSSURPRISE . lots of blood was EMONEGATIVE in many of the countries that migrants EMOANTICIPATION to live in .
hey , i wonder if this EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESSSURPRISE is EMOTRUST to terrorism . i bet it was . seems like big accidents nowadays has something to do with terrorism . you got any family from delaware ? i do n't . there is one thing i know , that i do n't want to EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS in a vehicle EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESSSURPRISE . that has to be terrible . i EMOSURPRISE if it 's instant death then it 's okay . i just do n't want to EMONEGATIVE for a EMOANTICIPATION EMOANTICIPATION . i hope the people taken to the hospital are okay .
i just read this really EMOANTICIPATION article about a EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST man that actually got sentenced after EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVE a EMONEGATIVESADNESS teenager dead . i ca n't help but feel incredibly EMOJOYPOSITIVE after EMOPOSITIVE this . it happens way too much in this country where EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST people are able to get away with EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS EMONEGATIVESADNESS people . this EMOANTICIPATION , it finally feels like some EMOPOSITIVETRUST has been done .
the EMOPOSITIVETRUST states should be EMODISGUSTNEGATIVESADNESS of how this last election went . it was sad that they could not be EMOPOSITIVE to other countries in the EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVE . EMOSURPRISE bullied other countries and the other bullies in the us voter for him . there is no EMOPOSITIVE why such a EMODISGUSTNEGATIVE should be running our country . i know as americans anyone can become EMOPOSITIVETRUST , but that does not mean that they do not have to be presidential material .
wow , it is EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST sad to see a EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST family be devastated by a preventable cause . i send my prayers out to whomever was in immediate relations with the family . this makes me be more EMOPOSITIVE for everyday life because i really do n't know when my last day will be . i hope the EMOFEAR department workers are emotionally well , because i know it can be distressful to see these things EMOANTICIPATION
those poor boys . they never asked for any of this . their EMOTRUST be a died beat dad and EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS them . what a EMOPOSITIVE EMOANGERDISGUSTNEGATIVE to scared EMOANGERSURPRISE . the boys were so EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVESURPRISE and EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS with a dead beat dad . the man should of just killed himself and left those 2 boys out of it . what did he EMOJOYPOSITIVE by EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS his sons ? i have no EMOANGERNEGATIVE to describe how much EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS those 2 little ones were probably in . its EMODISGUSTFEARNEGATIVESADNESS when kids have to take EMONEGATIVESADNESS for their parents misfortunes . and that mother . the heart EMONEGATIVESADNESS she will have to face of EMOANGERNEGATIVESADNESS not only 1 son but 2 . i can not imagine the EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS that would cause .
can you believe this happened ? ugh . how scary ! i realize that people can be EMOANGERDISGUSTNEGATIVE with each other , but pushing someone in front of a train ? ? ? it is amazing to me that people are so out of control that they ca n't even handle a verbal EMOANGERNEGATIVE with someone . its easy , just walk away ! i EMOSURPRISE i should stay away from the train platform
" michael moore to democrats : i told you EMOSURPRISE was going to win — on wednesday , filmmaker and activist michael moore penned a " " morning after to - do list " " for democrats that has , as of thursday morning , been shared more than 180,000 times , liked more than 350,000 times , and commented on more than 18,000 times . moore also says democrats must EMOFEAR the pundits , pollsters , and members of the media who EMONEGATIVESADNESS to let go of a narrative about the election that proved to be EMONEGATIVE , EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVE aside any democratic members of congress who are n't EMOANTICIPATION to EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVE , and remind everyone they meet that hillary clinton won the popular vote . his no . 4 item , however , might come as a surprise to democrats who are posting their own EMOPOSITIVE updates on social media about how " " shocked " " or " " EMOFEARNEGATIVESURPRISE " " they are at this EMOANTICIPATIONPOSITIVE "
i think that its really sad that forests are getting wiped out through causes of diseases and invasive species of bugs . it really should be are EMOPOSITIVE priority as humans to EMOPOSITIVE the environment the earth has provided to us before its to EMONEGATIVESADNESS . it up to us as the EMOPOSITIVE generation to reverse decades of environmental abuse so that future generations are able to EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST nature such as hiking through a EMOJOYPOSITIVE forest .
this article here was a bit confusing and i really could n't see the point . from what i gathered a EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS from ohio is trying to EMOFEARPOSITIVE its ' people from an EMOANGERNEGATIVE federal EMOFEARNEGATIVE . i can EMOPOSITIVE understand why they would want to stand up to the federal EMOFEARNEGATIVE . apparently , a protester was shot by the EMOFEARNEGATIVE . i seen nothing in the article that explained the protester was violent or a EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS to the ones around him . just shot for protesting . this is an EMOANGERDISGUSTNEGATIVE !
if this was a hate EMOANGERNEGATIVE that really sucks . if this was just a bar EMOANGERDISGUSTFEARNEGATIVE that ended very EMONEGATIVESADNESS ... still sucks . i do n't understand why the EMOFEARPOSITIVETRUST are being so EMONEGATIVE about things . and this guy 's family is clear on the other side of the world probably feeling EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS . the other minorities in the area deserve to know if they need to be EMONEGATIVESADNESS . please , cops , release some info .
i am crushed after EMOFEARNEGATIVE about the conditions in haiti after EMOFEARNEGATIVE matthew EMOANGERNEGATIVE the area . the people are literally EMONEGATIVE to death and the EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS and EMODISGUSTNEGATIVESADNESS do not have access to enough , if any EMOANTICIPATIONFEARPOSITIVETRUST care . there are areas that are EMOPOSITIVE EMONEGATIVE to EMOPOSITIVE , either medically or EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST or water EMOPOSITIVE . there is EMOPOSITIVE looting in haiti and the situation is extremely EMOFEARNEGATIVE even for those that try to bring in EMOPOSITIVE to the people living there . my heart is breaking as i think of all the people , children and adults in haiti . it is a country that still has not recovered from the earthquake that happened there years before . i think that our country should EMOANTICIPATIONPOSITIVETRUST to report on these terrible conditions and try to get EMOPOSITIVE to haiti from every source available .
i think there is enough EMOPOSITIVE about the health hazards of smoking for it to be understood why it should be outlawed in most EMOANTICIPATIONPOSITIVE places . it is something that should be done in the privacy of people 's homes , right ? it makes EMOPOSITIVE to me . as for the EMOPOSITIVE of the EMOPOSITIVE here about EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST safety , i do n't EMOTRUST most any EMOANTICIPATIONPOSITIVE EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST establishment . i 've seen too many nasty kitchens and bathrooms to EMOTRUST a place to be EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST when it counts !
hi n. just EMONEGATIVESADNESS to EMOPOSITIVE to somebody and you as always you are the right person to reach to . i just read an article on the matthew and the EMOANGERNEGATIVE it left in haiti . i was EMONEGATIVESADNESS and i almost can not believe how many people were affected and not just that but they were EMODISGUSTFEARNEGATIVESADNESS from all kinds of unimaginable things . hunger was the first to list , there was a lot a EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS , people were poring from all over when EMOPOSITIVE was EMOANTICIPATION to bring them EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST EMOPOSITIVE with trucks . disease was everywhere , doctors EMOANTICIPATION from all over the world had to face with EMODISGUSTFEARNEGATIVESADNESS and disease . infrastructure was damaged , homes EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS . it is really hard to express in EMOANGERNEGATIVE all the EMODISGUSTFEARNEGATIVESADNESS the people had to deal with . i feel like there should be something we should do to help .
oh man , i feel perturbed . why do people have to keep EMODISGUSTFEARNEGATIVESADNESS and dying so we can understand that strict EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVE control is necessary , who needs to EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS ? how many people ? this is just a sad and EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS story repeating itself , over and over again . we need to understand that as EMOANTICIPATION as anyone can get a EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVE , nobody is EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST .
is it too much to ask for a judge that follows the constitution ? check this article out and see if you EMOPOSITIVE . focusing on fringe issues is not going to unite us . i wish we could move past this and EMONEGATIVESADNESSSURPRISE people 's EMOTRUST beliefs out of it and EMOPOSITIVE only on the EMOTRUST . that would be nice for a EMOFEAR , would n't it ?
check out this article . remember i was telling you the other day about that man from the EMOTRUST who approached me in the market ? he was asking about my EMOPOSITIVE EMOANTICIPATION and EMOANTICIPATION and short term goals . he also asked about my EMOFEAR . i bet he has the same pressures as the EMOTRUST workers in pennsylvania . so EMOFEARNEGATIVE ! i would never want to work under that EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST of EMONEGATIVE .
i feel like the world is so EMONEGATIVE that it no longer makes me feel anything . i EMOANTICIPATIONPOSITIVESURPRISETRUST the worst from this world and only am EMOSURPRISE when something exceedingly good happens . that is a EMODISGUSTFEARNEGATIVESADNESS that such a EMODISGUSTNEGATIVE scene can not even make me feel anything . the world is a cesspool and we no longer have any EMOPOSITIVETRUST to EMOTRUST for it .
i think this family had more then enough EMOFEAR and notice not to go into that EMOANGER spring area . the EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVESURPRISE man EMONEGATIVESADNESS and scalded himself to death while his sister / EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST sat there and videotaped the whole thing . i font understand some peoples logic . what made them think this was ok ? what made them think they would be ok and what made them thing that parks put boundaries up just because they think its funny .
" it hurts to know that those children may have EMONEGATIVESADNESS their parents in their EMOANGERNEGATIVESURPRISE and that they may be put into the " " EMOTRUST " " where they 're passed around multiple families before they find a EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST home . i wonder if they have relatives that might be willing to take them in . i wish the article had been more informative and told a more EMOPOSITIVE story about what happened and why the children were spared when three adults were killed . perhaps there was a EMOANGERNEGATIVE between the adults involved and the children ended up witnessing a EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS EMOSURPRISE . either way , no good comes out of this entire situation . "
it 's sad to hear about dead fish , but that 's what happens sometimes . we can try to figure out what 's going on and make a EMOANTICIPATION to stop , but nature is going to always come out EMOPOSITIVE no matter what . nature always has its EMOPOSITIVE and you ca n't stop that from happening . if you do EMOANTICIPATION , you 're just going to cause more problems than what it 's EMOPOSITIVE and nature will still EMOFEARTRUST in the end .
hey bud , check this news out . apparently a couple was on a cruise EMOANTICIPATION and the husband EMONEGATIVESADNESS off the EMOANTICIPATION EMONEGATIVESURPRISE . after EMOPOSITIVE the whole article , i believe that the other husband has the right to EMOANGERNEGATIVESADNESS the authorities for not saving the his husband after he EMONEGATIVESADNESS off . in any EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS , whether the person was EMOANGERNEGATIVESADNESS of previous crimes , he or she should be saved or this would have been seen as EMONEGATIVE work by the EMOFEARPOSITIVETRUST officers .
i 'm not so sure that there is any right in this situation , of course it was EMONEGATIVE what he did and he could have handled this another way . he did what he did for his own reasons and he ca n't take that back and he definitely does not feel sorry for what he did . was it so serious just because he is the EMOPOSITIVE and would it not been so serious if he was n't a EMOPOSITIVE ? could he have done something better with the money ? absolutely , so he is n't EMONEGATIVE when he says the money should have been used for other things , but throwing a pie in someones face probably is n't the best way to EMOTRUST it
i just read an article about an infant orangutan , that was so sad . there had been several orangutans rescued from an illegal dealer . they were taken to a rescue EMOPOSITIVETRUST . the infant orangutan all of a EMOSURPRISE collapsed in her EMONEGATIVESADNESS . she has meningitis which can be deadly for her . she is getting amazing care at this EMOPOSITIVETRUST though , so i sure hope she pulls through . i have no EMOPOSITIVE money right now but you can donate to this organization !
if you are using trumps name to make him look bad is not the answer here . i know that EMOSURPRISE is not being a good EMOPOSITIVETRUST right now but lets not EMONEGATIVE his EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVE . somebody burned a EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST that is not EMOTRUST to donald EMOSURPRISE at all , lots of families go to that EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST . i think someone used this EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVE as an EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVE to donald EMOSURPRISE because he is not EMOPOSITIVE with this and makes people look like he caused this
" why were 43 students hijacking buses ? that was n't EMOTRUST in my EMOTRUST . bus high - jacking 101 . they seriously failed . i am rather EMONEGATIVE that is EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST though . if the EMOFEARPOSITIVETRUST are willing to give " " criminals " " over to the drug cartels , i 'm EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST sure they are n't above EMOANGERDISGUSTNEGATIVE about it . one of my coworkers has n't visited her family in years because their state has become so EMOANGERNEGATIVE ridden they wo n't let her come home . they say it is n't EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST for her . how EMONEGATIVE sad is that ? and god EMONEGATIVESADNESS they try to come here to EMOANTICIPATIONFEARNEGATIVEPOSITIVE that EMODISGUSTNEGATIVE . right wing crazies do not have any EMOFEARPOSITIVE for people just trying to live , it seems . "
you hear about the environmental cost of using coal , but it is very upsetting to read about specific people and how their lives have changed , for the EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS , because of coal mining . further upsetting is to hear about the animals effected . elephants invading villages , being electrocuted , EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS humans , all because their EMOPOSITIVE is being taken for coal . sad ! people are dying from EMONEGATIVE of fresh air and water , and it is EMONEGATIVE .
i can not even be EMOSURPRISE by the EMOPOSITIVETRUST of insanity that is going on out there right now . i almost feel as though i am EMONEGATIVE to it . i can no longer be moved by this EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVE because it is something that i can EMOANTICIPATIONPOSITIVESURPRISETRUST because of the mental EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS that is prominent in our society . we can no longer feel EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST that our protection is the priority today .
yeah so global warming is really messing with the polar EMOANGERFEAR and the glaciers , if the earth continues to melt and the glaciers EMOANTICIPATIONPOSITIVETRUST to melt then we could be looking at the extension of the polar EMOANGERFEAR , the disappearance of our glacier and mass ma flooding . luckily they EMOPOSITIVE a lot of people keeping a close eye the EMOPOSITIVE levels and EMOPOSITIVE on how to slow the warming of our planet .
check out this news article . it 's absolutely infuriating that this sort of thing would EMOANTICIPATION yet again , not only from a big oil and gas company , but specifically from bp again . their EMOPOSITIVE EMODISGUSTFEARNEGATIVESADNESS EMOTRUST leads to environmental disasters and someone has to put a stop to their bs before we let them EMOPOSITIVE destroy our EMOPOSITIVE here on earth .
" yo . i hope that you are EMOANTICIPATION to read a EMOANTICIPATION EMONEGATIVE article about things that both did not make a difference in the election and things that enough people decided did not fucking matter . it 's another take on " " look at what an EMOANGERDISGUSTNEGATIVE EMOSURPRISE is " " it 's totally EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST , but nothing changed because of things like this so i do n't see the EMOPOSITIVE of rehashing it . EMOSURPRISE 's a EMOPOSITIVETRUST mother fucker , but he was a EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST man , so enough assholes voted for him . anyway , please EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST yet another EMODISGUSTNEGATIVE article . "
global warming is an issue that has been brewing for some EMOANTICIPATION and seems to be getting EMONEGATIVE in all directions as it is not a grey issue but a EMONEGATIVESADNESS and EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST issue meaning it is either happening or it is not . it is hard to see which side has the more valid EMOANGERNEGATIVE over the other since everyone involved is so EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST about their side of it all .
did you hear that the very first EMOPOSITIVE us EMOANGERFEARPOSITIVETRUST EMOPOSITIVETRUST died recent at 78 . she was put in under clinton though so she was probably very EMONEGATIVE and did a lot of bad things over the course of her EMOANTICIPATIONPOSITIVE . but she went to harvard so she must have been EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST smart regardless . she was also the one who got a little EMODISGUSTNEGATIVE sent back to cuba which is just EMOANGERDISGUSTFEARNEGATIVE since they are living in EMOANGERDISGUSTFEARNEGATIVE conditions with a EMOANGERDISGUSTFEARNEGATIVE EMOFEARNEGATIVE that abuses them .
i just read an article about the awful treatment of animals of zoos in EMONEGATIVE countries from us . feeling a little down thinking of how these people could treat the animals how they could EMOANTICIPATIONPOSITIVETRUST to raise animals in zoos where people will come and view them while they 're ill EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS and some even dying . even after EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVESURPRISE help to get these animals to a better location where they can be cared for properly other zoos are still continuing with bad treatment and allowing visitors to come EMOTRUST it . just like a EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVE animals EMOANTICIPATIONTRUST on us if we have them caged either let them out of the EMONEGATIVESADNESS or take care of them why is that so hard for people to understand or do ?
i hope everyone is ok . i was in a EMONEGATIVE earthquake and it was extremely scary . a lot of people can EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS if you do n't have EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST buildings . i think there should be a EMOPOSITIVE international EMOPOSITIVE to EMOPOSITIVETRUST EMOPOSITIVETRUST for any nations in an earthquake prone region so that we can do a little bit to EMOFEAR more deaths when the earthquakes inevitably EMOANGERNEGATIVE .
this is the type of thing that really scares me . i would be very interested in viewing this video . how in the world does one EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVE their own relatives and two EMOFEARPOSITIVETRUST officers ? what gives this person the right to take someone else life ? those people may have had children , mothers , sisters , friends , co - workers , and now they are dead , and for what ? how did this individual go so EMOANTICIPATION without being apprehended . sometimes the EMOTRUST really confuses me and upsets me . i wish they would have caught him sooner and kept him EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST so he could EMOPOSITIVETRUST his actions .
EMOPOSITIVE the article , i was disgusted EMOPOSITIVE that a EMOTRUST had not only killed himself but took away the lives of his two sons as well . the only EMOPOSITIVE why that man even killed himself was that the EMOFEARPOSITIVETRUST saw him EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS his two children . people in this world today should n't lose their lives due to a EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS / EMOANGERDISGUSTNEGATIVE EMOPOSITIVETRUST .
looks like american apparel is at it again and declaring bankruptcy . ironically they are getting bought out by a canadian company . i feel sorry for the employees , but its hard to feel sorry for the company since they just font seem to get it . i think one EMOSURPRISE is EMOPOSITIVE , but when you have to declare bankruptcy again a year later your EMOPOSITIVETRUST does n't seem to know what they are doing . maybe the company that bought them will finally get it right .
i feel really bad for these orangutans . they must have been treated so bad to be in the condition they are in when they were EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST . those things should never have been bought and trades and put in a domesticated situation . it 's good that they 're being taken care of . hopefully they can recover and go back to where they came from .
here is an article i just read about an EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESSSURPRISE at an EMOJOYPOSITIVE park in australia . i 've never heard of dreamworld , have you ? but the ride sounds like the old EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVE the rapids we used to ride on at cedar point . in this EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS , the boat tipped over and people got trapped in the conveyor EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVE . i ca n't even imagine what the last moment of those people 's lives must have been like . as for the kids who saw it all happen-- there are no EMOANGERNEGATIVE ! at least none of the children died in the EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESSSURPRISE . but now they have EMONEGATIVESADNESS a parent . one of those kids was just a EMOJOYPOSITIVE . now she will never know her mother . i never EMOANTICIPATION about rides failing when we were kids and used to go to EMOJOYPOSITIVE parks , but now i would probably not ride on any of that stuff .
i ca n't believe wells fargo would do this in such a unprofessional manner . repossessing vehicles without going through the EMOPOSITIVE procedures . especially screwing over people who EMOPOSITIVE our country . i hope their fines were huge . they are going to have to do a lot of changing if they want to get the EMOTRUST of their customers back . i for one never EMOANTICIPATION on using them .
i felt extremely bad and EMOANGERDISGUSTFEARNEGATIVE for the EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVE that EMONEGATIVESADNESS down like that . i also felt very sad and EMOANGERNEGATIVESADNESS when they EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST him dead about four days later . the poor EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVE should have been taken care of more and looked after so that nothing would have happened to him then . i think that this whole thing is such a EMOANGERDISGUSTFEARNEGATIVE EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS and that it also could have been prevented as well .
the chicago district has shutdown about twenty five percent of there EMOANTICIPATIONPOSITIVE EMONEGATIVE fountains . they have EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST levels of EMOPOSITIVE that are great in this area . it is EMOTRUST that about one out of seven children have levels of EMOPOSITIVE in their EMOTRUST that the epa deems too high . after the outbreak in flint , i can see for their concerns .
i feel that racism is still EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST today and it is a big EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS people need to realize that color does n't matter and that we are all humans with feeling and no one person is better than the other regardless of the color of there skin . there should be stronger laws helping EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVE racism also teaching kids that its not ok to call people names just cause of there skin color . we need to work as a EMOTRUST to fix this EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS
it 's nice that these cases are critiqued so thoroughly as once an execution has started , there 's no going back . it sounds like he shot his EMOTRUST for sure though . even though he maybe did n't EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS the husband of the woman he had an affair with , one murder should potentially be enough for the death EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS .
this is a sad state of affairs , but what do you EMOANTICIPATIONPOSITIVESURPRISETRUST from a country that is as EMONEGATIVE as russia . the ruling class has a stranglehold on the EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST and the average person gets next to nothing . the country is barely a step above a third world country in most parts , while the rich get richer and putin profits . there is not that much difference now than in the 70 's and 80 's except now the EMODISGUSTNEGATIVE is out in the open and there are billionaires all over the place .
i think if someone is going to take on that responsibility in raising cattle they should at least know what they are doing . this guy , EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST , does not care for them . they hardly have EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST or water . they get no interaction so when they do need to round them up , they 're mean . that should be illegal . i 'm EMOSURPRISE he has not been caught yet . he is very EMOJOYPOSITIVESURPRISE because when he get caught he will EMONEGATIVESADNESS not taking EMOPOSITIVE care of them .
i think this world is EMOPOSITIVE of hate and i do n't understand it . why do they hate us ? why are they EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS EMOPOSITIVETRUST people?and donald EMOSURPRISE is n't going to make anything better . he shows people hate and we might have even more terrorist EMOANTICIPATION to america . america should EMOTRUST people how to EMOJOYPOSITIVE . america acts like the EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS but we have EMONEGATIVESADNESS as well . there is no country that is right or EMONEGATIVE we are all human and we are all imperfect . the only EMOPOSITIVE we should listen to is god . a lot of these presidents and kings of our countries think there god . we should humble ourselves and just EMOJOYPOSITIVE . put ourselves in other peoples shoes .
hey guys check this article out . i was talking to about this sleep paralysis thing . it 's such a scary event i do no wish upon anyone . i 've EMOPOSITIVETRUST it in the past and is no EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVE . some people hear voices , others see ghosts or the likes . i hope you guys never have to experience such a thing . it 's good thing to know that it has a EMOANTICIPATIONFEARPOSITIVETRUST term and is not something actually paranormal .
in shocked at the EMOANTICIPATION , and now at the direct EMOPOSITIVE that the EMONEGATIVE EMONEGATIVE in america not only affects EMOSADNESS people ( adults ) , but also very EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVESURPRISE children as well . EMONEGATIVE overdoses are sad and EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVE but the same thing for a EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVE stirs EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESURPRISE and EMONEGATIVESADNESSTRUST within me to think of the reasons it occurs and that could certainly be prevented .
i was just EMOPOSITIVE this article and thinking about how EMOJOYPOSITIVESURPRISE we are to not have to experience such things . even when EMOPOSITIVE weather events or natural disasters are close by , we have the EMOPOSITIVE EMOFEARNEGATIVE and miss the EMOPOSITIVETRUST EMOANGERDISGUSTNEGATIVESADNESS . i 've never had to deal with anything like this and i think it would be so EMOFEAR -- i wonder how the EMOPOSITIVE will come together to support each other . it is so sad that so much EMOANGERNEGATIVE can EMOANTICIPATION so quickly and totally upend the lives of so many .
it is really sad this country is still having EMOPOSITIVE issues with EMOANGERNEGATIVE and EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS . being a EMONEGATIVE myself , i feel for the muslims and others who faced terrible treatment just because of their EMOTRUST . i hope you do n't have to experience these terrible things as they have . i would be really EMOPOSITIVE who you EMOPOSITIVE to just to be on the EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST side . it is an EMONEGATIVESURPRISE world we live in today EMONEGATIVESADNESS .
the people who will lose homes because of this should be EMOPOSITIVETRUST compensated and be EMOPOSITIVETRUST relocated with EMOPOSITIVE EMOFEARNEGATIVE EMOPOSITIVE and be transferred to a different location that is still nearby their old homes that will be razed . it 's just not EMOPOSITIVE if they will be leaving these people homeless and will probably have a hard EMOANTICIPATION coping with the EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS of their house if this EMOANTICIPATION gets approved .
hey EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST did you check out this article . we should do our best to EMOPOSITIVE ourselves and our loved ones from erika . i know that when my wife was pregnant i paid close EMOPOSITIVE to the news in order to be up to date with developments . it is really sad to see children being born with microphone . i really hope something will be done .
i am deeply EMOANGERNEGATIVESADNESS by what i have read in this article . it seems that a man EMOPOSITIVETRUST a senseless act of murder by pouring flammable liquid on an EMOPOSITIVETRUST bus driver and setting him afire . there is never an EMOPOSITIVE EMONEGATIVE for such an act . i can only EMOSURPRISE that racism is the motivation for the act as the EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS was a member of the indian EMOPOSITIVE .
keisha the singer opened up about how she was treated in the EMOJOYPOSITIVESADNESS industry ... it 's so EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS how EMOANTICIPATION after EMOANTICIPATION these EMONEGATIVESURPRISE stars , rappers an singers come out with these stories about how they got cheated , or that they find out that their manager had been EMODISGUSTFEARNEGATIVE from them for years , or EMOPOSITIVE them EMOTRUST that does n't actually EMONEGATIVETRUST the artist . the EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS is that a lot of these artists go into the EMOJOYPOSITIVESADNESS industry EMONEGATIVE and EMONEGATIVE and just take whatever hey can get ... whatever led , just to get their foot in the door but just end up getting EMOANGERNEGATIVE ,
for days , a hazy pall has spread across much of northern georgia , EMOPOSITIVE metro atlanta , home to 5.7 million people . state officials EMOANTICIPATIONFEARSURPRISE that the air is EMODISGUSTFEARNEGATIVESADNESS , and cautioned people with breathing problems to stay indoors as much as possible . with state firefighters EMONEGATIVE to quench the blazes currently active , officials told people to EMOFEARNEGATIVE starting new fires that could quickly spread . “ we ’re a cigar EMONEGATIVE away from a disaster , ” said EMODISGUSTNEGATIVE williams , EMOANTICIPATIONPOSITIVE EMOPOSITIVETRUST at dynamical falls , a state park near the southern terminus of the appalachian trail in georgia
hello , i EMOANTICIPATION this behavior was a thing of the past , but read this article , it is rather enlightening . i often think here in the us there is a great divide on how racial issues are dealt with , and the us is not the only one . there are many racial problems in other countries and that makes me feel EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS for the future . if we ca n't fix the issues here in america , how can we criticize other countries ?
those of you who smoke should EMONEGATIVE . once we EMONEGATIVE , we 're often EMOSURPRISE at the changes in attitude we experience regarding smoking , and life in EMOPOSITIVETRUST . when we EMONEGATIVE and win our EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST from EMONEGATIVE , our mindset changes . after i EMONEGATIVE i came to realize how much i really do n't like it ! i think i care more about myself now : my health , i stand up for myself when appropriate , i feel like there are more possibilities out there now without my smoking monkey on my back .
this is just part of the troubling times we live in . there is a EMOFEARNEGATIVE in the EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST house that a EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST of the people did not EMOPOSITIVETRUST and the russian EMOFEARNEGATIVE had a hand in EMOANTICIPATION to power . he is breaking laws everyday and has the most EMONEGATIVE EMOPOSITIVETRUST in my lifetime . his agenda is simply to cause EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS and to profit off this as much as possible . the sooner this failed EMOANTICIPATIONSURPRISE is over the better of the EMOTRUST will be . the only hope is that he does n't EMOANTICIPATION a nuclear EMOFEARNEGATIVE and that he will eventually be tried and brought to EMOPOSITIVETRUST for his numerous crimes .
we need to destroy the EMOTRUST that allows these things to EMOANTICIPATION . capitalism that reinforces these EMOANGERDISGUSTFEARNEGATIVE habits must be EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS utterly and the christian EMOTRUST should be wiped out in its entirety . there is no EMONEGATIVE for this EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST of repulsive behavior that drives people to abuse these children .
i said EMOSURPRISE would win . polls said otherwise , i did n't care , i knew the fucker would win . i think people are not willing to accept that others are really shitty and that someone like EMOSURPRISE would be voted in . they ca n't see past others . people have too much EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST in others , too much EMOTRUST . there are a lot of vile people out there , just got ta EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST them a little bit and they 'll come out . EMOSURPRISE was their EMOPOSITIVE . what will the liberals do now ? i do n't know . sometimes i think we will be okay , sometimes i think we wo n't . i just know that going to one EMOPOSITIVE is going to do EMOANGERDISGUSTNEGATIVE . you need tens of marches , packed to the brim . you need them every weekend . for months . you need to call your officials , EMOANGERNEGATIVESADNESS , EMOPOSITIVETRUST them , vote them out . do more . but one EMOPOSITIVE is n't going to do EMOANGERDISGUSTNEGATIVE .
here we go again , talking about political figures forging and waging EMOFEARNEGATIVE for the popular vote . they switch sides and EMOFEAR their point of view so much that it is easy to say they do n't care about the common person , only their chair in office . i think that the parties have merged into one , one mass all out EMOFEARNEGATIVE to get into office .
i read an article about a man who was caught smashing donald EMOSURPRISE 's EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST in hollywood . he had a sledgehammer and was smashing it . i EMOANTICIPATION it sounded EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST funny . the article described some of the ways people are protesting , from covering the EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST with graffiti , to putting a bernie sanders sticker on it , to putting a barbed wire fence around it . i do n't like that he even has a EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST , and i think if i were to go to hollywood , i 'd like to do something like this as well .
man that 's EMONEGATIVESADNESS to read- i remember watching those events EMOANTICIPATIONPOSITIVE and just being absolutely EMOANGERDISGUSTNEGATIVESADNESS and EMOFEARNEGATIVE over it . i remember EMOFEARNEGATIVE that they were EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS hostages one by one on the news , and just bursting into tears at that point . this article really vividly reminded me of that moment , it 's really sad .
this is the world we live in now . until we have heavy weapons that are meant for EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS like guns , explosives , and machines , we will never have an end in the EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS in middle east -- or any country for that matter . if it does finish , a lot of people will EMONEGATIVE and EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS first which is worrisome . millions and millions of people experience subhuman living conditions and there 's nothing we can do .
i certainly feel bad for people having to live in such EMOANGERDISGUSTFEARNEGATIVE conditions . however , i also feel bad for the regions that these refugees are going to . it has to be a huge strain on these countries to accept large EMOPOSITIVE of homeless that will just EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS their EMOTRUST . it is a EMONEGATIVESADNESS situation and i can see both sides of it .
i think these people have been EMOANGERNEGATIVE each other over tribalism and ideology since i can remember . in talking about iraq , which is dividing into 3 EMOPOSITIVE groups who have competed for EMOANGERNEGATIVESADNESS EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST for a EMOANTICIPATION EMOANTICIPATION . and the EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST of oil taken by the leaders and not shared with EMOPOSITIVE for all people has increased tensions . when i was EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVESURPRISE it was iraq iran EMOFEARNEGATIVE , the saddam hussein reign of EMOFEARNEGATIVE , then the first gulf EMOFEARNEGATIVE , the the second iraq EMOFEARNEGATIVE , then isis . these people have something EMONEGATIVE with them and i think they EMOANGERFEAR some responsibility for their own EMODISGUSTFEARNEGATIVESADNESS .
this right here is bullshit . i do n't know who wrote this EMOANGERDISGUSTNEGATIVE article but from what i read it argues that livestock are more a EMOPOSITIVETRUST to gas emissions in our atmosphere then vehicle emissions . it spouts some EMOPOSITIVE and EMOPOSITIVETRUST but i can see straight away this is a fabricated article that is EMOPOSITIVE EMONEGATIVE . this is the EMODISGUSTNEGATIVE we need to take out of our news .
i am so moved and EMOANGERDISGUSTNEGATIVE really of the people of south korea . for them to protest there EMOPOSITIVETRUST , who is totally EMONEGATIVE for all she did , is something to be admired . i EMOJOYPOSITIVE the EMOPOSITIVE of the people to not stop until she leaves office . if only it was that easy for us americans to do the same with EMOSURPRISE .
i just read this article about trees dying across the country and i ca n't understand why more people are n't EMOFEARSADNESS about this . if we lose our trees we lose everything . it makes me EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS that people are n't paying EMOPOSITIVE and could care less about the snowball effect that is happening because of climate EMOFEAR . because of us !
just when you think things could n't get much EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS ! i just ca n't imagine who in the world would EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS , then mutilate a EMOJOYPOSITIVE EMOTRUST ! it EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST much sounds like someone with a mental health issue is running around EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS with a EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVE . it is nice to know so many nonprofits are not only EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST in finding this EMOANGERDISGUSTFEARNEGATIVE , but also to EMOFEAR this from happening again , i think the adult horses were in better EMOPOSITIVE and that 's why they survived . what EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST of EMONEGATIVE EMODISGUSTNEGATIVE would mutilate the little EMOTRUST 's genitals ?
a EMONEGATIVE arkansas EMOFEARTRUST left her EMOFEARPOSITIVETRUST dog in the EMOTRUST car in the middle of summer and the poor thing died . she 's on EMOTRUST EMONEGATIVESADNESSSURPRISE while the EMOSURPRISE is being investigated . what 's to EMOPOSITIVE ? the dog did n't lock itself in the car . she should at least be EMOANTICIPATIONNEGATIVEPOSITIVE fired for being too EMONEGATIVE to be a EMOFEARTRUST .
these people were guests who were presumably staying illegally at this camp . they were allowed to stay there out of EMOFEARPOSITIVE , i 'm assuming . then , when they 're told that something else has to be figured out , they lose it . when you give a group something , even if it does n't belong to them and even if you 're being EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST my doing it , they EMOANTICIPATIONNEGATIVEPOSITIVE feel like it belongs to them and will EMOANGERFEAR EMOPOSITIVE if you try to take it away .
too many EMOPOSITIVE . too many EMOPOSITIVE . too many EMOPOSITIVE . too many EMOPOSITIVE . too many EMOPOSITIVE . too many EMOPOSITIVE . too many EMOPOSITIVE . too many EMOPOSITIVE . too many EMOPOSITIVE . too many EMOPOSITIVE . too many EMOPOSITIVE . too many EMOPOSITIVE . too many EMOPOSITIVE . too many EMOPOSITIVE . too many EMOPOSITIVE . too many EMOPOSITIVE . too many EMOPOSITIVE . too many EMOPOSITIVE . too many EMOPOSITIVE . too many EMOPOSITIVE . too many EMOPOSITIVE . too many EMOPOSITIVE . too many EMOPOSITIVE . too many EMOPOSITIVE . too many EMOPOSITIVE . too many EMOPOSITIVE . too many EMOPOSITIVE . too many EMOPOSITIVE . too many EMOPOSITIVE . too many EMOPOSITIVE . too many EMOPOSITIVE .
this whole article is a little EMONEGATIVE , it seems like they 're EMOFEAR stuff . this article , if you want to be really cynical and EMONEGATIVE , makes it sound like the kids might be EMOPOSITIVETRUST for the deaths of the parents . it seems like a EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST EMONEGATIVE article , i wish we had more EMOPOSITIVE on this EMOSURPRISE .
i 'm not sure how to feel about this . we really do need to go EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST , but at what point do we call it EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST when it kills so many animals ? i 'm a little EMODISGUSTFEARNEGATIVESURPRISE , even though i know science needs evidence in EMOPOSITIVE , that they are EMODISGUSTFEARNEGATIVESADNESS money on figuring out that species that typically migrate are * EMOSURPRISE * being killed in places other than where they are from . put that money towards developing something that stops the EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS . we need EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST energy like wind and solar , so let 's find a EMOPOSITIVE to make it so that we do n't keep EMOANGERNEGATIVESADNESS what we 're trying to EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST .
i had no EMOANTICIPATION oklahoma was getting so many earthquakes lately . apparently due to the oil companies injecting EMODISGUSTNEGATIVE it is triggering a lot more earthquakes . they are n't massive ones , but still 5.0 is EMOPOSITIVE . it caused some EMOANGERDISGUSTNEGATIVESADNESS to buildings and stuff . people even at the oil company felt it really well . it shook everyone up a good bit . but its EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS that its becoming the norm there ! so EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS .
i hear the british EMOFEARNEGATIVE is looking to drill for oil again . this EMOANTICIPATION they are looking to drill near the murchison falls national park in uganda . everyone is so EMONEGATIVEPOSITIVETRUST on oil all the EMOANTICIPATION . too bad for some giraffes that live there as they will be EMOANGERFEARSADNESS . of course i could really care less about giraffes 5000 miles away from me . still i wish the giraffes the best i suppose . brits are such weasels it figures they would look to EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS a bunch of giraffes for their own EMOANGERDISGUSTNEGATIVE gains . governments all EMODISGUSTNEGATIVE .
i remember where i was when the paris EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVE happened . it was so terrible how i felt and how everyone around the world felt . these terrible people are trying to make us scared to do things we EMOJOYPOSITIVE . but i wo nt let them win . in so EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST the band decided to go back and give a concert . this has to be a EMOPOSITIVETRUST for us all . EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVE will never win !
this is what happens when you take in people from an EMONEGATIVE EMOPOSITIVETRUST . all of these refugees need to be throw back into their EMONEGATIVE pit . their EMOTRUST embraces hatred . let them figure out how to live in EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST in their own countries , then we can allow them into EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST world . is it is now , i think all of europe is EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS .
hey . i 'm not sure if you have ever considered getting yourself screened for colon cancer . from what i have read , the prep for this screening seems quite EMODISGUSTNEGATIVESADNESS . EMONEGATIVE massive amounts of a EMODISGUSTNEGATIVE EMOPOSITIVE heavy with salt does n't seem to be like a good EMOANTICIPATION to me . i noticed that some items from a company have made it to phase two trials through the fda . one is a EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST bar and the other one is a smoothie . they are supposed to have some EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST of flavors to them like strawberry and EMODISGUSTNEGATIVE . i EMOSURPRISE this should help with the process .
i really do not understand what has become of our society . have you heard about the guy who shot several people at the shopping mall?because of him , six people were EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS and three dead and some three people had eye injuries because of the EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS glasses . the guy is only 20 from turkey and EMOSURPRISE what , he has been charged with murder because he confessed .
that 's a really strange and messed up situation . it 's really sad for the children involved and it 's very troubling that any country could EMOANTICIPATION out such an awful EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVE . i hope that things EMOFEAR in those areas of the world and more security is put in place so these types of attacks can be detected and negated .
check out this article about the erika EMONEGATIVE . i did not know that there was so much going on with it , or that it spread so much . i also did not know that it can spread through the ways they described in the article , like EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST . definitely EMOPOSITIVE we need to know make sure to read up on this and be EMOPOSITIVE !
there should be a class EMOPOSITIVE lawsuit against the company putting out EMOFEARNEGATIVE products . they are liable for any injuries they have caused . people should be given EMOANGERPOSITIVE for the EMONEGATIVESADNESS they have suffered . i am EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVE kyle is speaking out against this and hopefully she can EMOFEAR further injuries to EMOSURPRISE consumers .
oh my gosh ! can you even imagine this ? thinking of citizens being EMONEGATIVE from their homes , tortured , EMOFEARNEGATIVESURPRISE ! how could they just blatantly violate people in this way ? i suppose it is hopeful that we might EMOPOSITIVE from this , correct mistakes , but that does n't mitigate the EMOFEARNEGATIVE that was done ! it also does n't bode well that EMOPOSITIVETRUST the victims now , after the EMOTRUST , also seems to be in EMOPOSITIVE . the assumption that they were informed of the release of the data , i think , is EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVE . EMOPOSITIVETRUST that the already EMODISGUSTFEARNEGATIVESADNESS victims wo n't be further victimized is as EMOPOSITIVETRUST as the far reaching implications of the data itself ! i wonder why there is no mention of the ramifications to the department either . just releasing the data is great , but what about investigations and punishments ?
a mother pushed a stroller onto an elevator that was not there . the EMOJOYPOSITIVE dies of injuries and the mother was EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS . the EMOPOSITIVE had over 100 elevator violations but did not stay on EMOANTICIPATIONPOSITIVETRUST of things to make sure the elevators were EMOPOSITIVE properly . the EMOPOSITIVE EMONEGATIVE caused an infants death . i ca nt imagine going through something like that , that poor mother .
damaging the amazon rain forest , one of the most iconic and well - known rain forests known to man , just to get oil is simply EMOANGERDISGUSTNEGATIVESADNESS . the us 's hunt for EMODISGUSTNEGATIVE oil is EMOANTICIPATION with EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS consequences and needs to be rectified . by tearing down the amazon trees , hurtful greenhouse gases are EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVE into the air , damaging the air quality around us . corporations should n't be able to EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS the environment like this . it makes me EMOANGERDISGUSTNEGATIVE .
" hey , i just read an article written by a snowflake that is melting under man made " " global warming " " . one thing i have never understood is how the EMONEGATIVE party took over the environmental movement without a shot . remember when we EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST out the founder of ' EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST ' left after discovering the EMOFEAR of EMONEGATIVE and socialist EMOANTICIPATION into academia and the organization he started ? i wish someone would actually do some research instead of repeating the same old stuff . "
the articular is he us closed its education gender EMONEGATIVE in 2016 . this means there is a large EMOPOSITIVE of EMOPOSITIVE EMOPOSITIVE EMOPOSITIVE , even though fewer women are actually EMOPOSITIVE , as can be seen in the table showing the EMOPOSITIVETRUST states ' scores below . the annual report looks at EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVE towards EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST between men and women in four key areas : EMOPOSITIVETRUST EMOPOSITIVE , health and survival , economic EMOANTICIPATIONPOSITIVE , and political empowerment .
i 've never heard of this person or this EMOPOSITIVE EMOTRUST , have you ? mostly i find this stuff EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST of EMONEGATIVE , and although it 's sad for people to lose their jobs , this happens all the EMOANTICIPATION , and to people who have probably earned a lot less than these people , and who have a lot less prospects of being reemployed . shows are canceled all the EMOANTICIPATION , so i get EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST of annoyed with this EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST of news .
apparently another christian was murdered in a muslim EMOPOSITIVE , and the EMONEGATIVE was that he blasphemed , when he had really just shared an anti - isis cartoon . it is no wonder that religious minorities in syria EMOPOSITIVE assad . at least he protects them . he probably has EMOPOSITIVETRUST atrocities , but it seems every side has EMOPOSITIVETRUST atrocities there . this murder was in jordan , and even though the jordanian royals come off as urbane westerners , there is obviously an undercurrent of extreme islamism in some of the EMOPOSITIVE . christians are murdered all the EMOANTICIPATION around the world , but this rarely gets EMOPOSITIVE in the us media , which is EMOPOSITIVE EMONEGATIVE .
" that article was a steaming pile of EMONEGATIVE . storied about criminals emboldened to EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVE and EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS cops by the media 's sympathetic EMOANGERNEGATIVE towards criminals is a regular occurrence these days . EMONEGATIVESADNESS lives matter is a borderline terrorist organization who believes there should be no laws , or at the very least , that EMONEGATIVESADNESS people should be exempt from them . they 're in favor of abolishing the EMOFEARPOSITIVETRUST and EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS EMOTRUST . what sane person riots over a EMOANGERDISGUSTFEARNEGATIVE getting the inevitable ending that comes from EMOTRUST a lawless and EMOFEARNEGATIVE life ? when i read about a EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST EMOANGERDISGUSTFEARNEGATIVE getting killed in a confrontation with the EMOFEARPOSITIVETRUST , i feel EMOPOSITIVE . my instinct is to say " " good riddance " " and not go out and EMONEGATIVE a liquor EMOANTICIPATIONPOSITIVE and burn down fast EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST restaurants . "
" EMOSURPRISE jess raphael was on the EMOTRUST " " where are they now " " with oprah , she claims she was betrayed by her producers . i remember watching her EMOTRUST in the 80 's and 90 's . it had become a EMOTRUST like jerry sp EMOANGERNEGATIVE and she claims she wishes she had spoken up about the direction the EMOTRUST was going . she felt like her staff of 250 people EMOANTICIPATION she knew the EMOTRUST was going to be canceled in 2002 but she did not know anything about it . she was a strong personality and i think if she wanted to EMOFEAR the direction of the EMOTRUST she could have . hindsight is twenty - twenty .

if it 's not bad enough that the EMOTRUST is a EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVE molester who molested his own EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVE , the mother had the EMOPOSITIVE to EMOPOSITIVE in on the abuse . i EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESSTRUST very serious if she was EMOFEARNEGATIVE to do it as she could have divorced him or left him rather commit such a EMONEGATIVE EMOANGERNEGATIVE and money is no EMONEGATIVE . i would n't molest my EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVE for all the money in the world . these people were just sicking EMOANGERDISGUSTFEARNEGATIVE sorry excuses for human beings .

i 'm at a EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS for EMOANGERNEGATIVE when i think of all the senseless lives EMONEGATIVESADNESS from EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVE EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS . as a EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVE EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST maybe i should take a step back and ask myself the hard questions about guns and there impact and availability in today 's society . i know that statistically more people EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS from other causes compared to EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVE EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS , but are guns way to EMOPOSITIVE in america compared to other countries ? when the 2nd amendment was written could they imagine the way guns could have progressed or how they are being used today ? seeing so many mass shootings makes me feel that maybe it 's EMOANTICIPATION to EMOFEAR some of the EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVE laws and help make things like 40 children killed or EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS a thing of the past .
all of you know that i EMOJOYPOSITIVE birds . this article was hard for me to read because of that . wind turbines are EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS a lot of birds , EMOPOSITIVE eagles . it 's really very sad . it makes me feel awful . i am all for wind turbines and renewable sources of energy because of global warming and coal , but this is awful . i do n't want these poor birds to EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS like this . read this article and you 'll see why .

hey , take a look at this . lots of EMONEGATIVE EMOPOSITIVE here , but it 'd be awesome if there 's any EMOPOSITIVETRUST in this story . i hate to see when animals are in EMOANGERDISGUSTFEARNEGATIVE conditions like that , though of course peat always goes way too far with their EMOANGER . maybe that 's why i 'm not sure what 's EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST and what 's not in this article ?
this article i just read is EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST disturbing . it 's about a guy who was trying to warm up inside a EMOANGER spring that EMONEGATIVESADNESS into one that was way too EMOANGER , and was basically boiled EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST . it 's sad , and apparently one of the people with him caught it on camera . the really disturbing part comes when the authorities could n't get to the body because of how EMOANGER it was , and when they came back , they discovered that it had dissolved EMOPOSITIVE . that part creeper me out .
this article highlights the EMOTRUST that we might be going on about our lives , secure in the EMOPOSITIVE that everything is fine , but then EMOSURPRISE when you least EMOANTICIPATIONPOSITIVESURPRISETRUST it , we are reminded of our own EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS . it makes me want to live each and every day as well as i can , because i never know if it might be my last . sometimes we think we have forever , but this article is a reminder that each day we live on this earth , imperfect though it may be , is a EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVESURPRISE .

despite our best efforts , it really is nearly EMONEGATIVESADNESS to keep our children and families from the cruel nature of the world . even something like a EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVE to another country or a EMOSURPRISE to EMOANTICIPATIONFEAR fireworks can EMOANTICIPATION in EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS that leaves EMOPOSITIVE scars . this is a world we want to EMOFEARNEGATIVE , but find ourselves surrounded by almost always .

all of this EMOFEARSADNESS in the middle east makes me EMOFEARNEGATIVE to ever EMONEGATIVESADNESSSURPRISE north america . i 'm EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVE that it turned out that the EMOFEAR was mentally EMOFEARNEGATIVESURPRISE instead of being involved in a larger plot . i wish i had some answers that could make all this EMOFEARNEGATIVE easier but i just do n't understand why everyone ca n't just get along .
this article was very EMOPOSITIVE but also written a little strange . it was about a wolf who had wondered off from the pack . the wolf was a EMOTRUST wolf part of a group being EMOTRUST by some biological organization . had a tracking monitor on him and his life was largely documented . i EMOSURPRISE he wondered from the pack looking to EMOPOSITIVETRUST . well the EMOFEARNEGATIVE , federal EMOFEARNEGATIVE , killed the wolf by a sniper person and its caused a big EMONEGATIVE . EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST of EMODISGUSTNEGATIVE but i EMOSURPRISE that is a thing .
now a days EMOANGERNEGATIVE rate increased and now no EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST for muslim EMOTRUST on usa , the american 's doing something fishy and wanted . on new york city a muslim woman ’s clothing was set on EMOFEAR while she walked down new york city ’s fifth avenue , the EMOFEARPOSITIVETRUST suspected a man who is EMOPOSITIVE with lighter and who ran away .
hello EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST , this article scared me . i ca n't believe how high EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS rates have become in EMONEGATIVEPOSITIVE . i understand that EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVESURPRISE EMONEGATIVEPOSITIVE are more inclined to act impulsively . one bad day at EMOTRUST can trier a EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS EMOANTICIPATION , that 's EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS ! schools should do a much better EMOPOSITIVE EMOPOSITIVETRUST children from bullying . i know that 's EMONEGATIVESADNESS to EMOANGERNEGATIVE it , but it schools and parents take the issue seriously enough , we could at least reduce the number of suicides .
i just read a very sad article on the elderly that are stuck in aleppo , syria due to the EMOFEARNEGATIVE there . apparently , 200,000 people are EMONEGATIVESADNESS to get out due to the EMOFEARNEGATIVE 's siege of the area . there is a decreased access to EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST and EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST for EMOANTICIPATION term EMOANTICIPATIONFEARPOSITIVETRUST conditions are EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS . the elderly are having to sacrifice their well - being for the well - being of their children and EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST . the EMOFEARNEGATIVE needs to come to an end soon , before there is more EMODISGUSTFEARNEGATIVESADNESS by the people of syria .
what an EMOFEARNEGATIVESURPRISE statistic ! i had no idea that such things even existed ! while it 's EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST that this seems to be much more of a EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS in russia than in the us , since it 's on the internet it is still something that could potentially be accessed by our kids ! teenagers have enough to deal with without having to EMOANTICIPATIONFEARNEGATIVESADNESS about being prodded into doing something EMOANGERDISGUSTFEARNEGATIVE like committing EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS by these online idiots ! i remember being a teenager and how hard it was , but i did n't have to deal with this ! this is EMOPOSITIVE awful !
it 's EMOANGERDISGUSTNEGATIVE that this day in age and for such an EMOPOSITIVE country , we ca n't even get water right . it should be a priority that a basic EMOSADNESS for life be EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST . if we ca n't do water right , how can we do anything else right ? it 's a freaking EMONEGATIVE . our whole governmental EMOTRUST is a EMODISGUSTNEGATIVE . and yet , no one does anything .
have i conveyed my misanthropy EMOPOSITIVETRUST yet . read this for a EMOJOYPOSITIVESURPRISE . this is what journalists are doing . we have an orange monkey EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS our EMOTRUST and people spend EMOANTICIPATION writing about something as EMONEGATIVESADNESS as this . a guy died . EMOSADNESS sorry . happens thousands and thousands times a day . because this guy was an EMODISGUSTNEGATIVE it gets written up to feed the EMOANGERDISGUSTNEGATIVE interests of the sheep .
this EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST of thing happens in north korea all the EMOANTICIPATION . the country has so little usable farmland , that any weather EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESURPRISE is a EMOPOSITIVE EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS . this is what happened during the EMONEGATIVE EMOPOSITIVE in the 90s , after kim il sung died . the country had a couple bad years because of EMONEGATIVE and then flooding , and EMOSURPRISE everyone was EMONEGATIVE .
as a parent , i feel that is definitely one of my responsibilities to EMOJOYPOSITIVESURPRISETRUST my children the EMOANTICIPATIONPOSITIVE of EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST and taking care of our environment . without the EMOANTICIPATIONFEARSADNESS , the animals will have nowhere to live , and without the EMOANTICIPATIONFEARSADNESS , what will our animals be EMOFEARNEGATIVE to live in . what i want them to remember is that they are the ones living in the environment , not the environment invading on our lives . we must take care of it in order to make sure that we have a sustainable environment our children 's children .
i EMOANTICIPATION that this article was something very hurtful to read . i was EMOPOSITIVE about the EMOFEAR and what happened to the place that these people live and it said that these people got EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS and EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS and i felt very bad for them . i wish that there was a way that everyone could help along to . the people should be more EMOPOSITIVE about the EMOFEAR and see the safety next EMOANTICIPATION .
i think that rm may weather should have to EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST that money back if he still has the EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVE or give the EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVE back to the EMOANTICIPATIONPOSITIVE with a price tag like that the company could really need that money 1.4 million is a lot of money for a company not to get . also we know that he has the money to EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST for the EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVE so mi not sure why he does n't just EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST the EMOPOSITIVE of the EMOPOSITIVE and not have to go to EMOANGERANTICIPATIONFEAR and EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST all those fees .
he said it would not stop him returning to the field to help EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST wildlife . van nicker said they were called last weekend to EMOPOSITIVETRUST a EMOTRUST who had caught a poacher near sabin river . “ my colleagues and i , with four mozambican EMOFEARPOSITIVETRUST officers , were transporting the poacher to the station , which was about 30 km away , when he EMOFEAR from the vehicle . i chased after the poacher and caught him . i handed him back to the EMOFEARPOSITIVETRUST EMOPOSITIVETRUST . EMOSURPRISE , a EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVE from the EMOPOSITIVE started moving towards us , ” said van nicker . the EMOFEARPOSITIVETRUST officers who were with them ran away . “ we , the rangers , were the targets .
i was sad to hear that a woman was critically EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS sunday evening in a multiple car wreck in the clinton area of EMOPOSITIVE george ’s EMOTRUST . it seems like these things are becoming more common . at least the reporting of such accidents is more common . people should EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST more EMOPOSITIVE to their driving . i would n't be EMOSURPRISE at all if someone involved was EMOANGERNEGATIVE by cellphone use .
i find this article to be EMONEGATIVE . it talks about how EMOSURPRISE supporters are attacking actors from the EMOTRUST silicon valley . i 'm not a silicon valley fan and i do not know who those actors are , but i believe that if there were ever to be a EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVE that escalates due to differing political opinion , i would just walk up and EMONEGATIVESADNESSSURPRISE .
i find that it is of a EMOPOSITIVETRUST , and am writing to you regarding this situation that is erupting in yemen , that after the EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST talks collapsed security and safety for citizens in these areas has greatly decreased . i find that how america feels about it , and others around the world , is more correct , than in EMONEGATIVESADNESS . whereby they are appalled by all the EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS and blood EMONEGATIVE . i feel personally that each party should consider the welfare of the people at large , than any self - aggrandizement , and EMOTRUST power plays . it they can become more self - less , and less EMOANGERDISGUSTNEGATIVE , they will make decisions that are in the best EMOPOSITIVE and safety of the people of yemen , aside and apart of whatever their political ideologies may be , when they are saving lives , and not just garnering votes , or political power
the article was about EMODISGUSTNEGATIVE at the international EMOANTICIPATIONPOSITIVE fund , specifically the EMOANGERDISGUSTNEGATIVESADNESS of former boss rodrigo cato . the banking industry is EMONEGATIVE with issues like this , so it comes as no surprise that someone was trying to take EMOPOSITIVE of the EMOTRUST even in an international organization like the imf . the EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS is that we do not have enough prosecutors that are willing to take on the banking industry and put them in their place . i 'm EMONEGATIVE of EMOTRUST EMOFEARNEGATIVE about people getting away with EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST collar crimes .
although this is bad , i have to admit that it 's also rather funny . i do wonder what caused the squirrel to go on such a EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVE . perhaps it felt threatened ? maybe it was abused ? perhaps it got caught inside and out of EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVE did what animals do - EMONEGATIVE and EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVE their way out . i 'm assuming it was the latter EMOPOSITIVE and this just happened to be an odd situation . i do n't think it meant to EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS anyone , i think it was just scared and people got bit because they got in its way . i ca n't imagine another EMOPOSITIVE than that . and the people were fine anyway .
" male models are paid a lot less than EMOPOSITIVE models , which is EMOPOSITIVE considering all of the news lately about a " " wage EMONEGATIVE " " that some people believe exists . each industry has a different set of EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST and things and that 's fine , you have to look at the individual characteristics when judging whether something is EMONEGATIVE . it 's very EMOPOSITIVE that this is starting to EMOFEAR though , as male products become a bigger market for companies . "
isis is now one of the EMOPOSITIVE terrorists group operating in iraq . the iraqi security forces are in EMOPOSITIVETRUST EMOFEARNEGATIVE with it . isis have killed around 800 pol in iraqi city of mosul and using 1000s of civilian as human shield to stop iraqi forces advance and it make me EMONEGATIVESADNESS that when it going to stop . we eliminate one group and another one EMONEGATIVESURPRISE up . this is a EMOPOSITIVE concern for the world
i find it EMOPOSITIVE to view the lives of primates in order to try and understand how it relates to our own . the way that the primates dealt with farsightedness seemed very practical to me which shows off their ingenuity and EMOPOSITIVE to EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS solve . it makes me wonder if that 's where humans get their own EMOPOSITIVE to EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS solve as well .
it 's amazing what people will do to EMOFEARNEGATIVE EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESSSURPRISE . i just heard about a guy who was EMOFEARSADNESS over urinary EMOANTICIPATION issues and decided the best way to figure out his EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS was to EMOANGERNEGATIVE a EMOPOSITIVE steel chopstick into his urethra . it had to be removed via EMOFEARSADNESS , and it sounds like it was EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST , but jesus christ man , go to a EMOPOSITIVETRUST .
yet another EMOPOSITIVE to have more strict immigration rules . these people know the dangers that they face when they do this , so it is hard to feel very sorry for them . i do n't think EMOPOSITIVE them more EMOPOSITIVE on these dangers will stop them , but patrolling the waters and turning these human traffickers back will . if it is made EMOFEAR for these human traffickers to exploit these people , it will EMOANTICIPATION less often .
i think that it would a great thing if all students could get connected to the internet . the internet will EMOPOSITIVETRUST them ways to EMOPOSITIVE more and it will help them further their education as well . i think that EMOPOSITIVETRUST obama 's EMOANTICIPATION for the internet should have really worked better to so that all students can have an EMOANTICIPATIONPOSITIVE to use computers anytime that they want to .
hello EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST . i am really very EMOSURPRISE at all the things that have happened and EMOANTICIPATIONPOSITIVETRUST and EMOANTICIPATIONPOSITIVETRUST to EMOANTICIPATION in the world . now the big EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS we are facing in this part of the EMOPOSITIVETRUST states of america is a new outbreak or EMONEGATIVE . the specialists in the field of health still do not know what this EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS is due to and how to stop it . here i write part of what i have learned on the EMONEGATIVE . this started in november and the symptoms are EMOFEAR , a lot of chills , and EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS to breathe
if he is not EMOPOSITIVETRUST for the killings , it would be baffling as to why he would EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVE the officers . if it turns out that he was EMOPOSITIVETRUST for these killings , it is good that he can no longer EMOFEARNEGATIVE anyone else . it must be a EMOPOSITIVE - wracking EMOPOSITIVE to be a EMOFEARPOSITIVETRUST EMOPOSITIVETRUST , EMOPOSITIVE that at any moment someone could EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVE you for no good EMOPOSITIVE .
this story about the EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVE at the EMOANTICIPATION is absolutely breaking my heart . there is no EMOPOSITIVE for these violent EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVE actions to EMOANTICIPATIONPOSITIVETRUST to go on . can you imagine if this had been our dad or other EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST or family member ? i can not imagine what the victims family is going through right now . the poor people in the EMOANTICIPATION must have been in a EMONEGATIVE . it had to have been scary to not know what was going on . especially before everyone knew the gunman was dead . this one cowards acts caused so much EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS and EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS for so many people . can you imagine all of the money that was EMOANGERDISGUSTNEGATIVE because of his EMONEGATIVE choices . between flights being canceled , rearranged , EMOFEARPOSITIVETRUST officers EMOANTICIPATION . i wish we could understand what he was thinking and why he did this EMODISGUSTNEGATIVE .
it looks like EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS in iraq . the islamic state ( is ) has taken over mosul and people are getting the hell out of there . the EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS is , there is nowhere to go . there are a few camps for refugees but not nearly enough space . people are even taking there sheep which ca n’t be EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST … the is has had people under their EMOFEARTRUST for almost 3 years and the people are making a run from it . no EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESSTRUST they have every EMOPOSITIVE – the EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVESURPRISE women and girls feel veil - less EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST ! the is EMOPOSITIVETRUST au baker al - baghdadi . the were right to EMONEGATIVESADNESSSURPRISE as the city is now a EMOFEARNEGATIVE zone with iraqi security forces retaking the city . it is a bitter EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVE with the EMOPOSITIVETRUST “ blood will spill ” messages rampant . many families are leaving and there are some really heart - wrenching tales . so sad … many are in EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVE .
there are too many EMOFEARPOSITIVETRUST shootings . however , being in the EMOFEARPOSITIVETRUST is not an easy EMOPOSITIVE . too many people are in a rush to EMOSURPRISE . if cities would be more forthright and transparent it would help . why people feel that EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS and looting is a valid method of protest is beyond me . i have great EMOPOSITIVESADNESS for the EMOFEARPOSITIVETRUST .
this is so sad guys . :( i ca n't believe this , i never knew how far reaching climate EMOFEAR actually was . these poor turtles are dying because of the temperature changes . please do something , write your local senator so we can EMOANTICIPATION to reverse this . we need to get back into the climate accords and become a EMOPOSITIVETRUST in environmental sustainability , instead of what we have been doing .
the EMOPOSITIVETRUST EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS with people born with critical EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS is that we try so hard to give them a normal life . however these people are not normal . and to EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVE them into feeling normal while a nice sentiment , is hardly EMOPOSITIVE . instead we should EMOPOSITIVE on how these people can live EMOSURPRISE than trying to EMOANTICIPATIONPOSITIVE them into EMOPOSITIVETRUST society . society it 's self is a EMOANGERDISGUSTFEARNEGATIVE EMOPOSITIVE of work till you EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS . no matter what it is you chose to do . take autism for example , we try so hard to normalize them . however with my experience these people are EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST in their own ways that we ca n't understand . they see things in an EMODISGUSTFEARNEGATIVE like manor of ultra basic instinct . this instinct should have it 's own way of flourishing instead of bowing down to the EMOPOSITIVE of us .
the whole situation with iraq and the EMOANGERANTICIPATIONFEARNEGATIVE of isis can be attributed to the u.s. EMOFEARNEGATIVE on EMOFEARNEGATIVE and failed attempts at establishing EMOPOSITIVE in the middle east . the EMOPOSITIVETRUST of the matter is , the g.w. bush administration had no idea what they were doing when they decided to invade iraq under the EMONEGATIVE of ridding saddam hussein of weapons of mass EMOANGERNEGATIVE : iraq had none , and we EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS the iraqi way of life over this EMOANGERDISGUSTNEGATIVESADNESS . iraqis may have suffered under saddam hussein , but at the very least , the region was EMOPOSITIVETRUST and extremists were rare . after the american EMOANGERNEGATIVE , civilian deaths likely skyrocketed because EMOTRUST and order were thrown out as well .
our EMOTRUST has failed us once again and continues to fail us EMOANTICIPATION . the idea that a foster care EMOTRUST allows for brothers to be EMONEGATIVE apart that came in together in EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVE . it 's strange to me that we treat human life as if it is less than EMOPOSITIVETRUST . i wish that people would wake up from the old - world ideals and behavior . thanks to the 20ht century and the EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST of film as a story - telling mechanic , we have the EMOPOSITIVE to be able to EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST stories with each other on a bigger EMOPOSITIVETRUST . i ca n't believe that it 's 2018 and we still operate as if it 's 1400 a.d . i am disgusted by our modern EMOPOSITIVE and our governmental EMOTRUST . it 's all a EMOANGERDISGUSTNEGATIVE . we are slaves .
this article was really inspiring . the woman in it goes through so much but she still tries to persevere . i think it is EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST to not give up in the face of such obstacles . but i imagine it was really EMOFEAR for her to do ! imagine being in EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS like that ... it 's EMODISGUSTFEARNEGATIVESADNESS . what do you think of this article ? is n't it inspiring ?
hey i know you are busy but i wanted to EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST something that is laying heavy on my heart . the nigerian paper is reporting of mass rape done by the EMOFEARNEGATIVE . women and children were raped by policemen , soldiers , camp leaders and vigilante groups . this makes my blood EMODISGUSTNEGATIVE . how does this make you feel ? what can we do ?
the driven into EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS last year , and he is now based in the southern port city of aden . saudi arabia ’s sunni muslim monarchy entered the EMOFEARNEGATIVE in large part because of concerns of iranian EMONEGATIVEPOSITIVE in the region . that shiite theocracy is widely perceived to be backing the shiite rebels . the airstrikes in come on the same day i EMONEGATIVE a new u.n. EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST proposal that would have sidelined him and given the prominent roles in a new EMOFEARNEGATIVE . more than 10,000 people have died in the EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS , many of them civilians who were killed by saudi - led EMOPOSITIVE bombings , according to the EMOPOSITIVETRUST nations . that you have read the first article , please write a message to a EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST or friends about your feelings and thoughts regarding the article you just read . this could be a private message to a EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST s.
this must be terrifying to have people come into your town , drag you from your home , and to EMOANTICIPATIONFEAR while those you EMOJOYPOSITIVE are taken or shot , really it must be EMODISGUSTNEGATIVESADNESS , even as you EMOPOSITIVE it . we get EMOANGERNEGATIVESADNESS when we hear news of one or two people being kidnapped or EMODISGUSTFEARNEGATIVESADNESS this EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST of trauma , yet here we 're talking about much more . it must be heartbreaking for them .
this article is very , very , eye - opening and EMOPOSITIVE to read about the the seven biggest threats that EMOPOSITIVETRUST EMOSURPRISE poses to the environment . i think with EMOPOSITIVETRUST EMOSURPRISE backing out of the paris EMOPOSITIVETRUST and not really focusing a little bit of more efforts on global warming , there can be a big EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS in the future .
this feels so typical . the burden of EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST has fallen to the woman for decades , ever since the oral contraceptive was introduced . women frequently have to decide between accepting disturbing side effects or accepting the EMOANTICIPATIONFEARNEGATIVE of EMODISGUSTNEGATIVE , whereas men have never had to make that EMOPOSITIVE . there will never be EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST until men and women face the risks and consequences of EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST EMOPOSITIVE .
wow ! i did;t know tigers were in such trouble ! this makes me want to do more research and donate to the national tiger EMOANTICIPATIONPOSITIVETRUST EMOPOSITIVETRUST . we must EMOPOSITIVE these animals ! it is so disturbing that poaching is still so problematic in today 's society . i have heard of poaching of other animals , but rarely about tigers . i hope something can be done , and soon , to help tigers .
i have never heard of sleep paralysis but it does n't sound like a particularly EMOFEARNEGATIVE EMOFEARNEGATIVE . we all undergo a state of unconsciousness during sleep where we dream and can not control certain things in the dream . but this seems to be an extension of dreaming where your brain becomes out of sync with your body . i EMOFEARNEGATIVE this may something to do with EMONEGATIVE and mental health problems
this story i have read was heart breaking ! two men were shot , one twice in the EMODISGUST and the other shot in the back . EMONEGATIVESADNESS no weapons were recovered and no arrests were made causing me to EMOANTICIPATIONFEARNEGATIVESADNESS the person that did this is free . this upsets me EMONEGATIVESADNESS for myself and others , hoping to EMOPOSITIVE the EMOPOSITIVE from the EMOANGERDISGUSTFEARNEGATIVE EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVE man still at large . the two men were taken to the hospital , hoping for a EMOPOSITIVE EMOPOSITIVE for them and EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST for their families after this EMONEGATIVE EMOSURPRISE ! the terrible EMOANTICIPATION they must all be going through now . EMOANTICIPATIONFEARNEGATIVESADNESS and stressing over this EMOANGERDISGUSTFEARNEGATIVE situation . i sure do hope the person EMOPOSITIVETRUST is EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST and arrested quickly , to keep our EMOPOSITIVE EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST from additional attacks and to to get him the help he needs . not to mention EMOANTICIPATION in EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS . certainly right
it 's a EMODISGUSTNEGATIVE ironic twist that once illegal animals are seized they may fare EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS than if the smugglers were allowed to get away with them . it brings out the EMONEGATIVE of humans and their EMONEGATIVESADNESS to EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST this EMOJOYPOSITIVESURPRISETRUST world with its other inhabitants . these animals should be properly cared for , and perhaps some of the financing could come from fines imposed upon the people who illegally absconded with them in the first place .
i think that this is a EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST of funny story . i EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST EMOFEARNEGATIVE about EMOFEAR animals from the zoo for some EMOPOSITIVE . if you think about it the zoo is just one big animal EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS . i am sure that i would EMOANGERNEGATIVE the EMOTRUST of being locked up if i was a EMONEGATIVESURPRISE animal . some of these animals have never known the difference .
it seems EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST EMOANGERANTICIPATIONNEGATIVE to me that a EMOTRUST that was off could just turn itself back on . i 'm sure somebody either EMOSURPRISE turned it on or do it on purpose . that sounds like a really awful way to go though being crushed like that . they better come up with some better safety requirements to make sure that does n't EMOANTICIPATION to anybody ever again .
i remember how hard i was to my mother especially in my EMONEGATIVEPOSITIVE . it can be rough and now i see that instead of how it use to be . as a kid you always think that you know what is best that you are number one . you do n't really think about other people and their feelings and you tend to EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVE and just be this EMOANGERDISGUSTFEARNEGATIVE version of yourself .
" looks like a lot of muslim hate crimes are going on , especially in new york city . a lady had her clothes set on EMOFEAR right in EMOANTICIPATIONPOSITIVE . people yelling " " get out of america " " at them , etc . i can understand people 's animosity towards them as their religious people essentially declared EMOFEARNEGATIVE on us , but not everyone is that extreme . "
i wonder if i recognize this guy . i have n't heard of him up until now . he was just a little before our EMOANTICIPATION , although i 'm sure he had an impact on many of the people we know . it seems like he influenced many other comedians that i know . i EMOANTICIPATION on looking up his work to see what is out there of him .
the article i read was about the EMOANGERDISGUSTNEGATIVESADNESS in responsibility for birth control between men and women . a new male birth control was EMONEGATIVE as having too many side effects on men , when options available to women have far more and more severe side effects . the article mentioned that birth control for women revolutionized lives so much that the side effects were deemed EMOPOSITIVE , but men are not accustomed to ceding EMOPOSITIVE for responsibility , are used to women taking control in this area .
i was EMOPOSITIVE about a dad who EMONEGATIVESADNESS his EMOJOYPOSITIVE in the charlie headboard attacks in paris . it was touching . i mean , it was EMOSADNESS , him talking about EMOANGERNEGATIVESADNESS her and those feeling , as well as those of other people who lived it . but his story EMONEGATIVE me . he was talking about all the notes he EMOPOSITIVE and how there was such an outpouring . he wrote a book , and he 's EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST . nice to see theirs some form of EMOPOSITIVE after something so awful
micheal moore was right about this . EMOSURPRISE could and did win . the more we dismissed him the stronger he got . i ca n't stand his attitude and his EMONEGATIVE of EMOFEARPOSITIVE . but i can understand how he won . voters were fed up with the EMOPOSITIVE lifetime politicians . i think hillary EMONEGATIVESADNESS the election more than EMOSURPRISE won it . a lot of people did n't EMOTRUST her and wanted a EMOFEAR . now good or bad we have EMOFEAR .
megan kelly during an interview , repeatedly EMOFEARNEGATIVE his finger at her and EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVE her of being “ fascinated with EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST ” because she brought up allegations of sexual EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVE against EMOSURPRISE . in a EMOANGERNEGATIVE tone , gingrich tried to tell kelly which EMOANGERNEGATIVE she could or could not use . gingrich once had a EMOPOSITIVE of his own with bill clinton ’s EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST life , as he was a driving EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVE behind the movement to EMODISGUSTFEARNEGATIVE clinton following a consensual sexual relationship he had with a EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVESURPRISE former intern . clinton became the second EMOPOSITIVETRUST in american history to be impeached by the house , but he was acquitted by the EMOTRUST . voters , meanwhile , punished the republicans for what they saw as an overreach : the gop EMONEGATIVESADNESS five house seats in the 1998 midterm elections , which led to gingrich ’s EMONEGATIVESADNESSSURPRISE as speaker .
this article about the murder / EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS of this couple just further proves that people who commit acts of murder are usually mentally EMOANGERNEGATIVESADNESS . they will EMOFEARNEGATIVE someone and themselves with or without access to a EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVE . this murder / EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS was clearly not done by a EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVE . there are so many situations where a murderer will EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS themselves after they have harmed someone else , proving that they are very EMOANGERNEGATIVESADNESS and they should have EMOPOSITIVE help of some sort . this will EMOFEAR them from harming EMOPOSITIVETRUST people along with themselves .
i ca n't believe that this happened . can you imagine what it must be like to EMOFEARNEGATIVE from something so incredibly EMOFEARNEGATIVE and then lose your life at EMOPOSITIVE or see people EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS while you 're escaping ? i wonder sometimes what must EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST refugees to do this . is there no other way for them to EMOANTICIPATIONFEARNEGATIVEPOSITIVE ? why do they EMOANTICIPATIONFEARNEGATIVE their lives when they know the EMOPOSITIVE of people who EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS in situations like this ? it must be awful where they are EMOANTICIPATION from for them to EMOANTICIPATIONFEARNEGATIVE it all . i mean , look at that EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST soccer EMONEGATIVE . she was like EMOPOSITIVE in her country and a EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVE EMOPOSITIVE . if even she took the EMOANTICIPATIONFEARNEGATIVE and died , what must it be like for other people ?
it makes me sad to think of this man who was mentally EMOFEARNEGATIVESURPRISE attacking people . i wonder sometimes how many attacks are attributed to terrorists when in reality the people might just be mentally ill . i wish we had a better EMOTRUST for treating mental EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS in our country instead of locking people away .
friends and family - we need to pray for those people in taiwan . they have just been EMOANGERNEGATIVE by yet another EMOFEARNEGATIVE . this has left their country in quite the run down state . people are EMONEGATIVE effected in this country and need our thoughts and prayers . we also need to pray for china due to the EMOFEARNEGATIVE heading there next .
oh my god ... i ca n't even imagine the EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVE those two poor boys must have felt . i can only hope they did not see it EMOANTICIPATION . how EMOANGERNEGATIVESADNESS must one be to see this sort of thing as the only way out , the right thing to do ? the EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS and EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS this family is feeling is probably only compounded due to the EMONEGATIVE feelings of someone you EMOJOYPOSITIVE committing such an EMOANGERDISGUSTNEGATIVE act on others you EMOJOYPOSITIVE , whose lives were just beginning . poor babies ... i do hope they did n't EMONEGATIVE . it shows that complaints of domestic issues should be taken seriously , by everyone . it states he was under EMOANTICIPATION / being sought for domestic violations . how did he even get his hands on those boys ? it 's so sad .
this article about a firecracker going off during a protest is about the stupidest thing i have seen in a while . the journalists are pond EMODISGUSTNEGATIVE trying desperately to write anything they can to divide people up . college kids ca n't EMOANGERFEAR a firecracker going off , they need to EMOTRUST mandatory EMOFEAR service like israel does , then maybe they would not be scared chickens EMONEGATIVESADNESS about everything .
if you have gone through EMOFEARNEGATIVE , gone through hell , you should EMOANTICIPATIONPOSITIVESURPRISETRUST that when you come home to the country that you have been EMOANGERNEGATIVE to EMOPOSITIVE that they will take care of you in some way instead of throwing you out into the EMONEGATIVE and basically tell you good EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVESURPRISE . it is heartbreaking to know people out there are in poverty , but especially to know that our EMOFEARNEGATIVE veterans are treated this way .
this article reminds me of an EMOSURPRISE that happened when i was a teenager . my step dad worked at a power plant and there was some EMONEGATIVE EMOFEARNEGATIVESURPRISE and three people died . one of them was the EMOTRUST of a guy i knew from EMOTRUST . i had heard his head was crushed . it was very disturbing imagery and it has stuck with me since . i EMOANTICIPATIONFEARNEGATIVESADNESS about my husband EMOPOSITIVE in a EMOFEARNEGATIVE EMOPOSITIVE , too , but it seems generally a lot of guys EMOPOSITIVE in these places are n't following safety rules and that 's how the accidents EMOANTICIPATION .
i just read this article about a wolf being killed after EMOPOSITIVE 700 miles by a EMOFEARNEGATIVE agent . i do n't understand it ! there was no EMOPOSITIVE for it . it had n't attacked or EMOANGERNEGATIVESADNESS anyone so what was the point of it all ? i feel like anymore people just EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS animals to EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS . this is why one day so these animals will be EMONEGATIVESADNESS . i think that it should be against the EMOTRUST to EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS any animal that has n't put you in EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS in and way ! this is not ok ! this needs to stop ! i am disgusted by it all !
it 's always sad to hear about someone(s ) dying especially there are children involved , luckily only adults were killed according to the article and the children survived but it 's emotional , physical , and mentally hard for the children to EMOPOSITIVE to it . maybe the adults were there parents and watching somebody EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS your own family members is heart - wrenching . my EMOJOYPOSITIVE and prayers go out for the kids
this is awful ! i just read that a family EMONEGATIVESADNESS two family pets and their home due to a EMOANGERDISGUSTFEARNEGATIVE EMOFEAR , still in EMOANTICIPATION ! this is one of those times when i let my mind wander and i think , what is going to EMOANTICIPATION to them ? where would they sleep at night ? and the EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS they must feel for not having the pets , and a place to call their own .
a EMOFEAR EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS a family 's house . the people EMOFEAR and suffered no EMOFEARNEGATIVE but two of their cats died . as a EMOANTICIPATION of the EMOFEAR , they are EMOANGERFEARSADNESS but at least they 're EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST . at least the red EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS is helping them out . they might be sad about the pets but i am sure they feel EMOPOSITIVE that no people died in this EMOFEAR .
i always read about these house fires and never think about them again . that is something that i should do less of . maybe i can find a way to donate EMOANTICIPATION or money for families in tragedies so that they can get back on their feet as soon as possible . this recent EMOANGERDISGUSTNEGATIVESURPRISE of my attitude was because a EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST of mine recently had their apartment burn out due to a EMOPOSITIVE EMOFEAR .
is val wilmer EMOPOSITIVE or not ? seems as though comments keep being made about his health and now michael douglas has even said something about him . although , just because the two worked together on the EMOFEAR and the EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS ( one of the best movies ever ! ) does n't give him the right to make EMOANTICIPATIONPOSITIVE comments about wilmer 's health whether it 's EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST or not . maybe he does n't want the whole world to know if he 's going through something .
i bring you sad news today , my EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST . a male wolf member of the huckleberry pack has been slaughtered . how can they do this without consequences ? this event happened in montana . i have heard similar stories in that region of wolves being gunned down , especially from helicopters . it makes my heart feel heavy . i know you will feel the same way . i am EMOPOSITIVE considering EMOPOSITIVE a EMOPOSITIVE to the EMOPOSITIVETRUST for biological diversity because they are EMOANGERNEGATIVE on behalf of wolves to stop this murder . it was so cruel because the male was simply wandering for a EMOPOSITIVETRUST . he did n't deserve what happened .
hello jane , how have you been , i want to EMOANGER out an article i read and is very heart breaking . a few families EMONEGATIVESADNESS their loved one in a ride at the dreamworld theme park in queensland , australia . they were thrown off the ride into the water . it is a very sad story and it will be investigated , also the dream world ceo has created a memorial at the park with 500 staff to attend , which is very EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST .
the article was about new global warming study.warns : desert in southern spain in the future — climate scientists from france shared a EMOPOSITIVE this week about the possible grim future awaiting the country of spain , and the earth as a whole . they EMOANTICIPATIONFEARSURPRISE that if climate EMOFEAR continues , deserts in the middle east will expand to the EMOPOSITIVE and even reach southern spain , transforming today ’s deciduous forests into EMONEGATIVESADNESS lands EMOANGERDISGUSTFEARNEGATIVE for plants and animals , and of course EMOPOSITIVE humans . last year , hundreds of countries around the globe have signed a non - binding EMOPOSITIVETRUST . known as the paris EMOPOSITIVETRUST , its EMOPOSITIVE goal is to stop global EMOFEAR by implementing and keeping EMOANTICIPATION - term solutions . the target is to keep temperature EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVE by more than 2 degrees celsius or 3.6 degrees fahrenheit
i just read about this australian hiker that was EMONEGATIVESADNESS in the malaysian EMOFEAR for two weeks and most of that EMOANTICIPATION without EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST . he was week but he survived . i 'm shocked . i 'm EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST he made it because to often you hear those stories of a EMONEGATIVESADNESS hiker and it ends tragically . his friends and family say he has a strong mental attitude , he must . i do n't think i 'd ever EMOPOSITIVE that EMOANTICIPATION especially since i do n't even know anything about EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST plants to EMOPOSITIVE like this guy must have . way to go EMOPOSITIVETRUST . way to EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVE .
hopefully this EMOANGERNEGATIVE ends soon its getting to be too much the EMONEGATIVESADNESS impact is getting bigger and bigger . if things font stop before EMOANTICIPATION then the EMOANGERNEGATIVE wo nt be in that area till spread even wider as all the larger countries get involved and the EMOANGERNEGATIVE just wo nt stop . maybe we should EMOANTICIPATION a petition or something to get some EMOPOSITIVE on this issue
regardless of what scientists believe the earth is warming . i think that people are EMOTRUST always trying to come up with reasons as to what is happening with the earth , but these people are trying to EMOPOSITIVE this lady research apart . also , i am not sure how sexual harassment plays into the article , but that is a big deal in the us . people get harassed way to often in the workplace with nothing being done .
so EMONEGATIVE and sad that this EMOFEARPOSITIVETRUST EMOPOSITIVETRUST was just doing his EMOPOSITIVE and now he 's gone and his family is left to EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS his EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS . i hope they figure out who did this and EMONEGATIVETRUST EMOPOSITIVETRUST to the fullest extent . it sounds like it could be one of the people they EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST dead , though . i EMOSURPRISE we 'll find out later .
class differences EMONEGATIVEPOSITIVE and varies how a parent raises their EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVE . middle - class parents raise their EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVE through the use of feelings and EMONEGATIVESADNESS - class parents raise their children through behavior control . middle - class parents and EMONEGATIVESADNESS - class parents raise their children to be like them feeling and behavioral EMOPOSITIVE . middle - class children get reprimanded for feeling the EMONEGATIVE way and EMONEGATIVESADNESS - class children are punished for behaving EMONEGATIVESADNESS
this really saddens me that people are so EMONEGATIVESADNESS now a days . it never solves anything to EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS other people and this just shows a EMONEGATIVE of EMOSURPRISE and EMONEGATIVESADNESS . it feels as though there had been a EMONEGATIVESADNESS with EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST and we do not have the EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST for each other that e once had . i hope that this person can find their way to a better path .
i just read an article about the attacks in a syrian town . it sounds EMOANGERDISGUSTFEARNEGATIVE what they are going through . it talks about women and children dying . i tried to imagine what it would be like to live in such horror . it mentions many post on social media of pictures and videos . i would be interested in seeing some of the pictures and videos of this EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS . EMOPOSITIVE stuff like this really makes you appreciate being in america .
we just have a EMOANTICIPATION way to go . too many times we do not believe the EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS especially if they are females . things EMOANTICIPATION to them especially now and they are EMOANTICIPATION out but we still ask for EMOTRUST when we should believe in them most and that should be more than enough EMOTRUST . we want to believe them and EMOTRUST them that we care as people and that we would do what it takes to get them the EMOPOSITIVETRUST that they deserve
do you know about erika EMONEGATIVE news ? that like dengue and west nile EMONEGATIVE , this EMOANGERDISGUSTNEGATIVE - spread disease is now going to be a regular EMOPOSITIVE — and a EMOPOSITIVETRUST EMOANTICIPATIONFEARNEGATIVE for pregnant women . the huge EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST of erika activity in the americas right now is EMOSURPRISE . a longtime us army EMOANTICIPATIONPOSITIVETRUST who is now semiretired , hal stead believes erika will EMOSURPRISE in a few years , likely for decades . that ’s the way another retrovirus , chikungunya works , he wrote in an article in emerging EMODISGUSTFEARNEGATIVESADNESS diseases last year . “ the rate at which people are getting infected right now certainly suggests that we ’re heading , within a year or two , to EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST sufficient herd immunity for this EMONEGATIVE to EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS out ,
the pipeline seems to be interfering with native american tribes and is causing lots of environmental EMOANGERDISGUSTNEGATIVESADNESS . i do feel for these individuals , and it 's EMOPOSITIVETRUST they get all the help they deserve . their ancestors were decimated throughout history and there inst enough reparations to solve the genocide that was caused .
i heard about a EMOPOSITIVE climber who died in vietnam trying to scale it 's highest EMOANTICIPATION . i remember we 've talked about going on EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVE there . EMONEGATIVESADNESS it was a EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVESURPRISE guy , 22 , not much EMOPOSITIVE than us . it 's a really EMONEGATIVE story because he was on the EMOSURPRISE with his girlfriend and when it went off on his own he became EMONEGATIVESADNESS . in his final moments they were actually in EMOPOSITIVE through testing .
i feel sad yet again to here about more crimes against the native americans . the pipeline is EMOANGERDISGUSTFEARNEGATIVE and will no EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESSTRUST EMOANTICIPATION in leaks that EMODISGUSTNEGATIVE water . it is good that people are protesting but i do n't feel it will end up EMOPOSITIVE . there is oil there and they will EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS people if they need to just like they do in every other country .
so i just read this article , a very EMOPOSITIVE one . you all need to read it to understand what it is really about . there is a way the EMOPOSITIVETRUST puts things in a very simple way for everyone to understand . i would EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST you all to find it and read it . it will be EMOPOSITIVE your EMOANTICIPATION .
EMOPOSITIVE EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST , i have just finished EMOPOSITIVE a very upsetting and EMONEGATIVE article . it told the story of a EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVESURPRISE teenage girl in india named ins ha mustache . she EMONEGATIVESADNESS her EMOANTICIPATIONPOSITIVE and 14 years old because she was shot repeatedly with pellets . she has been in and out of hospitals for months trying to regain her EMOANTICIPATIONPOSITIVE , but so far it has not been EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST . she is trying to stay positive now but she knows that she has a EMOFEAR road EMOPOSITIVE of her . i hope that she regains her sight .
i do n't know much about the issues in syria and other countries in the middle east , but i 'm not a fan of EMOFEARNEGATIVE or our place in these international conflicts . the EMOPOSITIVETRUST states has had EMOFEAR EMONEGATIVEPOSITIVE in the middle east for way too EMOANTICIPATION , and we were EMOANGERNEGATIVE by EMOPOSITIVETRUST obama at the EMOANTICIPATION he started office . he stated he would EMOPOSITIVE all troops out , but that never really happened . the troops may have decreased , but we have a strong EMOPOSITIVE there still .
take a look at this story that i EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST online . it 's about forest fires being spread out over a couple of different states , EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST EMOPOSITIVE . i know that i sent you the pictures of what was happening around here , but you might be also interested in EMOPOSITIVE this story about how it is happening all over the place .
we need to recognize that global warming is EMOPOSITIVETRUST and acknowledge our part in it . we as a globe need to take note and work together . the great EMOANGERNEGATIVE reef is one of our planet 's more amazing wonders and we need to do all we can to EMOPOSITIVE it , while the amazon is n't doing absolutely fantastic we 've EMOPOSITIVE the quality and EMOANTICIPATIONPOSITIVETRUST .
that is really sad to hear . it 's awful that cars can be so EMOFEARNEGATIVE and sometimes people EMONEGATIVE how easy it is to get into an EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESSSURPRISE if everyone is n't EMOPOSITIVE and EMOPOSITIVE . it said this happened at 6:30pm so i wonder if maybe the sun was EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVE right in someone 's eyes because that has happened to me at EMOANTICIPATIONPOSITIVE and i could barely see . it 's EMOFEAR to EMOPOSITIVE over and stop in those conditions as well .
wow - what a EMOJOYPOSITIVESURPRISE EMOFEARTRUST ! ! i ca n't believe he was able to stop that guy . the EMOPOSITIVE is much better off without him . as EMOPOSITIVE as i find EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST EMOANGERNEGATIVE , i really do n't understand the impulse of some people to EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS . it 's EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS . i ca n't believe the EMOANGERDISGUSTNEGATIVESADNESS that guy caused . luckily , he was stopped ! !
i think we all need to do a better EMOPOSITIVE of taking care of are forest and water ways because we rely on these to EMOPOSITIVE and if we are EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS animals and fish the EMONEGATIVE way and they EMOANTICIPATION to go away it could have a big impact on us and by that EMOANTICIPATION it could be to EMONEGATIVESADNESS to do anything about it . so we need to put laws in that will help the animals but also help allow us to fish for them the right way not by taking a shortcut
you know i 'm not a fan of EMOTRUST in any context , but this type of thing happens everywhere . there 's always some EMODISGUSTNEGATIVE who goes off and uses EMOTRUST , bigotry , EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST , gender , anything really as an explanation . it 's sad that you read something like this and it does n't even feel like news . perhaps its just our access that 's making this seem ordinary .
just came across an article that involves shootings and people being killed . the story is about a EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST person in his 50 's if i am not mistaking that was bothered by the loud EMOJOYPOSITIVESADNESS that was playing in a duran go by some EMONEGATIVESADNESS teenagers at a gas station in florida . there was an EMOANGERNEGATIVE regarding the EMOJOYPOSITIVESADNESS and some EMOPOSITIVETRUST of EMOANGERNEGATIVE . the EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST guy shot the 17 year old EMONEGATIVESADNESS kid 6 times . he was convicted for life with the EMOANTICIPATION of EMOANTICIPATION after 2 years . he was EMONEGATIVESADNESS . these situations are EMONEGATIVE and they are happening quite often lately . there should be a limit on many things , and one of them should be the guns . there should be a stricter EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVE control .
i like we EMOANTICIPATIONPOSITIVESURPRISETRUST turkey to EMOPOSITIVETRUST its parliamentary EMOPOSITIVE , EMOPOSITIVE EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST for human rights and the EMOFEARTRUST of EMOTRUST , and we are conveying these expectations directly to the turkish authorities , ” gathering said in a EMOPOSITIVETRUST with the eu ’s enlargement commissioner , erdoğan has launched repeated EMOTRUST attacks on demirtaş , who analysts have seen as the sole politician in turkey who comes anywhere near to rivaling his charisma . demirtaş has made it a EMOTRUST EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVE to EMONEGATIVE erdoğan ’s EMOANTICIPATION for a presidential EMOTRUST in turkey , which the hp says would EMOPOSITIVE to dictatorship .
i ca n't imagine what it must have been like for the people who were caught up in this , how EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS they must have felt . not having any recourse for so EMOANTICIPATION , no one doing anything to right the wrongs , just feeling like it 's ok for you to be abused and for it to go on for so EMOANTICIPATION and EMOANTICIPATION to so many people . maybe they feel some EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST of EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVESADNESS now though .
EMOPOSITIVE out is EMOPOSITIVETRUST , but you may want to check the ingredients of the supplements you take . this article talks about a number of ingredients that can cause EMOFEARNEGATIVE side effects and are also very common in work out supplements . it 's scary to think about what we are putting in our body . from now on , i am probably going to cut back and go more natural .
did you hear about the earthquake in tanzania ? there were over 200 deaths . it 's so scary because you ca n't really EMOANTICIPATIONPOSITIVE for something like that . i live in california so people are always EMOFEAR us about the san andres EMONEGATIVESADNESS line . i get so EMONEGATIVESADNESS thinking about how bad it might get if something like that happens to us .
i 'm EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVE that they finally put an end to this mans EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS EMONEGATIVE . i 'm not sure why he did what he did but he was obviously mentally ill and was n't taking his medication . i believe friends had to have been helping him EMOFEAR otherwise i do n't know how he could have EMONEGATIVE so EMOANTICIPATION otherwise . anyways , incidents like this only makes them try to EMONEGATIVE down harder on guns and our rights to EMOANGERFEAR arms , but this person was clearly mentally ill .
it 's always sad when you lose the legends no matter what . for one it makes you feel old but for two you lose any future of their work . it is also sad for the family who loses a loved one and is hard to imagine the responsibility of keeping up the name of the EMOPOSITIVE person they 've EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS . i mean how do you know what they would do with the rights of their EMOJOYPOSITIVESADNESS or if you should even use them anymore ?
hey what s going on jacob ? i want to tell EMOANGER out something i read in this article . there was a saudi - led EMOPOSITIVE that is backed by the us , they had led an EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVE in yemen , that had killed around 43 people . this is sad to hear so much EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS in this world . according to what i read this happened because they are trying to take someone out of power and they are trying to bring in a new EMOPOSITIVETRUST , i think his name is abed rambo man EMODISGUSTNEGATIVE . the usa wants to put him in there . also they are more people dying from the EMOANTICIPATION EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS , people are EMONEGATIVE and also planes had attacked a EMOSADNESS place and they had killed people there as well . all this necessary EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS is not good for this EMOPOSITIVETRUST . this is really , really bad that we need EMOFEARNEGATIVE to solve problems .
wow , can you believe he survived in the EMOFEAR that EMOANTICIPATION on his own ? it is amazing what the human body is capable of hey ? i remember the last EMOANTICIPATION i went a couple days without EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST and it was so intense . people think they are EMOANTICIPATION to EMOPOSITIVE in the EMONEGATIVESURPRISE but we really have so few skills to get EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST for ourselves without the right tools . it 's amazing that he was EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST after all that EMOANTICIPATION . i wonder how EMOANTICIPATION it will take for him to recover ?
this article greatly disturbs me . the EMOTRUST that we treat muslims and people of their EMOPOSITIVE like dogs and terrorist is EMOANGERDISGUSTFEARNEGATIVE and EMONEGATIVE both morally and ethically . the way they are being shown on tv and media is EMONEGATIVE and EMOANGERDISGUSTFEARNEGATIVE . our EMOPOSITIVETRUST thinks that if we EMONEGATIVE muslims from the country , all of a EMOSURPRISE our EMOTRUST is EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST . when the EMOTRUST of the matter is , most shootings that EMOANTICIPATION in this country , are from caucasians . muslims are shown in bad light due to some extremist and they do not deserve this treatment .
i feel so sad for the world . the world needs a revolution and good people in charge of the countries . bad people need to EMOFEAR from this world , we need specials EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVE to deal with EMOANGERNEGATIVE from this world . a lot of people is in EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS because of different beliefs , race , EMOPOSITIVE and bad presidents . people around the world should have the same opportunities to be EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST and have a EMOPOSITIVE life . i would like to help every EMOANGERNEGATIVE in the world . big countries in the would should help all the people that are EMODISGUSTFEARNEGATIVESADNESS because of EMOANGERNEGATIVE . i can see a lot of EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS around the world and i just can say that a lot of people with EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST are extremely EMOANGERDISGUSTNEGATIVE . we need powerful people dealing with this EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST of situations . on the other hand , people should make EMOFEAR isis from the map asap .
that 's really strange that people would make such a big deal about her being single and running for office . that seems really EMONEGATIVE , i wish people would EMOPOSITIVE all their EMOPOSITIVE on the EMOPOSITIVETRUST issues when it comes to EMOANGER . it seemed like the rules for moldova did n't consider that a single person might run , i think they should update it .
a man has took it on himself to EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS evasive mice that have doubled in size on an island . the mice feed on birds and when the birds have babies its like a EMOANGERNEGATIVE for them to thrive on . i imagine it must be EMOANGERDISGUSTFEARNEGATIVE to have so many mice doing what they please and EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS other animals . it gives me the creeps thinking about it .
z did you hear ? ? kate unsaleable and len EMOPOSITIVE man EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS up ! ! ! ! i ca n't believe it . what happened ? i 'm EMONEGATIVESADNESS . at least they do n't have any kids so they do n't have to put them through that whole thing about divorce . but i mean come on , she can barely even EMOANTICIPATIONNEGATIVE to get back out there , without her wedding ring ? ? ? jeez . sad .
i just read an article about 500 people being killed in an earthquake . i feel so EMOJOYPOSITIVE that i live in a state where i do n’t EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVE earthquakes , or severe EMOFEAR warnings , flash floods or EMOPOSITIVE disasters . of course vermont has had our issues and weather events that caused EMOANGERDISGUSTNEGATIVESADNESS , however we ’re not in a region of the world where we EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVE for our lives at certain months of the year . i could not imagine being terrified for my children , property , and family like some of these families are . living through an experience like that , must EMONEGATIVESADNESSSURPRISE behind emotional scars while growing up .
you know how you were having trouble sleeping ? here , read about people who have tinnitus - it 'll put you to sleep . i feel like more should be done to help the seven percent who say their tinnitus is a big EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS for them , though . that 's the same as any other psychiatric EMOANGERNEGATIVE , right ? if it 's affecting your life so that you ca n't function normally , there should be some EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST of help for you
since EMOSURPRISE became EMOPOSITIVETRUST it has been clear that people who are racist , misogynist , and sexist people have been EMOFEAR , probably because society overall expresses these things as a bad thing . but since they see a EMOPOSITIVETRUST that is like them , it gives them fuel to be bad people in EMOANTICIPATIONPOSITIVE and even are EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST of it . i just hate EMOSURPRISE and everything about him as well as his supporters .
what i learned about this situation was that sometimes life is not EMOPOSITIVE . seeing this EMODISGUSTNEGATIVE trapped in a place for 4 days is terrible . his poor body tried to EMOPOSITIVE and EMOANGERNEGATIVE on for EMOPOSITIVE life but children are not exempt from this life . to think about that kid in that position makes me sad . his family is the one that suffers unfortunately .
another example of the EMOFEARNEGATIVE EMONEGATIVE for the indian people who lived here before we ever arrived . sad in this day and age they are just trying to EMOPOSITIVE their EMOPOSITIVE . stop the potential for environmental EMOANGERDISGUSTNEGATIVESADNESS to the EMOPOSITIVE where they have lived for thousands of years . do n't we EMOPOSITIVE anything from history . how can they shot and EMOFEARNEGATIVE these people just EMOPOSITIVETRUST their EMOPOSITIVE and way of life .
istanbul , have you heard what is going on over near turkey ? man i am not even really sure myself but it sounds EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST messed up . at least eight members of EMOTRUST were charged with some type terrorism - EMOTRUST crimes . this is just sickening to me . turkey ’s EMOTRUST voted to EMONEGATIVESADNESS lawmakers of their immunity
EMOSURPRISE refuses to take a EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST from the EMOFEARNEGATIVE for being EMOPOSITIVETRUST . well he is rich so $ 400,000 is probably nothing to him . its saving the EMOFEARNEGATIVE but that would probably be the only smart move he s made since he s been in the EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST house period . in not a EMOSURPRISE EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST but i like the idea that he chose to EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST the EMOFEARNEGATIVE money .
EMOPOSITIVE this article makes me EMOANGERNEGATIVESADNESS . i hate what we do to native people . it seems as a society we seem to EMONEGATIVE their feelings and traditions just to move ourselves EMOPOSITIVE . we EMONEGATIVE that we intruded onto their EMOPOSITIVE to make ourselves homes that we EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST yet we ca n't EMOPOSITIVE them the same good feeling . to even think that the EMOPOSITIVE of having EMOFEARNEGATIVE amounts of mercury seep into the waters is beyond me .
" a little animal called the aquitaine is an EMOFEARNEGATIVE species . efforts are being made to EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST the species but many EMOANTICIPATIONPOSITIVETRUST groups do not think these efforts will be EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST . they call it " " quick fix " " intervention . usually , when efforts are made to EMOPOSITIVE a species , the efforts are EMONEGATIVESADNESS . apparently these animals are EMONEGATIVE porpoises which get trapped in nets . "
you know i EMOJOYPOSITIVE playing devil 's EMOTRUST and having random views on things . well here 's another one of my EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS ideas so EMOANTICIPATIONPOSITIVE yourself . i think that the EMOPOSITIVE of sacramento is EMOJOYPOSITIVE that 's all that happened to him . yes he may be EMOANGERNEGATIVESADNESS and a little shaken , but he still gets to go home to his family and EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST his EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST . he does n't lose his EMOPOSITIVE and he is n't majorly damaged . i would easily take a pie in the face if afterwards i was a rich EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST man who still had supporters behind me .
that 's EMOPOSITIVE about the buzzing possibly being created by the brain . i always EMOANTICIPATION it was created by the auditory EMOPOSITIVE . someone very close to me deals with tinnitus every day , and i always EMOANTICIPATION it was odd because i 'm the one who has worked in high EMONEGATIVE environments , but she 's the one who suffers with it . it 's EMOPOSITIVE because it says psychotherapy is a possible EMOPOSITIVE which would make us very EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST if it 's EMOPOSITIVETRUST .
did you hear about the EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS in egypt ? unfortunately it looks like fifty five people have died . it 's such a sad story . i feel so bad for the families and that has to be a odd feeling for the 150 or so that survived . so many people swam to EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST their lives . i would never be able to do that ! there were also children on the boat , so that is incredibly sad . i hate that people died and had no EMOSURPRISE of survival .
i 'm not sure how to feel about animals that are considered as abused when being used for entertainment purposes . it gives us the EMOANTICIPATIONPOSITIVE to EMOPOSITIVE and see them up close but at the same EMOANTICIPATION its hard to handle the EMOTRUST that these animals might be feeling EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS . i mean imagine being EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS by monkeys your whole life so they can introduce them to humans . would be sad .
honestly i do feel bad for him but at the same EMOANTICIPATION you should not be taking a EMOANGERDISGUSTNEGATIVE around an animal that is clearly so EMOFEARNEGATIVE . pythons are really EMOFEARNEGATIVE animals and i get that the man had rescued the reptile from a local hotel but even still , you need to have your eyes on that thing at all times . i feel like some people are not as EMOPOSITIVETRUST as they should be , and that goes for anything . people are too busy spending their life looking through the viewfinder of their smartphone camera and are so busy trying to document everything online in their EMONEGATIVE , never ending EMOANTICIPATIONPOSITIVE for more likes and followers that they are willing to put their EMOTRUST safety on the line , and that 's really sad and i think it really speaks to where we 're going as a society as well , and it 's frustrating .
i am so bothered and EMOANGERNEGATIVESADNESS about the elementary EMOTRUST EMOPOSITIVETRUST that was charged with EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVE EMODISGUSTNEGATIVE . i can not believe a trusted individual would commit such a EMONEGATIVE EMOANGERNEGATIVE involving children ! this infuriates me to my EMOPOSITIVE that someone could EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS EMOPOSITIVETRUST children this way ! does this make you just as mad ? i really feel for those parents of the children involved and hope that it does not do permanent EMOANGERDISGUSTNEGATIVESADNESS to all those sweet babies !
you mean you ca n't breathe in smog and EMODISGUSTNEGATIVE and walk away EMOPOSITIVE ? who knew ? ! this article states so much obviousness , that you would hope people were already aware of these issues . you have cancer ? well , you had better move away from that smog bowl you live in ! india and china are both owners of some nasty smog infested cities . not EMOSURPRISE .
so sad ! the middle east just keeps getting EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS . i hate what ’s happening to these people , but i ’m not sure how to solve it . i wish there was a simple , easy fix . however , it seems like every EMOANTICIPATION we try to fix something it just gets EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS . it ’s such a complex situation with no easy answer . unfortunately , i do n’t see it being solved any EMOANTICIPATION soon .
josh , i just read about the calais EMOSADNESS camp that was set up in france to house the people from syria that the EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVE EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS his own people drove away . the EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS with all of this is the country of syria must come to a place where they take back what has been taken from them . but you know why they ca n't ? the citizens were not allowed to be EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVEPOSITIVE and any weapons they have now have been supplied by us and the allies . EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST example as to why our founders wrote the second amendment .
this article talks about pouching in africa . it 's really sad EMOFEARNEGATIVE about the rhinos . we need to EMOPOSITIVE these animals . these animals are more EMOPOSITIVETRUST that the people poaching them . those poachers deserve to EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS ; they are EMOANGERDISGUSTFEARNEGATIVE people and they are EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS a EMOPOSITIVESURPRISE species . this is a terrible thing . they desperately need to EMOPOSITIVE these poor rhinos from people .
this is troubling as it is unusual to have two people EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS of this cause at the same EMOANTICIPATION . this seems EMOANGERANTICIPATIONNEGATIVE as well . i hope the authorities can find some answers so this EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS is not repeated . i hope the family can eventually find some EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST and get the EMOPOSITIVE they need for EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVESADNESS on their EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS .
so , a man in china , put a chopstick into his penis . yeah , you heard me . he wanted to see if he had an EMOFEARNEGATIVE or something , and instead of being a normal person , and going to the EMOPOSITIVETRUST , he decided to self examine and see what he could find . he ended up having to have EMOFEARSADNESS to EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS the chopstick out of his penis . what would EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST a man , to do such a thing ? , the only thing i can think of after EMOPOSITIVE this story , , is about how EMOPOSITIVETRUST mental EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS is .. there is no other EMONEGATIVE in my opinion on why someone so masochistic . i mean , the doctors said , any further , and he would have killed himself . it hurts me just thinking about this .
this breaks my heart . i mean , i know there 's trouble everywhere , but these people have absolutely no hope , and the EMOPOSITIVETRUST states caused this , so we EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST responsibility . i 'm going to look around and see which EMOSADNESS organizations are trying to help , and gather EMOPOSITIVE EMOPOSITIVE . are you in ? i 'll see if alan wants to bring this up at EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST , too .
this is just EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS , you have to feel for the mother , but at the same EMOANTICIPATION what EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST of apartment has that many violations and is still not punished . they need to EMOANGERNEGATIVESADNESS them and anybody involved with this . i ca nt believe that in today 's society that tragedies like this are tolerated . somebody needs to go to EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS for the death of this little girl and the injuries that her mother suffered . i ca nt imagine what the mother is going through and she probably blames herself . things like this should just not EMOANTICIPATION .
this is just such a sad situation . i wish they had been able to find out more when they investigated , but i EMOSURPRISE they ca n't always get it right . i really feel for the EMOTRUST . he did what he could to stop his son and he was n't able to . it reminds me of a certain person i know whose family member was involved in a different EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST of violent extremism . sometimes people you EMOJOYPOSITIVE go on terrible paths and you do n't have enough EMOPOSITIVE to do anything until it 's too EMONEGATIVESADNESS .
this article is so EMOFEARNEGATIVESURPRISE . the EMOTRUST that many indonesians are n't EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST in their own home country is very EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVE . a lot of people ca n't EMOPOSITIVE to EMONEGATIVESADNESSSURPRISE , so they 're stuck risking their lives because of this EMOFEARNEGATIVE , which is nothing that they can do anything about . a lot of EMOPOSITIVETRUST people are getting a raw deal , here .
i just read about the EMONEGATIVE of the women from that national geographic magazine . you know , the one with the EMOPOSITIVE EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST eyes . she 's in her 40s now , and she was just arrested for staying illegally in pakistan . if worst comes to worst , she could be put in EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS for 14 years or deported back to the place she was trying to EMOANTICIPATIONFEARNEGATIVEPOSITIVE . it breaks my heart to see refugees who are just looking for a EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST place to live being at EMOANTICIPATIONFEARNEGATIVE for EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS .
showing just how amazing females have been doing especially in sports . it makes you wonder just how hard they have been EMOPOSITIVE and becoming role models for EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVESURPRISE girls . that they would do whatever it took to become something and people like rounds rouse and how much she achieved just shows what it means to be a EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST .
i just read this article about EMOPOSITIVE lenses . it has some good EMOPOSITIVE about the risks associated with improper EMONEGATIVETRUST of contacts . i ca n't believe there are some people who EMOANTICIPATIONPOSITIVE their lenses in tap water . EMODISGUSTNEGATIVE ! i definitely make it a point to not EMONEGATIVETRUST my lenses over the 30 day limit and i try to never EMONEGATIVESADNESS asleep in wearing them .
it ’s a sad day when EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVESURPRISE kids are EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS themselves . they act on impulse and do not realize that their actions have lasting consequences . if someone was just their to listen to these kids a lot of this probably would’t be happening . its just so sad especially for the parents and grandparents but also for the whole family .
hey , so i just read about this EMOFEAR in arizona . it was not super serious and no one besides one person needed to go to the hospital . it was not like super EMONEGATIVE but it just makes me think about my own life . it also makes me really think about my living situation . i have never EMOANTICIPATION about how i live in an apartment EMOPOSITIVE shared with several other people and that their actions could have severe consequences . for example , say someone above me has a EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVE who is playing with the stove and the parents are EMONEGATIVE . i EMOFEAR could EMOANTICIPATION and all of that is beyond my control . it really freaks me out now that i know someone besides just myself could EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS my home or EMOTRUST belongings . even EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS , someone could lose their life .
i read an article today that was discussing the problems with sudan in africa . the article was EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST of hard to follow , but it seems like there is a lot of political and EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST keeping discourse there . i really feel terrible for all the EMOPOSITIVETRUST people that are caught up in silly power plays and EMOFEARNEGATIVE issues . people 's lives are being ruined and EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS every day .
there was just a 5.0 earthquake in oklahoma . fortunately , no one was EMONEGATIVESADNESS EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS . i did n't even know they had earthquakes there . it must be very scary to have to go through one of those . i 'm EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVE we do n't have them here . we used to have drills at EMOTRUST , in the event of an earthquake , but that just seems like a EMODISGUSTNEGATIVE of EMOANTICIPATION . i 've never even been through one .
did you hear the story about the orangutan named diana ? she was illegally captured with , i think , three others . these animals are becoming EMONEGATIVESADNESS . the good news is , though , that she was saved . when she was EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST she was EMONEGATIVE and partially paralyzed , due to meningitis , i sure because she was n't being taken care of . i do n't understand how people can treat these EMOJOYPOSITIVE animals so EMONEGATIVE . it really make me sad .
the research EMOTRUST from australia ’s EMOANTICIPATIONPOSITIVE of queensland said the earth has EMONEGATIVESADNESS nearly 1.3 million square miles of EMOANTICIPATIONFEARSADNESS . they’be defined EMOANTICIPATIONFEARSADNESS as an area with no human development . dr. james watson of the EMOANTICIPATIONPOSITIVE of queensland in australia said globally EMOPOSITIVETRUST EMOANTICIPATIONFEARSADNESS areas are EMOPOSITIVE ignored in environmental EMOTRUST , and much has been paid to the EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS of species . without any policies to EMOPOSITIVE them , they are “ EMONEGATIVESADNESS EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS to EMOPOSITIVE development , ” he added . dr. watson also revealed that EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST has one to two decades to turn things around . to date , the world has a total of 30.1 million km2 , or around 20 percent of the world ’s EMOPOSITIVE area , that remain as EMOANTICIPATIONFEARSADNESS , with the EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST being located in countries in north america , north asia , australia and north
it 's about EMOANTICIPATION ! i really support them doing this petition . i hope that they take it seriously and are able to liberate the saudi women who have been oppressed for so EMOANTICIPATION . you would never see that EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST of EMOPOSITIVE / EMOPOSITIVETRUST EMOTRUST in places like the EMOPOSITIVETRUST states . maybe feminism really is sparking EMOFEAR around the world .
rhinos are going EMONEGATIVESADNESS , and it s a EMOPOSITIVETRUST EMODISGUSTFEARNEGATIVESADNESS since they do nothing to EMOFEARNEGATIVE human life . they are a majestic EMODISGUSTFEARNEGATIVE with much to EMOPOSITIVE . however , they are being killed because of poachers and their horn . the EMONEGATIVESADNESS rhino is almost EMONEGATIVESADNESS . only about five thousand still exist in the world today , and this is a EMOPOSITIVETRUST EMODISGUSTFEARNEGATIVESADNESS .
i EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST this article that was really sad about these divers that they EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST dead in a florida cave EMOTRUST . it was so sad . i was really EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS after EMOPOSITIVE it . perhaps they should n't have gone so far down because there was a sign saying not to , but still , it was very sad that they died . they were EMOPOSITIVETRUST and should have survived , but they did n't . i really feel sorry for their friends and family . they will be dearly missed . please pray for them and their families .
did you see all of that stuff going on over in syria and how donald EMOSURPRISE in EMOPOSITIVE with the russian EMOPOSITIVETRUST to EMOFEAR EMOANGERNEGATIVE the people over there ? man , they really have it EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST bad with all of the stuff going on . i feel really bad for the people who are living there that really do n't want any part of what is going on . could you imagine having EMOPOSITIVE and a EMOFEAR comes EMOFEARPOSITIVE over your house ? i am definitely EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVE i live where i live .
i just read an article about two us EMOFEAR personals being shot in jordan . i have so many emotions running through me . i am sad about the EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS of lives . i am in disbelief . how could this EMOANTICIPATION ? the article said they do not believe it was a roster EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVE so that makes me feel relieved , but still EMONEGATIVESADNESS . us is there to EMOPOSITIVETRUST jordan for training . why our are people being attacked ? ! the article said they failed to stop at the entrance so i do not know if maybe it was a miscommunication . i am confused to what actually happened . from what i read there was an EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVE on jordan when they just drove and barreled through their border so they are on high alert . my heart goes out to all of those involved and i am sad . but why on earth would they think that the us EMOFEAR EMOTRUST are EMOANTICIPATIONPOSITIVETRUST
hey , i wanted to EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST this article with you that i just EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST . it is about the issue with EMONEGATIVE EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST ads and targeting kids . we were talking about this the other day . well apparently it will not be ending any EMOANTICIPATION soon . it is a billion dollar industry and there is very little anyone can do about it . there are organizations out there that is trying to EMOFEAR this and EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVE against EMOJOYPOSITIVE EMODISGUSTNEGATIVESADNESS . the who organization is blaming video bloggers / bloggers who get paychecks from EMONEGATIVE EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST companies . they are claiming that they are more powerful than ads . i 'm not sure i believe that but it could be possible , you think ?
i 'm always EMOANGERNEGATIVESADNESS to hear about EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS erupting as a EMOANTICIPATION of lives EMONEGATIVESADNESS due to EMOFEARPOSITIVETRUST EMOPOSITIVE . i believe most EMOFEARPOSITIVETRUST officers are good people , but there is a pervasive issue of racism ingrained in many EMOFEARPOSITIVETRUST departments . the protests were certainly justified . EMOFEARPOSITIVETRUST should be EMONEGATIVESADNESS to psychological testing to determine whether they have an inclination toward racism . those that do need to be removed from active duty EMOANTICIPATIONNEGATIVEPOSITIVE .
i know that you are an animal EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST like i am . it really bothers me that individuals open up zoos and do n't really care about the animals . it is EMOJOYPOSITIVESURPRISETRUST that an organization was available to take these animals out of the zoo near the gaza EMONEGATIVESADNESS . i will not be going to any zoos anytime soon . how about you ? animals need to be free , not stared at and yelled at by little children . they deserve space . for now on when someone asks me to go to a zoo , my answer is noon !
global warming and fires and now being considered to be linked to one another . while being a EMOPOSITIVE of california , this to me is not EMOSURPRISE . unfortunately we as a EMOTRUST need to open our eyes up and realize the impact that we are having on our environment . even EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS is now we have a EMOPOSITIVETRUST who in his own EMOANGERNEGATIVE feel as though global warming is just a EMONEGATIVETRUST . this is going to cost us more money in the EMOFEAR EMOANGERNEGATIVE department and we are going to see way EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS side affects from this EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS .
hello EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST , have you read this article ? i think you should , it 's quite EMOPOSITIVE if i do say so myself . it is about a representative named darrell issac , he is a republican and has a southern california seat . how great would it be , to see this massively bad man lose ? hopefully , issac may well quote mercuric on november 8ht : “ ... ask for me to - EMOANTICIPATION and you shall find me a EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS man . ”
i EMOSURPRISE people do n't realize how much of an impact they can have . the article says if people would have done something they could have stopped the extinction of the animals . but at the same EMOANTICIPATION , it is people 's EMOPOSITIVE indirectly that caused the extinction , through contributing to climate EMOFEAR . there is so much that can go out of EMOPOSITIVE in nature when people are involved . when one species dies off , then everything in that ecosystem changes . i EMOSURPRISE the article was EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST of EMOPOSITIVE . but what is the EMOPOSITIVE the EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS they are talking about ? how should people intervene to EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST those animals ?
there are a lot of EMOSADNESS people in russia who survived the second world EMOFEARNEGATIVE who are now trying their best to EMOPOSITIVE . many estimates say that there are a lot of people in russia who survived only on $ 4.50 a day . with this little money they do not have the EMOJOYPOSITIVE of going out to EMOPOSITIVE . also when living on so little money it is EMOFEARNEGATIVE because of health care problems . if one has to have EMOFEARSADNESS or even get expensive medication it can be a EMOPOSITIVETRUST EMONEGATIVESADNESS to their life style . i hope the russian EMOTRUST becomes better enough to support it 's elderly and everyone else in the country .
there 's something terrifying about being attacked by animals . it 's even more EMODISGUSTFEARNEGATIVESADNESS to find out the animals that are attacking you are the ones you think are so EMOPOSITIVE and EMOJOYPOSITIVE . i just read an article about squirrels attacking a retirement home and injuring three elderly . it must have been so terrifying for them to encounter this event . imagine going out to feed the squirrels like you usually do and in turn get attacked by these rabid critters ! it 's so shocking and i 'm still EMOFEARNEGATIVE after EMOPOSITIVE this . they had to call in the ambulances and animal control to help the situation out . this is EMONEGATIVE . the bites from the EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVE could EMOPOSITIVE to EMONEGATIVE and other diseases . i feel troubled thinking about this because these elderly ca n't really EMOANGERFEAR quick enough in these situations .
i just read about a car EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESSSURPRISE in EMOPOSITIVE georges EMOTRUST , near clinton . it involved three vehicles and it happened at the tail end of rush hour . it said that one woman was critically EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS , but i wonder if the passengers in the other two vehicles were EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS . maryland drivers EMONEGATIVE . i EMOFEARNEGATIVE anywhere near dc since the roads are not EMOPOSITIVE to EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST driving .
i just read this EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS article about wells fargo that i EMOANTICIPATION i would EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST with you . it turns out that low EMOPOSITIVETRUST employees were signing people up for products and things that they did not need . sometimes they were even forging signatures to get this done . now before you EMOJOYPOSITIVE to conclusions and thin k that this is all the employees EMONEGATIVESADNESS let me EMOTRUST you in some more . EMOPOSITIVETRUST came up with a quota and incentive EMOTRUST where employees(who do n't make very good money to begin with ) would make EMOPOSITIVE money the more people they signed up to these new EMOTRUST . so basically the people in charge over there EMOANTICIPATION that it was a good idea to screw over their EMOTRUST holders and give their low - EMOPOSITIVETRUST employees EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS quotas , all so they could make more money . then its the workers getting fired .
EMOFEARNEGATIVE this news makes me so EMODISGUSTNEGATIVESADNESS . the worst thing a person can do is to EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS a EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS animal for no EMOPOSITIVE . it 's so sickening that someone felt the need to senselessly murder one of these amazing horses . it makes me so sad that this happened , and i really hope the EMONEGATIVE gets brought to EMOPOSITIVETRUST .
the tweets attacked her personally , she explained in a blog post on thursday , and EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVE the end of “ mockingbird . ” “ mockingbird is canceled , ” cain had tweeted early last week . “ but we need to make sure @marvel makes room for more titles by women about women EMOANGER EMONEGATIVE . ” she also tweeted out the EMOTRUST of the last “ mockingbird ” issue and encouraged followers to buy that issue and “ send a message to @marvel that there ’s room in comics for super her stories about grown - up women .
EMODISGUSTNEGATIVE i ca n't ever imagine being in a EMOFEAR like these people . first your scared about just trying to get out . then your looking out for your neighbors and their pets . man just EMONEGATIVE really EMONEGATIVESADNESS . now they have to find somewhere to stay . just turns your life upside down . paperwork keepsakes so hard to get over . even if your not EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS it must affect you for the EMOPOSITIVE of your life .
apparently an actor was EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST dead in a EMOPOSITIVE EMOTRUST host 's home . not sure what occurred but you have to feel sorry for those close to them . i certainly do n't want to be EMONEGATIVESADNESS and assume that demons finally caught up with him or an EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVE of some sort occurred but it is odd and they clearly have family who EMONEGATIVESADNESS a loved one . it a EMODISGUSTFEARNEGATIVESADNESS that someone with EMOPOSITIVE to EMOJOYPOSITIVE and act would lose their life at a EMOPOSITIVE age and i EMOSURPRISE it could be any of us but it 's sad fur those who knew him and my heart goes out to them .
if people are EMOFEARSADNESS about others to where they feel EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVE . they need to EMONEGATIVESADNESSSURPRISE the situation entirely . no EMOPOSITIVE things out , no seeing what happens . if you feel threatened , EMONEGATIVESADNESSSURPRISE ! the EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS is most people think they ca n't just drop everything . but it 's mostly because they either do n't know how , or do n't want to live any other EMODISGUSTNEGATIVE lifestyle than they are accustomed to . kids run away all the EMOANTICIPATION from home with no skills , or means to get by . many of them end up making it out ok . some do n't , but it 's usually due to making the EMONEGATIVE choices . taking the easy way out . we are free to make our own choices , and live the life we can live . so why would any one ever put up with feeling threatened , when they can just EMONEGATIVESADNESSSURPRISE , and EMOFEAR . even if you have no where to go , you can always EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS .
just EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST this article ; not EMOSURPRISE by this at all . i ca n't believe there are truly EMOPOSITIVE EMOSURPRISE voters but i 'm not EMOSURPRISE ; racism is something they all bind together with . she really should just EMONEGATIVESADNESSSURPRISE the party if she actually has any EMOPOSITIVE . feel free to EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST this with someone else as well if you want .
hey check this out , you are a big leonard cohen fan right ? this is sad , but this is life . i often think about the deaths of old people , should we be sad ? should we celebrate their life ? what is the appropriate emotion to experience at this point . i know i was sad when my two grand fathers died , but that is EMOTRUST .
apparently isis is still EMOTRUST in pakistan .. there have been numerous attacks on the EMOANTICIPATIONPOSITIVE and a EMOFEARPOSITIVETRUST EMOPOSITIVE . as bad as this group is for some EMOPOSITIVE i do n't find them to be that big of a EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVE to americans . at least not the ones here at home . by the way was n't donald EMOSURPRISE suppose to get rid of isis EMOPOSITIVE ?
hello friends i have just read an article about these people from egypt that were on a boat and then they got shipwrecked i think . the recent EMOANTICIPATIONPOSITIVETRUST of the earth have no EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST the evidence about the EMOANTICIPATION and the bodies and are beginning to make ideas up about the people . they said that the people were on the EMOANTICIPATION and i forgot why or what they were doing but it is still a little bit EMOPOSITIVE . the article was very EMOANTICIPATION and hard to read though .
hey , are n't you from the south ? have you had any issues with wildfires in your area ? there 's all this EMOPOSITIVE about forest fires and droughts in california , but this is the first EMOANTICIPATION i 've heard about stuff going down in your area . everything okay down there ? make sure you stay EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST ! i know you do n't go out much , but it does n't take much to have a disaster to EMONEGATIVESADNESS on your doorstep .
it does n't matter what country you live in . the powerful will always stomp on the weak . EMOANTICIPATION anything from your EMOFEARNEGATIVE or your party is EMONEGATIVESADNESS unless you have some amount of EMONEGATIVEPOSITIVE . EMOANGER have not stopped EMOFEARNEGATIVE , poverty , disease , EMOANGERNEGATIVE , or anything else . it simply is a way to subjugate mass amounts of people no EMOSURPRISE than in olden times . they keep painting a EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST picture , and we all live in this EMONEGATIVESURPRISE that life can be great here or there . but that is because there is not enough EMOPOSITIVE on the EMOANGERDISGUSTFEARNEGATIVE things happening under our noses , even in our own neighborhoods . people are EMODISGUSTNEGATIVESADNESS , and those who rise to power will EMOANTICIPATIONPOSITIVETRUST to be the most retched as they sell themselves out to any donor , or support that will keep them in power .
i would feel absolutely EMOANGERDISGUSTFEARNEGATIVE to be in any of these parents shoes , i feel like they probably think they are EMOPOSITIVE EMONEGATIVESADNESS , EMOANTICIPATIONFEARNEGATIVE , deserted . i would be a complete EMODISGUSTNEGATIVE . i font know exactly what i would do in that situation . i feel like the chances are good enough for them to try for that second EMOJOYPOSITIVE but i do understand them not EMONEGATIVESADNESS to try because of the EMONEGATIVE chances of the other one having the erika EMONEGATIVE anyways .
the person that rented out the apartment i feel was in the EMONEGATIVE doing because they dint own the place so when the EMONEGATIVESADNESS came it he wast able to fix the problems making it the owners EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS which led to them finding out and having to file the EMOTRUST suite for 20k to get there money back so it was a EMODISGUSTNEGATIVE situation
yuck . although i do n't think you can say it was particularly disturbing for women because a lot of women voted for the misogynistic EMONEGATIVE . the EMOPOSITIVETRUST EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS was reasonable people did n't EMONEGATIVE to vote . i did . and after the election news i was so EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS , i stayed home and drank wine that day . i did n't have to work .
i just read this article about a really bad EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESSSURPRISE that happened at a water park . apparently , the ride malfunctioned and threw some kids from the ride and the parents were stuck in the raft and they were stuck underwater and were hitting the machinery below . everyone kept talking about how horrific it was and what a terrible EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS it was . i feel really bad for these people and it really makes you wonder if you should go to a park ever again . you 're suppose to have EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVE at these places but you never really ever think about actually getting EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS when you get on these rides . those poor people , they just wanted to have a nice afternoon and it just ended so EMONEGATIVESADNESS .
hey , josh have you seen this ? world currencies are going to be taking a EMOANGERNEGATIVE , i just wanted to let you know . the complete EMOANGERNEGATIVESADNESS of how to run something as simple as a EMOTRUST multiplied by thousands around the country of india is bringing that country to its knees . we see this EMOANTICIPATION all the EMOANTICIPATION where markets are controlled by the EMOFEARNEGATIVE and something stagnates then we add more controls and now we have a EMONEGATIVESADNESS .
so three missiles get shot up in the air EMOSURPRISE like if this were to be a EMOANTICIPATION EMOPOSITIVETRUST . nobody was going to do anything about it . the craziest part about it is EMOPOSITIVE about the EMOTRUST who the article states that jokingly told his family to EMOPOSITIVE him if he did not return home that night . that man did not return home that i find EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVE .
wow , just wow . i think that the EMOANTICIPATION of nominating this judge for the EMOPOSITIVE EMOANGERANTICIPATIONFEAR really needs to be reexamined closely in that this EMOPOSITIVE could cause bigger problems and EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS across the country . there would be heavy debates and fights from both sides and in the end , there unfortunately would be no EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVE .
while i obviously think that it is sad that an animal is dead since i EMOJOYPOSITIVE animals , what i mostly feel EMOPOSITIVE this story is EMOANGERDISGUSTNEGATIVE . it really annoys and worries me that people insist climate EMOFEAR is a political issue when we can see its effects everywhere , EMOPOSITIVE in the form of the current extinction EMONEGATIVE . i know that this particular one was due to a EMODISGUSTNEGATIVE , but it is part of a EMOPOSITIVE and might be EMOTRUST , so that is what this makes me think of . i always feel EMOANGERNEGATIVE and EMONEGATIVESADNESS about the future whenever i am reminded that extinctions like this and other problems are just going to keep happening because conservatives EMONEGATIVE to acknowledge that the EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS even exists . it could be EMOTRUST , but probably wo n't be , and that irritates me .
i really think everyone should read this article . this story shows perfectly how damaging and EMOFEARNEGATIVE guns can be to all people on both sides of the EMOTRUST . this is why this country needs to make it harder for everyone to be able to obtain a EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVE . this is especially EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST to those who have been involved in domestic and sexual abuse incidents .
overall the EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS here seems to be that overuse of EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST in a certain area needs to be stopped . simply pumping more water is n't the issue and perhaps the EMOTRUST that too many people are trying to use that water source should be something that 's looked into . there should also be some sort of testing and filtering EMOTRUST put into place to EMOPOSITIVE the people .
remember that story that i told you about my EMOANTICIPATIONPOSITIVETRUST paul from my old EMOANTICIPATION and how he had served in iraq and had come home and had potsdam ? i EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST this article that explains it EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST good and think you might be interested in EMOPOSITIVE it to deal with the new coworker that you have that has similar issues .
it is about EMOANTICIPATION that for profit education has had the breaks put on them . EMOPOSITIVETRUST a substandard education at the students and EMOFEARNEGATIVE 's expense in EMODISGUSTNEGATIVE . they should have been shut down years earlier . there are so many cheaper and better alternatives to obtaining and education . i do n't feel sorry for them
i feel bad for that EMOJOYPOSITIVE . the way it sounds , especially with the bottle of milk being in there , it sounds like someone had the EMOJOYPOSITIVE and could n't keep it so they left it there . i wish people would use the EMOFEAR station EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST EMOPOSITIVETRUST EMOPOSITIVE . i EMOANTICIPATION it was EMOPOSITIVE that they mentioned that a 14 year old heard the cries . i wonder if the 14 year old was the one who had the EMOJOYPOSITIVE and had to EMOFEAR it .
a guy named collins was charged with EMODISGUSTFEARNEGATIVE nude celebrity photos and videos . while his behavior is clearly EMONEGATIVESADNESS , one thing to note is the article is calling this a hack . hacking and nothing is EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST , not you , not yours , not your loved ones , is EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST of a way to make people EMOFEARNEGATIVE and keep EMOPOSITIVE . in reality , this guy just kinda sent an email to these celebrities and said hey i need your password this is google from google , EMOANTICIPATION its an EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESSSURPRISE and they EMONEGATIVESADNESS for it . i feel bad for them , we 've all been tricked at least once in our lives by something on the internet , but it is n't like this guy EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVE the security of google and we 're all EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS .
this is the EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST of stuff that happens all over and is always under reported because the perpetrators of such sexual harassment and assaults are EMOTRUST by their power in society and other powerful people . it was EMOANTICIPATION just an unspoken or open EMOTRUST that everyone basically knew , but it 's good that it 's finally EMOANTICIPATION to light with people willing to speak up , especially the victims . if they did n't speak up , people would go on thinking that this EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST of stuff only happens in tv and movies . art imitates life , and EMONEGATIVE avers .
so the EMOFEARPOSITIVETRUST EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST this woman wondering the streets in philadelphia at 1 am with no coat on in the EMONEGATIVE . she was in some EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST of daze , probably alzheimer 's or something . anyways , their trying to identify her . it would EMONEGATIVE to be in that state of mind . sounds EMOANGERDISGUSTFEARNEGATIVE and potentially scary if your cognizant enough .
well toughie the frog died . he was in a zoo . he was twelve years old at least . they say he was EMOSADNESS since he was caught as an adult . i wonder what gave him such a EMOANTICIPATION life . they do n't live EMOANTICIPATION around here where i live . i can not imagine a frog living that EMOANTICIPATION . that 's as EMOANTICIPATION as a dog almost . i hope they earned a great deal from him .
i saw some heartbreaking news and i could not believe it . why would EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS and EMOPOSITIVETRUST people be killed over something that they did not do or had no EMOANGER with ? i will never understand why some things in this world are the way that they are . there needs to be EMOFEAR but EMONEGATIVESADNESS i do not think we will see it soon .
it 's really EMONEGATIVESADNESS that north korea does n't seem able to help their citizens during a natural disaster . hopefully some other country is willing to step up and EMOPOSITIVE EMOPOSITIVE , although i do n't know how that works since they do n't really let people in . it must be EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST devastating if they are resorting to asking for outside help .
" i had heard about the huge fires burning in the indonesia area and the EMOFEARNEGATIVE clouds they are EMOPOSITIVE but i did n't realize it was so bad . apparently there is a EMOTRUST EMOPOSITIVE that says 100,000 people have been killed by this . the researchers tried to EMOPOSITIVETRUST " " early deaths " " and got that figure . i EMOFEARNEGATIVE the root EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS is EMODISGUSTNEGATIVE . some of the business owners in indonesia and malaysia are extremely rich and can act with impunity , even though their actions cause great EMOFEARNEGATIVE to the environment and to humans near and far . maybe they should be charged with crimes for the deaths . on the other hand i EMOANGERDISGUSTNEGATIVE the idea of people being convicted of crimes via EMOTRUST analysis . it is too easy to EMONEGATIVE . "
i think almost everyone has an opinion on hilary clinton over donald EMOSURPRISE . many did n't EMOANTICIPATIONPOSITIVESURPRISETRUST donald to win the election but here we are . so many political scandals unfolded and more continuing to unravel . many did n't EMOPOSITIVE with hilary from the benghazi EMOANTICIPATION and many did n't EMOPOSITIVE with EMOSURPRISE , but in the end that 's just EMOANGER .
it 's not pleasant to think of these animals being mistreated , but for all the problems in the world something like this seems rather minor . of course it would be great to ensure good keeping of animals , but there are more pressing tragedies happening much more often to human beings that we should EMOPOSITIVE on before addressing these issues of EMOSURPRISE animal mus - handling .
the EMOPOSITIVE why they 're EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS people over there is because the EMOPOSITIVETRUST forces are occupying their country . if only we would keep our EMODISGUST out of others ' business , then maybe , just maybe the world would become a better place . but as with all empires ( and america is no different ) , they eventually EMONEGATIVESADNESS because of internal forces .
that would be a scary situation to live in . it is sad that the people feel like the EMOFEARNEGATIVE cares more about the elephants and animals than the people . these people must EMOPOSITIVE how to live with the elephants , but it seems like it is a scary thing to do . i would hate to try and live in that situation with children . i also think that anyone who is going to EMOPOSITIVE there should be made aware of the dangers of the elephants so that they do n't get EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS or killed like the 29 year old woman did in the article .
hey ! so i just read this article about the internet in schools . i EMOSURPRISE that several years ago , the EMOFEARNEGATIVE came up with this program to get internet and EMOPOSITIVE in to schools and make it possible for as many or all students to have access to computers and the internet . however , according to this article , this program is not EMOPOSITIVE the way that it was set up to work and students are not actually benefiting from this program that costs a lot of money ! i was EMOANGERNEGATIVESADNESS to read this , as i feel that the internet can be such a EMOPOSITIVE tool in education , but then i really was n't EMOSURPRISE at all to EMOPOSITIVE that the EMOFEARNEGATIVE is n't doing what it has been set up to do or what it is EMOPOSITIVE us citizens it will do . does n't the EMOFEARNEGATIVE just infuriate you and make you think you could do better ?
i 'm EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVE germany is trying to help a lot of refugees when other countries ( ahem the us ) are trying to get out of helping people . however if they 're going to have that reputation they need to be EMOANTICIPATIONPOSITIVETRUST to deal with the number of individuals who will try to come . it feels like so many of the problems these refugees are running from have been created at some point due to us / european colonization and intervention , so i 'm EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVE they 're at least trying .
cricket players in england are likely going to have trouble sleeping after a 4ht day of the first test . being in their shoes , playing hard and EMOPOSITIVE together is the key to EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS bangladesh and they need to stay on EMOANTICIPATIONPOSITIVETRUST of their game in order to win . while it 's physically EMONEGATIVE , EMOPOSITIVE up or blaming EMONEGATIVE of sleep is simply not an EMOPOSITIVE for the EMOTRUST .
i just read a EMOANGERDISGUSTFEARNEGATIVE article online about 10 people getting EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS after a huge EMOFEAR started in an apartment complex in arizona . that is so EMOANGERDISGUSTFEARNEGATIVE i really feel bad for them . the say that eight of the people had minor injuries so that is good that it was only minor . unfortunately one person had to be taken to the hospital but they are in EMOPOSITIVETRUST condition so that is good news . apparently two people outside of the apartment were also EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS by the EMOFEAR some how . i think they were able to get the EMOFEAR under control EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST easily though cause it only lasted around 10 minutes . they had to have the gas company come and shut off the gas and apparently they are investigating what could have caused the EMOFEAR in the first place . that reminds me of the EMOFEAR that happened at my neighbors house .
i just read an article about a EMOTRUST who killed his EMOJOYPOSITIVE 's adoptive EMOTRUST because he had molested her and got off with a light sentence . its EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS . i mean , i can see why he would snap , if you can call it that , but .. i font know . my feelings are all over the place . if someone EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS my kids i could see imagining EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS thyme , but i EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESSTRUST i could acct on it . and there are all these people EMOJOYPOSITIVE his actions . like he has this EMODISGUSTNEGATIVE fan club for doing it . his life is ruined , his EMOJOYPOSITIVE is a EMODISGUSTNEGATIVE dealing with the EMODISGUSTNEGATIVESADNESS of it all , someone is dead . and it said on the way to EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS the old man , he shot at an old boyfriend of hers he suspected was abusive . i d , maybe the heat of the moment since he already decided he was going to EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS for murder . just such an emotional read
this is absolutely awful . i ca n't even imagine the amount of EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS the EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS had . the only suspected EMOPOSITIVE was after communal EMONEGATIVE the sexual advances of one of the men inside the apartment ? really ? that 's not a good EMOPOSITIVE at all to EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS someone . how EMOANTICIPATIONTRUST he . what a EMONEGATIVE story this is , and it makes me heart churn just trying to think of the robbed life that was taken .
i think parents complaining about their preteen children are overreacting . just deal with it and everything will be okay . you ca n't place them in a toy box anymore or sit them in front of the tv and tell them to sit and EMOANTICIPATIONFEAR it until it 's done . i 'm not EMONEGATIVESADNESS about this because i have no kids of my own and i could care less .
big businesses should really be held EMOPOSITIVETRUST for where the bailouts they receive really go . yet the EMOFEARNEGATIVE do n't really EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVEPOSITIVE any rules . just here is money and EMOTRUST them to use it as it was EMOANTICIPATIONPOSITIVE for them . we really should stop corporate lobbying in congress . look at these people using the bailout money just for EMOJOYPOSITIVE . i am outraged !
i just read a troubling little snippet about a family who EMONEGATIVESADNESS their home in washington d.c. they have n't yet identified the cause of the EMOANGERNEGATIVE , but a family of five ha not only been EMOANGERFEARSADNESS , but they also EMONEGATIVESADNESS two cats which i 'm sure were very EMOPOSITIVE to them . i 'm EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVE to hear that the red EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS has stepped in to lend EMOPOSITIVE to this EMONEGATIVE family .
the EMOFEARPOSITIVETRUST asked for help to the people for identify the lady . i think , she was EMOFEAR from the EMOFEARPOSITIVETRUST EMOTRUST and placed in the philadelphia high way . the EMOFEARPOSITIVETRUST explores the identification marks of the lady . the EMOFEARPOSITIVETRUST asked for help to the people for identify the lady . i think , she was EMOFEAR from the EMOFEARPOSITIVETRUST EMOTRUST and placed in the philadelphia high way . the EMOFEARPOSITIVETRUST explores the identification marks of the lady .
the upsurge in violent deaths is a troubling and terrifying EMOPOSITIVE to face , based on the fbi 's statistics . it 's not a good EMOTRUST of a society 's health to see such EMOFEARNEGATIVE statistics . we need to be doing everything we can to help mitigate this EMONEGATIVE . as for the EMOANGERNEGATIVE of buses inside the lincoln EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS ? that was another terrible EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS which would 've been avoided had the EMOPOSITIVE course of EMOPOSITIVE been taken .
ya know a lot of people hate the jews . yet we both know lots of jews and i like most of them . to me it does n't really matter as i never even EMOANTICIPATION about someone being a jew until i got EMOSADNESS . people are people . jews are smart . jews have always been smart at least for generations . smart people make money and are good at business . just the way it goes . jew , jew jew , i 'm EMODISGUSTNEGATIVESADNESS of all of the jew hate . otoh people have a legitimate concern to EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVE that EMOSURPRISE being elected will cause problems like ww2 did . after all jews tend to be republican and likely donated a ton of money to EMOSURPRISE and they are more powerful today than they ever were . still whatever , it does n't affect us .
" i can EMOSADNESS with what these parents must be feeling . not because i have raised a per - teen , but because i can vividly remember that EMOANTICIPATION in my life . middle EMOTRUST is hard , EMODISGUSTNEGATIVE , and scary . i remember being bullied by girls that i idolized . i was EMOPOSITIVE to have a mother who was very caring and easy to EMOPOSITIVE to . she sympathized with me without making me feel like a EMONEGATIVE EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVE who needed my parents to win my battles for me . she would say " " that 's awful , EMOPOSITIVE . now , what are you going to do about it ? " " "
hey hun ! i was just EMOPOSITIVE this article about a family of 3 EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVESURPRISE EMONEGATIVESADNESS boys who went through foster care and ended up in EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS later on in life , and it made me want to EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST it with you . it breaks my heart EMOPOSITIVE this probably happens all the EMOANTICIPATION in our country ! that there are kids who , through no EMONEGATIVESADNESS of their own , are set on a path that EMOANTICIPATIONPOSITIVE leads to their EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS and EMOANGERDISGUSTFEARNEGATIVE later in life ! there need to be changes made to the foster EMOTRUST so that there are more homes available and counseling for these kids so that they can EMOPOSITIVE at an early age to deal with the things they are going through instead of internalizing it all and becoming EMOANGERDISGUSTNEGATIVE and bitter . what do you think ? maybe we could write some letters to get people thinking about this situation !
it 's sad these days how often EMOFEARPOSITIVETRUST are being attacked for just being EMOFEARPOSITIVETRUST . mental health is such a EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS , we need to find better ways to help people so they do n't get to the point of harming others . whenever i hear about an EMOPOSITIVETRUST being EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS i think of your husband . we are very EMOJOYPOSITIVESURPRISE men like him are choosing to spend their lives to EMOPOSITIVE us . i hope we can get help to more people so i can stop EMOANTICIPATIONFEARNEGATIVESADNESS if there is someone out there waiting for him .
did you hear about the airstrikes in yemeni ? i ca n't believe it . i would have been petrified ! forty three people were killed , but could be up to sixty .. the bodies were just laying everywhere.and they were covering them with blankets . this is just one EMOPOSITIVETRUST of those that died . since the EMOANGERNEGATIVE has been going on they say over 10,000 people have died from this EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS , many just EMOPOSITIVETRUST civilians . i ca n't imagine being in that situation .
hey , josh here is another example of total insanity in a EMOTRUST that has taken millions of jobs from people around the world but refuses to give any serious consideration to the health and welfare of its citizens . these people are pawns and the sad thing is no one there has the will to fix any of the sanitation problems or air quality issues . what is so hard about it ? maybe they should EMOANTICIPATION eating some of their relatives , you know , cattle .
how EMOANGERDISGUSTFEARNEGATIVE ! i do n't care what EMOANGERNEGATIVE anyone has EMOPOSITIVETRUST , EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS a person and then setting them on EMOFEAR is detestable ! i hope and pray that the authorities will be able to find out where this video originated from and bring the perpetrators to EMOPOSITIVETRUST ! it makes me EMODISGUSTNEGATIVESADNESS that a human being could do that to another human !
" now this is a EMOPOSITIVE issue : " " why do EMODISGUSTNEGATIVE patients get EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS care ? many doctors do n’t see past the EMODISGUSTNEGATIVESADNESS — you must lose weight , a EMOPOSITIVETRUST told sarah bramble , advising a 1,200 - calorie - a - day diet . but ms. bramble had a basic EMOPOSITIVE : how much do i EMOANTICIPATIONTRUST ? the EMOPOSITIVETRUST ’s scale went up to 350 pounds , and she was heavier than that . if she did not know the number , how would she know if the diet was EMOPOSITIVE ? " " a populace that is so EMONEGATIVESADNESS on health and nutrition that they do n't know that it 's mathematically EMONEGATIVESADNESS not to lose weight at over 350 pounds on a 1200 calorie a day diet . what 's EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS is a EMOPOSITIVETRUST who is so EMOANGERNEGATIVESADNESS that he ca n't tell her that . if your clothes get bigger you are EMOANGERNEGATIVESADNESS weight .

ca n't believe the EMOTRUST failed to convict the people involved in the national wildlife refuge takeover in oregon . the people were n't even from oregon . they traveled half way across the country , invaded the facility , and barricaded themselves inside . yet the EMOTRUST did n't find reasonable cause to believe they impeded wildlife service workers from doing their jobs . bunch of alt - right would - be cowboys .
i EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST this article and wanted to EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST it with you . very disturbing and odd results from the 2016 presidential campaign demographics results . very EMOSURPRISE to see so many latinos voting for a dude who is so blandly racist . i think all the EMONEGATIVESADNESS people who voted for EMOSURPRISE are going to see that they were EMOSADNESS to the family barbecue next year as well x
what a disaster ... i ca n't believe their course of EMOPOSITIVE is to do nothing too . i ca n't even imagine how this is going to affect the local wildlife . they should be funding environmental groups to help the local animals in any way possible . this is going to have far reaching consequences too , as the poisoned fish and birds will affect other species and they 'll end up effecting us as well . i wish there was some way to EMOFEARNEGATIVE these terrible accidents .
after EMOPOSITIVE this article on some of the federal prisons , i am extremely EMOANGERNEGATIVESADNESS about the treatment of prisoners in these facilities . the way that the guards are treating the prisoners are literally inhumane . i understand that the prisoners are convicts and felons and really deserve to be place in EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS as their EMOANGERDISGUSTFEARNEGATIVE , but there needs to be EMOPOSITIVETRUST for the actions of the guards mistreating them and basically treating them like animals . prisons are about EMOANTICIPATIONPOSITIVE or at least they should be , but in this article with the countless reports from prisoners about very EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVE and disturbing situations i ca n't fathom to understand what goes on in the minds of these guards running the prisons . we seriously need to do something about these conditions .
according to dr. jack dresser , a EMOTRUST EMOTRUST and EMONEGATIVE of conversion therapy practices , there is not just one set of practices understood to be used in conversion therapy . “ people have tried all kinds of things because none them really work , ” he told the huffing ton post . dresser also said that the EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST of research surrounding conversion therapy has taken place on adults who’be undergone the process , and there is very little research surrounding lente youth who have been through conversation therapy practices . “ but of course you have anecdotal stories , ” he said . “ some children have reported running away from home , there have been cases in the news of EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVESURPRISE people of when their family EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST out about them or they came out and the family insisted they go to conversion therapy

" so remember the flint mi water EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS from years back ? the one where the idiots decided to use their own water EMOPOSITIVE from a dam which leaked led . well apparently now the EMOFEARNEGATIVE is flipping out that its a nationwide EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS . or should i say the " " scientists " " are flipping out since we have never heard of EMOPOSITIVE in the water anywhere outside of the flint mi disaster "
wow , i just read an article describing the problems venezuela is having with its new EMOPOSITIVETRUST . about 80 % of the people are dissatisfied with his leadership and want him out . but there is n't a smooth process put into place for that . even the vatican is trying to EMOPOSITIVETRUST , but to no avail so far . i ca n't help but think of all the problems the us has lately , but we do have a constitution and a EMOTRUST for EMOFEAR . i am not sure how venezuela will fix things peacefully , and how its citizens will fare through all this . the article made comparisons with cuba , and previous leadership , but i did not fine a clear EMOPOSITIVE .
i think with all the social media and news stories , recent incidents involving EMOFEARNEGATIVE attacks , and those who are of a different race commuting these acts , especially since the 9/11 EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVE this will always be an issue with people because we are just alarmed , even though some may have nothing to do with terrorism or any type of situation regarding that but they will always be perceived that way because of what happened in the past . it 's probably not right of those who are EMODISGUSTNEGATIVE and the airlines really need to do something about all the complaints .
what an awful EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS no family should be EMONEGATIVESADNESS to this . this is really getting out of hand i ca nt believe the middle east still has so much EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS . its really EMOANGERDISGUSTNEGATIVE . i hope our boys can help EMOPOSITIVE the situation and keep things safer than they are now . its just EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVE how much a person must be EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVE to go through with these actions
while EMOPOSITIVE this article all i could think of is how much of a EMODISGUSTFEARNEGATIVESADNESS and EMOFEARNEGATIVESURPRISE it is of the recent shootings that have been taking place all over the usa . i know we have talked about guns and EMOPOSITIVE in the past , but i 'm starting to think it is EMOPOSITIVETRUST to look at what we can do to stop these acts and how we can make a EMOFEAR ourselves . i also was EMOSURPRISE that they did not try to take the story and flip it into being some type of political EMOPOSITIVE about how the EMOFEAR was made about EMOANGER or a race EMOFEARNEGATIVE .
i just do n't understand russia . i mean they seem to be a country that is EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST , right ? how is it that they so openly support terrorism ? i just do n't understand how they stand with syria and are ok with all of the EMOANGERDISGUSTFEARNEGATIVE things that are happening there . i think if russia actually stood up for what is right , the world would be a much better place .
hey you hear about the coffee killer ? in indonesia some chick who is also australian has been EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST EMOANGERNEGATIVESADNESS of EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS her EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST by putting EMOFEARNEGATIVE in her coffee . i did not get too many details about all of the evidence that they have against her but to me at least it does not seem like they have that much evidence . i EMOSURPRISE she ordered her EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST a coffee before her EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST got there and right after she took a sip of the coffee she keeled over and died . EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS , right ? i think she probably did it but their EMOPOSITIVE is weak and i do not think that she would have been EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST EMOANGERNEGATIVESADNESS if the trial was going on in the us .
that is nice . isis is using chemical weapons against us now ? what is the world EMOANTICIPATION to , and how much longer are we going to put our EMOFEAR out there for this ? especially now that they are being EMONEGATIVE to chemicals that can burn the skin , and due some bad EMOANGERDISGUSTNEGATIVESADNESS . this does n't does n't seem right at all .
banking a banking company in spain had their EMOANTICIPATION members spend EMONEGATIVE private money from the EMOTRUST on hotels , entertainment EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST , and other luxuries . all this was EMONEGATIVE from EMOPOSITIVETRUST cards used by the EMOTRUST itself . the spending was EMONEGATIVE and not reported to the EMONEGATIVESADNESS authorities at all . banking was already in the limelight already due to being bailed out by the EMOFEARNEGATIVE in 13 million dollars .
the native american have been through so much already to try to keep just a EMONEGATIVE part of the EMOPOSITIVE that they called their own and slow but surely they EMOANTICIPATIONPOSITIVETRUST to lose a EMOANGERNEGATIVE against the usa EMOFEARNEGATIVE . it seems as though it is just a very period of EMOANTICIPATION before the only place to find native americans with be in the EMOANGERDISGUSTNEGATIVE pages of our EMOTRUST books .
this is sad that a company that is based here in the us and that actually manufacturers its products in the us is in EMONEGATIVESADNESS . more EMOPOSITIVE should have been placed to ensure company 's EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVE . more companies should be encouraged to manufacture their products in our country while also making them affordable and appealing .
poor man , he had lot of EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVE to get and more EMOPOSITIVE plans in his life and could n't EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST them because of his EMOSURPRISE death , at least his dead was natural , i EMOSURPRISE , because that is n't specified in the article . my deepest condolences to his friends and family members , he will be missed in the comedians EMOPOSITIVE .
it 's good that they did n't have to EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS the emu . every EMOANTICIPATION i hear about one of these animal escapes i get the feeling that someone is going to end up EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS the animal ; i EMOANTICIPATIONPOSITIVESURPRISETRUST either an EMOPOSITIVETRUST with EMOPOSITIVETRUST EMOPOSITIVETRUST or some EMONEGATIVE EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVE with a EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVE who wants to EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS something EMOPOSITIVE is going to end up EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVE it . i EMOANTICIPATION i saw a EMONEGATIVESURPRISE bird like run across the road one morning when i was driving to work . it was n't big enough to be an emu but it was similar . i was EMONEGATIVESADNESS that someone was going to EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS it , whatever it was .
i can not stand donald EMOSURPRISE and his EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVE mongering . most muslim people i know are very , very EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST people . it is so EMONEGATIVESADNESS there are so many hate crimes because of the EMONEGATIVE our EMOPOSITIVETRUST continues to EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESURPRISE on twitter . it 's not just muslims . it 's everyone that is not part of the alt - EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST movement . jewish people , lente people . EMONEGATIVESADNESS people . it is fueled by hate and EMONEGATIVE . trumps muslim EMONEGATIVE did more EMOFEARNEGATIVE than good ! he just caused EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVE , creating a deeper divide in our country . it 's sad .
looks like india and pakistani relations are going straight to hell . it is unclear if it was really sanctioned by their EMOFEARNEGATIVE , but pakistan shelled across the border and killed 13 indian civilians . pakistan is saying india shelled them back and killed 6 of theirs . they are having some sort of EMOANGERNEGATIVE over their border and neither side really wishes to back down . india claims they were EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS a terrorist encampment on the pakistan side of the border , and pakistan claims they EMODISGUSTNEGATIVE one of their EMOFEAR bases . the whole thing is a big EMODISGUSTNEGATIVE and ca n't help the stability of the region .
did you read this story about the EMOANTICIPATION climber who died trying to climb a EMOANTICIPATION in vietnam ? it was very sad . the girlfriend begged him to get help but he EMONEGATIVESADNESS until it was too EMONEGATIVESADNESS . i feel so bad for his family and girlfriend he left behind . i do take EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST in EMOPOSITIVE that 's what he wanted to do and he died following what he wants .
i ca n't say that i specifically care about the election , and would rather have someone besides the two EMOPOSITIVE parties win for once . i also personally font like EMOSURPRISE , as i find him to be a rather bombastic EMODISGUSTNEGATIVE , and wish hillary would have won , though i did n't particularly want either of them . i hope he takes the EMONEGATIVE of the election into becoming a better EMOPOSITIVETRUST .
" look at this article . notice anything EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS ? yeah , any sources or any EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST of backing for these claims or any sources for the supposed " " EMOPOSITIVETRUST estate developers " " EMOPOSITIVE false data . so , EMOANTICIPATIONFEAR how well my feelings beat up this straw man i 've set up ! you 'd think they 'd have noticed how EMOANTICIPATION EMOFEAR little has been going on about this and yet still no fallen EMOPOSITIVE . "
hello , i feel very bad about y 's death , she was so EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVESURPRISE and already a very EMOJOYPOSITIVE person . i do believe she was very aware that her EMOFEARPOSITIVE EMOANTICIPATIONPOSITIVE had inherent risks that could EMOANTICIPATIONPOSITIVE cause her death . it angers and saddens me that people would undermine her role a EMOPOSITIVE fighter EMOPOSITIVETRUST by making rude remarks stating there are other more EMOJOYPOSITIVE women fliers .
i think in this day and age , there is no EMOPOSITIVE to be poaching tigers , or any other rare game for that matter . i 've discussed this with my friends before , the poachers are generally low EMOPOSITIVE people , trying to feed themselves , and they 're selling to the highest bidder they can find . even if you EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS the poachers , more will EMONEGATIVESURPRISE up out of desperation . one day , we 'll look back and see all of the EMOANGERDISGUSTNEGATIVE EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS rare animals purposefully , rather than the crappy way we move them out of their territories naturally as humans .
wow . that is really sad ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! i wonder why his EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST would EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS him . must not have been friends after all , huh ? ? ? ? ? ? i wonder how EMOANTICIPATION the body had been there before he was EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST . money was probably the EMOPOSITIVE since it usually is . he probably got over on him somehow and dude got his revenge . oh well .......
hello alexander , oh how i need to tell you this story i read , its EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS you know . anyway so i read this story about myanmar ; they are having a huge EMOANTICIPATION about EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVE slavery , its very sad we live in a world that is filled with monsters like this . the EMOPOSITIVE news about this is that the EMOFEARPOSITIVETRUST arrested two family members . i feel good about that EMOANTICIPATION out . i hope they find more and put them into EMOPOSITIVETRUST .

" i 'm saddened to hear the news about his passing . in my experience i believe that comedians get into the field due to an aspect of the desire to help people and give them a few laughs . do n't think i recall his comedy acts but EMOPOSITIVE through the tributes i get the EMOPOSITIVE that people liked him alright and that he was a good guy . his tag line is great - " " that 's not right . " " as if he internalized a EMOPOSITIVE EMOPOSITIVE of right and EMONEGATIVE . so i did n't know his work but i think i like him . "
i really do n't know anything about keisha . the only thing i know is her EMOJOYPOSITIVESADNESS . i do n't know how the EMOJOYPOSITIVESADNESS business works . i do n't know if this is EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST . it seems like if she really wanted to she could have taken more control . it was her EMOPOSITIVE whether or not she ate or not . she let them take control . there is always a EMOPOSITIVE .
i really do n't care about the article i just read . it did n't make me feel any sort of emotions , but i 'm EMOFEARNEGATIVE to EMOTRUST in this box . is EMONEGATIVESADNESS an emotion ? i felt that while EMOPOSITIVE that massive wall of text . stuff like the EMOTRUST and businesses is n't anything EMOPOSITIVE feeling emotion over . it 's also not even really EMOPOSITIVE EMOANTICIPATIONFEARNEGATIVESADNESS about when it 's not something you can actually do anything about yourself .
this article was very EMOPOSITIVE because it talks on how climate EMOFEAR can have influenced the extinction of the melons in there EMOPOSITIVE . it talks a lot about it and basically lets us know that climate EMOFEAR wast the cause of extinction and that us , humans could have prevented this from happening but just decided not to .

it 's EMODISGUSTNEGATIVE how i do n't really feel sorry for these people . timeshares just seem like a terrible idea and i 've always associated it with conspicuous consumption . really ... just rent a hotel room when you can go . buying into a house with other people sounds like a total hassle and a EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS waiting to EMOANTICIPATION . but i ca n't stand how EMODISGUSTNEGATIVE the companies are and how they EMOANGERSURPRISE people around . it just shows that the whole timeshare concept is about digging into people 's pockets . and the only way to get them to stop doing that is to put them out of business if they do n't want to play EMOPOSITIVE .
it is unreal that so many issues can come out of a natural disaster like this . you would think that we could EMOPOSITIVE together more and help people ! i can not imagine what would EMOANTICIPATION to us if a natural sister happened here , we would never recover . this is sew scary . i am EMOJOYPOSITIVE for all of the people volunteering EMOANTICIPATION to help !
wow . here we go again , i EMOSURPRISE ? ? ? ? a couple of years ago that area in tennessee was EMOPOSITIVE devastated by uncontrollable wildfires . many people EMONEGATIVESADNESS their lives and their homes . many businesses were also EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS . i hope this EMOFEAR was n't like that one . a group of kids who were playing with matches in the woods set it on EMOFEAR . they EMOFEAR the area and told no one
no matter what your EMOTRUST , you should be able to EMONEGATIVETRUST your country . her thai EMOTRUST should n't EMOANGER her and should n't have been an issue in this EMOPOSITIVE . tammy duck EMOPOSITIVE and her family should be congratulated on the services they have provided to this country . any type of racism should not be allowed in a EMOPOSITIVE
i 'm EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVE that she let her customers know right away , that was very EMOPOSITIVETRUST of her . there 's so many scammers out there and people who try to rip people off you can never be too EMOPOSITIVE . i 'm always EMOPOSITIVETRUST EMOPOSITIVE when i order anything on the internet checking reviews and everything because i 've been ripped off before . i ordered a handbag and it was n't anything like it was perceived to be online .
when he was born , my son tested for elevated EMOPOSITIVE levels in his blood , and we do n't live near chicago . we were more than a bit scared , and tried to help him EMOPOSITIVE not to stick things in his EMOSURPRISE . EMOPOSITIVE EMOANGERDISGUSTNEGATIVESADNESS is not reversible , and we lived in an old house . to think that every day people are EMONEGATIVE water with as much EMOPOSITIVE as indicated is a bit disturbing - and it 's not going to be EMONEGATIVE to fix .
i just read that poaching of rhinos for ivory has gotten so bad in south africa that they 've EMOANTICIPATION expanding and now have anti - poacher armies . i say good for them . the animals ca n't EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVE back , but hopefully the army can deter poachers . i know the poachers do it because they can make a lot of money , but i just do n't understand it . big game hunters / trophy hunters and poachers are one in the same to me . i think they are both EMOANGERDISGUSTNEGATIVE reasons to EMOFEARNEGATIVE or EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS any animal . the anti - poaching armies have a scary , but , i think , extremely necessary EMOPOSITIVE .
france dismantles ' the EMOFEAR ' in calais — a EMONEGATIVE camp in calais , france , housing nearly 8,000 migrants hoping to EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS into england , is being evacuated and EMONEGATIVE down in what french authorities are calling a “ humanitarian ” EMOFEARTRUST . the migrants , fleeing their homes in africa and the middle east , are being relocated from the camp known as “ the EMOFEAR ” to centers across france . some have decided they do not want to EMONEGATIVESADNESSSURPRISE , and protests have resulted in fires burning through tents , trailers , shacks , and EMONEGATIVE shops in the camp . the dismantlement EMOFEARTRUST is EMOANTICIPATION to last for a week .
" i read an article about how a man killed himself after EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS his wife . it sounded like the man really had some problems . i font understand how you could EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS someone that you say you EMOJOYPOSITIVE . the article said he " " hacked his wife to death " " . that sure sounds rather violent . the woman was rushed to the hospital all bloody and the man was in a EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS . the hospital EMOPOSITIVETRUST that the woman had passed . "
i think they should find out precisely what she did to that EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVE for 3 years and do the same thing to her for 3 years . since she is stronger , she will EMOPOSITIVE , then they can bring her back to complete health , then do it again for the next 3 years , then keep repeating it until she dies . i ca n't EMOPOSITIVE why people like this do these things , but there is a EMOJOYPOSITIVE place in hell . i do n't buy the mental EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS EMODISGUSTNEGATIVE . of course she has a mental EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS , but that should n't automatically imply protection from EMOPOSITIVETRUST . the very nature of murder , especially of this EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST , requires a mental EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS to a certain EMOPOSITIVE , so no pleading insanity . torture her as she tortured that poor EMODISGUSTNEGATIVE .
this is really scary . i do n't think i would want to have my life in the hands of someone else like on this whaling boat . someone 's EMONEGATIVE mistakes can really be bad news for everyone trusting that person . i 'm not sure if i 'd be interested in going out on a boat , whaling , or even a cruise EMOANTICIPATION after EMOPOSITIVE this article . just one EMONEGATIVE move from another person can EMOPOSITIVETRUST your EMOANTICIPATIONNEGATIVE . it must have been so terrifying for these people . i definitely believe all the trauma they say they have endured and i would definitely EMOFEARTRUST for them in the suits they brought against the EMONEGATIVE .
i had no idea that the great lakes area had problems with earthquakes . i 'm EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVE that it was n't a bigger on but it is still had how much EMOANGERDISGUSTNEGATIVESADNESS was done . i feel better for those families that EMONEGATIVESADNESS loved ones . you would think in this modern age we would be able to EMOPOSITIVE earthquakes sooner and have enough EMOANTICIPATION to EMOFEARNEGATIVE an area .
of course they do n't see well as they age ! they 're so much like us , even in the EMONEGATIVE details of how they stretch their arms to be able to perform their work . just like my dad when he ca n't find his glasses and tries to read his magazine . i ca n't even EMOPOSITIVE why some people wo n't see how similar animals are to humans - how actually humans are animals . it blows my mind every day .
cohen moved to new york in 1966 at age 31 to EMOSURPRISE into the EMOJOYPOSITIVESADNESS business . before EMOANTICIPATION , critics were comparing him with bob dylan for the EMOJOYPOSITIVE EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVE of his songwriting . although he influenced many musicians and won many honors , EMOPOSITIVE induction into the EMOPOSITIVE & roll hall of EMOPOSITIVE and the order of canada , cohen rarely made the EMONEGATIVESURPRISE EMOJOYPOSITIVESADNESS charts with his sometimes EMOANGERNEGATIVESADNESS folk - EMOPOSITIVE . his most EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVE admirers compared his works to spiritual EMOANTICIPATION . he sang about EMOTRUST , with references to jesus christ and jewish traditions , as well as EMOJOYPOSITIVE and EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST , political EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS , EMONEGATIVESADNESS and what he once called the search for “ a EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST of EMOPOSITIVE in the EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS of EMOPOSITIVE .
she EMONEGATIVESADNESS my EMOPOSITIVESADNESS really quick . seems like she likes EMOPOSITIVE . this does make me look at paris EMOSURPRISE . these all seem like inside jobs . i would be EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST there . but , i still do n't EMOANTICIPATION on visiting . not a fan of people endorsing candidates in countries that they can not vote . seems like an ego thing .
the EMOANTICIPATION of such conditions in the slaughtering of chickens is very disturbing . i am by no means a vegetarian , and EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST eating EMOFEAR a great deal . however , the EMOANTICIPATION of torturing a EMOFEAR for slaughter turns my EMODISGUST . there needs to be an EMOPOSITIVE EMOPOSITIVE to the slaughtering of all animals , not just EMOFEAR . and i believe a universal approach that is easily controlled and monitored would be ideal , but most likely not cost EMOANTICIPATIONPOSITIVETRUST .
i am a firm EMOTRUST of EMOPOSITIVETRUST till EMOTRUST EMOANGERNEGATIVESADNESS . but come on . there are multiple EMOTRUST with several different EMODISGUSTFEARNEGATIVESADNESS . that are EMOANTICIPATION EMOPOSITIVE towards this guy . this man needs taking off of the streets and put in EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS . the things he did to multiple women is EMOANGERDISGUSTFEARNEGATIVE . i feel bad for these women who did not come EMOPOSITIVE in the beginning . whether they were scared for their lives or just EMODISGUSTNEGATIVESADNESS . it seems like lace could get a girl but just took things to far and to the next EMOPOSITIVETRUST . it EMODISGUSTFEARNEGATIVESADNESS that a EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVESURPRISE man does something like this and ruins his entire life . over EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST .
i am EMOANGERNEGATIVESADNESS and EMOANGERNEGATIVESADNESS about the EMOANTICIPATION of the EMOANTICIPATION on the article . it also saddens me to know that the families involved in the EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS of those students are still hoping to see their family member even after years of waiting . this article reminds me that no matter how EMOANTICIPATION the EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS , the family will always EMOANTICIPATIONNEGATIVE for them to EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST those EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS students .
some EMODISGUSTNEGATIVE bag is at it again EMODISGUSTFEARNEGATIVE naked pictures of people simply because they are celebrities and he can make money from doing it . it blows my mind the EMOPOSITIVETRUST of EMOANGERDISGUSTNEGATIVE people will do in order to make a buck . it seems like people treat celebrities as if they are not people at all . people that EMONEGATIVESADNESSSURPRISE EMONEGATIVESADNESS comments on celebrity pages are taking it to a new EMOPOSITIVETRUST . people say the shittiest things to each other when they 're EMOFEAR behind their computer screen . this particular guy took it to the extreme by EMODISGUSTFEARNEGATIVE their private photos .

" i just ca n't imagine that this poor 4 year old was EMONEGATIVE the way she was . but then i wonder if it is truly an act of EMOPOSITIVETRUST to carry out the same EMOANGERDISGUSTFEARNEGATIVE on the perpetrator . it seems so human to want revenge , but it also feel so EMONEGATIVE . in a way it seems to make " " us " " as " " bad " " as him . it just makes me sad . "
i EMOPOSITIVE that this election is stressful . there seems to be a lot of EMOANGER between parties . people are EMONEGATIVESADNESS about what could EMOANTICIPATION if EMOSURPRISE wins . i think all of the racists will come out of the woodwork . people wo n’t be comfortable . as a EMONEGATIVE , i think things will feel different . people earn’t scared to post when behind a wall on social media .
it always upsets me when i read articles about EMOPOSITIVE conflicts involving native american tribes , especially when it involves oil pipelines . i EMOPOSITIVETRUST support expanding domestic oil operations so as to better EMOTRUST energy independence , but care should be taken to EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST the needs of others when developing pipelines . it may be expensive to ensure environmental care is taken and , when necessary , to reroute the pipelines to EMOFEARNEGATIVE encroaching on sacred lands , but that does n't mean it 's not EMOPOSITIVE the expense .
i just read this article indirectly about climate EMOFEAR that i know you 'll find EMOPOSITIVE . it talks about the extinction of three different species . it 's a sad situation , but if you read it , it was almost entirely the EMONEGATIVESADNESS of man , and climate EMOFEAR only played a EMONEGATIVE part . the worst part is that it could have been prevented if somebody had sounded the EMOFEARNEGATIVESURPRISE in EMOANTICIPATION .
my heart hurts for those affected . i will be praying for the soldiers attacked and their families . as we approach memorial day , we need to reflect on what we have learned in past wars and one thing is clear , mustard gas is not a weapon that should be used , i understand that many of the attacks going on right now EMOPOSITIVE guerrilla EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS but we can not EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVE back in the same ways .
i am writing to you in response to an article i just read about nevada and the water EMOPOSITIVE . it is of a EMOPOSITIVETRUST , as the article points out that the news media primarily only follows what happens in california , and not nevada . which is the driest state , and in need of EMOPOSITIVE and EMOPOSITIVE . i 'm impressed with verna brady , 86 - year - old EMOPOSITIVE there . who cites she would rather move EMOPOSITIVE , than behind , that she , although an EMOPOSITIVETRUST with many EMOJOYPOSITIVE memories , would rather EMOPOSITIVE to what 's required for today , than EMOTRUST on what use to be . that 's a large EMOPOSITIVETRUST , because when it comes to tribes in america , a lot do not to be EMOANGERFEARSADNESS , or relocation , creating emotional and psychological problems are the results . however the present state is also causing more abuse factors in the family .
its EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS that really intense and sad situations are happening around the world but here in usa were EMONEGATIVESADNESS more about who made it passed the first round of the voice or what s the latest viral videos . the EMOTRUST the extremists are using EMOPOSITIVETRUST civilians as human shields is so EMOFEARNEGATIVE and shows they have no EMOPOSITIVETRUST what so ever .
i was EMOPOSITIVE about this article and got caught up in it because of the EMOPOSITIVE topic when it had started , it began talking about all of these massive shootings that have been going on around the country . i felt like that was the EMOPOSITIVE idea and discussing the murders in the EMOPOSITIVETRUST states i feel like they could have posted the differences between the states and other countries around the world as well . its free writing but i think it makes americans look bad .
while i think many of us are troubled with the recent relations with russia and EMOFEARNEGATIVE of rigging our us election , in cahoots with pouts EMOSURPRISE and hacking , we need to sort through the details and make sure we are using EMOPOSITIVETRUST when they are available . suspicions are sometimes unfounded , my heart goes out to the agent 's family .
gosh , who would do something as EMOANGERDISGUSTFEARNEGATIVE as EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS an EMOPOSITIVETRUST animal ( and a EMOJOYPOSITIVE at that ) ? however , i am EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVE that the salt river EMONEGATIVESURPRISE EMOTRUST EMOPOSITIVETRUST group and the american EMONEGATIVESURPRISE EMOTRUST preservation campaign set up a reward to EMOSURPRISE whoever did that . i was also EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST to see that it was an immediate response , not a EMONEGATIVE one . it 's sad that people wo n't come EMOPOSITIVE on their own to bring EMOPOSITIVETRUST and that there has to be a EMOANTICIPATIONPOSITIVE incentive .
the EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS of poaching has become such an epidemic guides in south africa who use to take hunters on big game safari 's are now becoming a different EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST of EMOANTICIPATIONFEARNEGATIVESADNESS themselves . they 've taken up arms in the EMOFEARNEGATIVE on poaching due to the EMOTRUST it is an EMOSURPRISE epidemic at this point . animals like the rhino are on the brink of extinction and poachers do n't care .
i EMOSURPRISE the indigenous people get EMOANGERNEGATIVE again . EMOPOSITIVE and EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVE is always messing with them . i 'm kinda EMONEGATIVESADNESS about the fishing i do . i fish a good bit and EMOPOSITIVE what i EMOSURPRISE . i hope there is n't any methyl mercury in the fish i EMOPOSITIVE . if there is , i wonder if it has messed me up some . that could be where some of my health problems come from . maybe it 's EMOANTICIPATION to stop eating the fish i EMOSURPRISE .
just read an article about the situation in haiti a month after the EMOFEARNEGATIVE . EMOPOSITIVE is being distributed better than after the last EMOFEARNEGATIVE since the capital city was less affected and EMOPOSITIVE from the previous situation were used to make some improvements . but getting EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST and water EMOPOSITIVETRUST tablets distributed , and EMOPOSITIVETRUST , is a big EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS . people are EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVE with hunger and become violent , or give in to despair . EMODISGUSTFEARNEGATIVESADNESS is revving up . these are the immediate problems , but EMOPOSITIVETRUST , EMOANTICIPATION - term rebuilding , voting in the upcoming election , and other issues EMONEGATIVE too . somehow we have to figure out better EMOPOSITIVE efforts for natural disasters .
aw , look , i did n't know pete burns died . i 'm EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVE he was EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST with all his surgeries and his life , even if i was n't . he was so EMOANGER before he did all that , man . EMOJOYPOSITIVE voice . why are all the EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST ones so often the EMONEGATIVE EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST of EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS ? now i have to go listen to that song , or it 's going to be stuck in my head all day .
hey i just wanted to let you know that this is a rough article . the guy took him out and then took his own life . its EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST sad . the guy knew the employees schedule too so he just could have done it whenever . why would he do it and take his own life though i font understand . anyways wanted to let you know i did read it and its EMONEGATIVE . i feel bad for the family that it happened to them . hopefully this does n't EMOANTICIPATION much more
well that sucks for this people in the south . it seems like there 's always something that 's messing with the gas prices . hopefully they 'll get it repaired soon though and things will go back to normal . at least there was n't severe environmental EMOANGERDISGUSTNEGATIVESADNESS , that 's a good thing . if i were down there , i would probably just ride a bike for a few weeks .
i am shocked and saddened by this . what a sad and terrible EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS . i feel so sorry for all the victims and those affected by this event . i ca n't even imagine how devastating this must be for them . what an incredible catastrophe . my thoughts and prayers and best wishes go out for all the many people affected by this EMONEGATIVE catastrophe . i hope that everyone stays EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST for the foreseeable future . i am still in EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESURPRISE .
hats really heartbreaking to read the story about the man who EMONEGATIVESADNESS his family in a car EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESSSURPRISE . i think people who street race are acting very dangerously for now EMOPOSITIVE and it is usually very EMONEGATIVE EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVESURPRISE males who do this . i font know what EMOPOSITIVE to make out of this since the woman and her children did not seem to do anything to deserve this . maybe it takes stories like this to make us realize how p[precious life is and how EMOPOSITIVE we must be
did you hear about this EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVE ? it appears to be random and utterly senseless . an elderly man was killed and the EMOFEARNEGATIVE is now barricaded in his house . there was a lot of misinformation early on about it being EMOTRUST to the election and that the EMOFEARNEGATIVE was a woman . it 's being reported now that both those claims are false . i really feel for that man and his family .
did you see this sad story ? this holocaust survivor has died . she lived a EMOPOSITIVE life recreating a town and now she is dead . do you ever think of how sad life can be . this person survived the awful genocidal regime of hitler . why do human beings EMOANTICIPATION to EMOPOSITIVE so much EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS to one another . it is a sad and EMOANGERDISGUSTFEARNEGATIVE way of being .
i do n't know if you 've seen this article about the EMOFEARNEGATIVE on cops , but i EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST it EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST unconvincing . it actually made me a bit EMOANGERDISGUSTNEGATIVE , because it focuses on EMOFEARPOSITIVETRUST deaths form two years ago and does n't take into EMOTRUST current figures . also , by focusing on deaths alone , it EMOPOSITIVE glosses over injuries to paint a picture that policing is EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST in the current climate . it feels a lot like EMONEGATIVE news to me . all you have to do is EMOPOSITIVE up the paper to see how often cops are involved in fights with criminals and EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS people .
it aggravates me that in our modern society leaders are condemned before they even have an EMOANTICIPATIONPOSITIVE to EMOPOSITIVE . it will EMOANTICIPATION forevermore into the future no matter who wins elections from here on out . the issue is not EMOANGERNEGATIVE so much as it is the EMOPOSITIVE to EMOPOSITIVE against someone anymore . using the internet , it is quite easy to gather a group of thousands and perhaps even hundreds of thousands to EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVE against something vile or EMONEGATIVE . the EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS is EMOSURPRISE was n't even given a EMOSURPRISE . now that things have played out , perhaps some of those people were right about their hatred or grievances but its entirely EMOANGERDISGUSTNEGATIVESADNESS to EMONEGATIVE any EMOPOSITIVETRUST of our country to this before they have even been given the EMOSURPRISE to EMOPOSITIVE .
i really think racism is getting out of hand lately . i do n't understand why people have to commit hate crimes against people that they are n't similar to . everyone deserves to live a EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST life without being assaulted or EMONEGATIVESADNESS that they 'll be assaulted . and chalking it up to EMOTRUST is even EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS . people do n't have to be so easily EMOANGERNEGATIVESADNESS these days , but they are , and they 're hate filled while they 're EMOANGERNEGATIVESADNESS too .
i EMOPOSITIVE with this article EMOPOSITIVE . i used to take the EMOPOSITIVETRUST for awhile and it did EMOFEAR my moods and make me feel EMODISGUSTNEGATIVE and just off . so i switched to the dope shot and same thing . it made me feel super EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS and also made me EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVE a lot of weight . i have had some EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST of bad side effect with every birth control i 've ever tried . i EMONEGATIVE to take any form of birth control now except for condoms and i EMOANTICIPATION my cycle so i know when i 'm EMOPOSITIVE .
" i do n't know who this celebrity is , but is n't this EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS ? of course it 'd EMOANTICIPATION in florida ! we always hear these " " florida man " " stories , and here 's another one . what are people thinking , anyway ? what was this guy hoping to do ? EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST EMODISGUSTNEGATIVE world we live in nowadays . i 'd never want to live down there with all the EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS stuff that goes on ! "
according to a new EMOPOSITIVE , the polar regions are continuing to melt . in a decade , a lot of the ice melted . this situation is really affecting polar bears because they live in that environment . i EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST out that they EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESURPRISE EMOTRUST as they come up out of the water . whether we can EMOFEAR this EMOPOSITIVE or not , i am not sure about but we should try .
EMOSURPRISE is a EMODISGUSTNEGATIVE . climate EMOFEAR is EMOPOSITIVETRUST and it 's starting to effect us directly . i wonder when he 'll realize we have to do something . how much does it take ? maybe his golf curse has to EMOSURPRISE EMOFEAR just like the forests . this does n't only effect us but the whole world and the life on it . EMOPOSITIVETRUST states needs to take EMOPOSITIVE before it 's too EMONEGATIVESADNESS .
i have think is very good article and nice.he has promised the to be the most EMOFEARPOSITIVETRUST interrogator of the obama administration from his perch on an EMONEGATIVE EMOTRUST , which republican cheered . this sentence i am very like . numerous EMOANTICIPATIONPOSITIVETRUST initiatives focused on EMOPOSITIVE caused could also give republican few reasons to turn out . the EMOPOSITIVE must EMOPOSITIVETRUST for the areas .
i just read an article about some EMOPOSITIVE - head who used a hammer and a EMOPOSITIVE ax to destroy donald EMOSURPRISE 's EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST on the hollywood walk of EMOPOSITIVE . wow , what a great protest . you sure showed him . good EMOPOSITIVE . lola , can you believe this EMODISGUSTNEGATIVE ? who has such a EMONEGATIVESADNESS and EMODISGUSTNEGATIVESADNESS life that they do n't have anything better to do with their EMOANTICIPATION than commit EMONEGATIVE vandalism because they EMOANGERDISGUSTNEGATIVE some politician ? what a dingus .
how can people take something like relationships for EMOPOSITIVE ? it 's infuriating that in a world where i have to EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVE for the right to marry the person i EMOJOYPOSITIVE and EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST and want to pamper and cherish and EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST a life with that there are assholes out there like this with EMOANGERNEGATIVE issues who will get in their alleged EMOPOSITIVE 's face and EMOANGERSURPRISE . the hate is just mind blowing .
these EMOPOSITIVE EMONEGATIVESADNESSSURPRISE little room to think that climate EMOFEAR is not happening . as you know , i firmly believe in the EMOANTICIPATIONPOSITIVE of environmental protections and think climate EMOFEAR is a EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS . however , articles like this only add to the EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS . these EMOPOSITIVE are shocking on the surface but could easily be explained by natural fluctuations year to year . i wish they would EMOPOSITIVE on EMOPOSITIVE science instead .
i saw a story about yemen today . have you read about it . it looks like ethnic EMOPOSITIVE over there . it is so awful EMOFEARNEGATIVE about EMOPOSITIVETRUST people being killed just because of where they are from . it 's like nazi germany in some parts of the world . it is very scary to me . nobody is really doing anything but making proclamations . rights groups ca n't seem to do anything either . i wish these evil people would stop doing this .
water parks and EMOJOYPOSITIVE parks in EMOPOSITIVETRUST are just disasters waiting to EMOANTICIPATION . we truly do n't know how EMOFEARNEGATIVE some of these things are until something goes EMONEGATIVE . then we all see what was so EMOPOSITIVETRUST yet EMONEGATIVESADNESS to see until pointed out . i am going to EMOFEARNEGATIVE these places like the EMODISGUSTFEARNEGATIVESADNESS . plus life is too short to EMOANTICIPATIONNEGATIVE in EMOFEAR .
so i feel birth is birth . what difference does it make it you gave it vaginal or c - section . so people can be so evil in this world . you were pregnant and carried that EMOJOYPOSITIVE in your belly for 8 to 9 months . some ladies are faced with a life or death even EMOPOSITIVE . we have to do what is right for our babies but mostly for ourselves . i know you think wow EMOANGERDISGUSTNEGATIVE much , no this i why . if you are not here you can not raise and EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST EMOPOSITIVE family . next if you are not your best or at 100 % you really can not give your all .
there has been talks on how this is an agenda that is being pushed right now , just like the massive shootings right now . people are just EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS EMOPOSITIVETRUST people no matter what the color of there skin is although people are always going to find a way to make it a racial matter or discuss how its EMONEGATIVE or how the person was a racist but the only one who knows that is the person who commuted the act .
hey , i know you asked me about what happened to that mother and her EMOJOYPOSITIVE in new york and here 's the EMOPOSITIVE article . it 's so sad ... that EMOJOYPOSITIVE could have lived their life to the fullest and now it 's cut short . the mother will have to EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS over what happened to ... it 's so sad that things like this EMOANTICIPATION .
EMOPOSITIVE this article makes me feel sad for many EMOPOSITIVE . i myself have no idea why those countries are always at EMOFEARNEGATIVE and why so many people are loosing their lives . it also makes me sad to imagine myself in a situation where i am EMOTRUST in EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVE of my life . with so many being EMONEGATIVESADNESS already it makes me sad to think about these things continually happening .
hello , i will tell you something , an article i read recently , said that millions of nigerians survived biko hiram , but now a humanitarian catastrophe is putting their lives at EMOANTICIPATIONFEARNEGATIVE again , EMOPOSITIVE about this EMOPOSITIVE i think it is more EMOPOSITIVETRUST EMOPOSITIVE than it seems be , i would consider that it is a news that should EMOANTICIPATION even by television
" EMOSURPRISE and putin EMOPOSITIVE about syria in EMOPOSITIVE terms but then russian warships bomb aleppo , the bombing said to be for " " EMOTRUST . " " a EMOTRUST that is EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS the city and its people . this is really EMOSURPRISE . at least we are getting some reporting about it , even though it 's just frustrating since we ca n't really do anything , and EMOSURPRISE is looking the other way . the syrian problems seem likely to drag down the world for years to come . "
some of the drivers around this place need to be taken out of their cars and arrested . some people were struck on highway 80 near chunky . some kids were involved . i think three people died . they were riding on the back of a trailer EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVE halloween . a vehicle collided with the trailer probably a drunk . i think they were just in a EMOANTICIPATION like everyone else around here . i EMOSURPRISE that driver is going to get it .
the EMOPOSITIVETRUST EMOFEARTRUST of thumb is that to be EMOPOSITIVE individuals need to get a EMONEGATIVE of eight hours of sleep a night . some people get more , and some people get along well with less , but everyone needs to get enough sleep or else they can not function effectively in their everyday activities . in their work , your EMOPOSITIVETRUST to a EMOPOSITIVE sleep , national institutes of health pointed out that sleep is very EMOPOSITIVETRUST to human EMOPOSITIVE , so EMOPOSITIVETRUST that one - third of a person ’s life is EMONEGATIVE doing it ( 1 ) . in sleep , sleep disorders , and biological rhythms , tamerlane said , “ sleep is a required activity , not an EMOPOSITIVE ” ( 19 ) . during sleep the human body has an EMOANTICIPATIONPOSITIVE to recuperate from the activities of the day . the recuperation goes beyond they
i feel sorry for this person 's family . his children now have no EMOTRUST . you just never know what makes people commit terrible acts of evil . life can be taken in the blink of an eye . you need to make sure all your loved ones know how much you care , do as much good in the world as you can , because you never know when your last day on this earth is going to be .
this article i just read was so , unbelievably sad and EMONEGATIVE . this EMOSURPRISE is so EMOANGERDISGUSTFEARNEGATIVE . such a EMODISGUSTNEGATIVE death . i ca n't imagine being that two year old and EMONEGATIVESADNESS for so EMOANTICIPATION . ugh , it makes me so EMOANGERNEGATIVESADNESS . i feel so bad for the parents , they must feel so EMOANGERNEGATIVESADNESS . it would be so hard to overcome everything .
if you are wearing contacts for your EMOANTICIPATIONPOSITIVE to EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST then you should be sure to take them out when sleeping . you can get some EMODISGUSTFEARNEGATIVESADNESS in your eye that will accumulate and might cause problems if you do not do this . i forgot what the thing was called but it might even cause the EMOPOSITIVE user to become EMONEGATIVE .
what a freaking EMOANGERDISGUSTNEGATIVE ! guys are so creepy sometimes . and in our own home state . i wonder who he gave them to to release them out to the EMOANTICIPATIONPOSITIVE . anyway , please be EMOPOSITIVE with your photos and EMOPOSITIVE . i 've been seeing more and more EMOTRUST like this popping up , and i would hate to see any of our sensitive data at EMOANTICIPATIONFEARNEGATIVE . stay EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST out there .
i do n't know about bach . i EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST of wish he had n't run again ; i 'm EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVE he 's not trying again this EMOANTICIPATION . after EMOPOSITIVE this story , it 's hard to feel sympathetic , even in retrospect . but the story confuses me , too . did n't bach used to work for fox news after he EMONEGATIVE the EMOTRUST ? the story does n't even mention that . and it talks about how he was EMOPOSITIVE for the banks but also embraced obama 's position on banks , which seem like mutually exclusive things . he did n't do anything great in the EMOTRUST , but when he was EMOTRUST , he saved that lady 's EMOJOYPOSITIVE 's college EMOANTICIPATIONPOSITIVE . it 's all very confusing , but overall , i 'm EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVE he 's staying gone .
hey , this is some sad news . the rhino could n't be saved from his EMODISGUSTFEARNEGATIVESADNESS diseases , so he had to be put down . i feel bad for the animal as he or she did n't have to live this way . in addition , it was EMOFEAR to find treatment for the rhino , so i feel bad for the veterinarians that had to take care of the rhino .
i can not believe this ! how can they do this to people ? they have less than a week to move out after some of them being there for over 10 years . i am just saddened that political and ideological EMOANGERNEGATIVE will EMOANGERNEGATIVE not only EMOPOSITIVETRUST from EMOPOSITIVE , but for students to be able to have a quality education . what can we do to help ? let me know if you know what we can rally against .
i 'm not sure what the gay EMOPOSITIVE hoped to EMOJOYPOSITIVE by holding a gay EMOJOYPOSITIVE event in a country where EMONEGATIVE is illegal . it 's not like people there EMONEGATIVE such a EMOTRUST , since someone was powerful enough to criminalize sexual preference in the first place . i think i would rather stay under the EMOTRUST until i could find a more EMOPOSITIVE place to live .
i always wonder whether to believe articles like this . i have always liked may weather , and i feel there are probably two sides to this story . besides , the lawsuit is filed but there is no EMOFEAR yet , so may weather could be EMOPOSITIVETRUST . anyone can file a lawsuit and the only EMOTRUST of who is right is when the suit is decided . i will be interested to follow the EMOPOSITIVE of this one .
hey , i was just EMOPOSITIVE an article about that house EMOFEAR that happened in wv . can you imagine the EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS ? that is such a EMOANGERDISGUSTFEARNEGATIVE way to EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS . and to think that two of the victims were children plus their dog . it makes me ill just thinking about it . such a huge EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS for that family and the EMOPOSITIVE . i hope officials find out soon what caused it and i pray for the friends and family of those who were killed . so sad !
are you aware that only certain refuges are helped and accepted ? i ca n't imagine the heart EMOSURPRISE that they EMOPOSITIVE EMOPOSITIVE so far thinking they are EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST to be turned around and EMONEGATIVESADNESS . the whole EMOTRUST is so flawed . there is no appropriate help for these people ! they have so many EMOANGERDISGUSTNEGATIVESADNESS hurdles to go through .
here is an article for you . it 's an old one , obviously . i am so EMODISGUSTNEGATIVESADNESS of republicans . they are a EMOFEARNEGATIVE , spineless bunch who EMONEGATIVESADNESS in line behind EMOSURPRISE every EMOANTICIPATION . let 's hope they get a EMOPOSITIVE EMONEGATIVE whooping in november . but this article demonstrates how we ca n't take anything for EMOPOSITIVE . i remember back then , when all the polls showing wins for hillary and the democrats . i have n't trusted the polls since then , and i know you do n't EMOTRUST them either . and who knows what the russians are going to do this EMOANTICIPATION around ? no one has tried to stop them , so why would n't they try to interfere in our elections again ? we have to keep an eye out and do whatever we can to make sure there 's no funny business at the polls in november .
" russia claims EMODISGUSTNEGATIVE un EMOPOSITIVE convoy was ' escorted by terrorists a un EMOPOSITIVE convoy that was EMODISGUSTNEGATIVE on monday night was escorted by a " " terrorists " " , russia has claimed in response to accusations it was behind the deadly attacks . moscow has EMONEGATIVESADNESS hitting the un convoy , which was EMODISGUSTNEGATIVE as it delivered EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST EMOPOSITIVE to EMOANGERNEGATIVE - held parts of aleppo on monday night , minutes after the EMOFEAR declared the end of a ceasefire . the strikes , carried out by either syrian or EMOPOSITIVETRUST russian warplanes , EMOANGERNEGATIVE syrian red crescent trucks as staff members were unloading EMOPOSITIVE in rem al - kubra in aleppo province . more than a dozen were killed EMOPOSITIVE omar barbara , the organization ’s EMOPOSITIVETRUST . pictures shared by activists showed burned bodies next to a unhurt EMOTRUST . russia 's defense EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST re lea "
this makes me very EMOANGERNEGATIVESADNESS . they do n't want to take responsibility , blames it on something else . it 's clearly your EMONEGATIVESADNESS and you should feel EMOANGERNEGATIVESADNESS for EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS all these people . they have every right to EMOANGERNEGATIVESADNESS you for your EMONEGATIVE EMONEGATIVESADNESS . we live in a world with idiots . next EMOANTICIPATION you take the car to work , remember that you ca n't EMOPOSITIVETRUST yourself to be EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST if you are EMOPOSITIVE .
this article about the philippines EMOPOSITIVE is very EMOFEARNEGATIVESURPRISE . it is a EMODISGUSTFEARNEGATIVESADNESS that so many people resort to EMODISGUSTNEGATIVE and bad deeds . it is also EMONEGATIVESADNESS that it had to end in casualties . people should really evaluate their behavior and how it impacts others . i would not want to go EMOPOSITIVE there if this is how they behave !
it 's EMODISGUSTFEARNEGATIVESADNESS to see a dog EMONEGATIVESADNESS to such a cruel EMOANTICIPATIONNEGATIVE . this brings EMOPOSITIVE to the numerous other cases of fatalism that would 've been prevented by EMOPOSITIVE inspection and care for one 's pets . dogs deserve better from us , and it 's our obligation as human beings to EMOPOSITIVETRUST care for animals as much as possible .
i just read an article about elephants and how they are becoming EMONEGATIVESADNESS due to people being more EMOFEARSADNESS towards their need fr ivory than they are for the EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVESURPRISE lives of elephants . i do n't understand why people have such little regards for the well being of the elephant species , EMOPOSITIVE that they are on the EMOANTICIPATIONFEARNEGATIVE of extinction and it upsets me severely EMOPOSITIVE that we are taking them for EMOPOSITIVE .
france has been through a lot of EMODISGUSTNEGATIVE lately . some terrorists stormed a newspaper office and killed some people ; their have been bombings at the airports and train stations ; and a little girl was among 90 killed during a concert at one of their local venues . as sad as this all is , the most EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVE thing is that the country has decided to activate additional measures to ensure their EMOPOSITIVE is maintained . this always seems to be the EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS during a EMOANTICIPATION of great EMOFEARNEGATIVE and unrest- most of which are incited by officials EMOPOSITIVE within the EMOFEARNEGATIVE itself .
arnold palmer was really a great and ambitious guy , he really did a monumental EMOFEAR nohow today 's television sports work , and the EMOTRUST that he died was EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST saddening to me . i think that the legacy he left behind is amazing , and he will EMOANTICIPATIONPOSITIVETRUST to EMONEGATIVEPOSITIVE us even after his death . i would EMOJOYPOSITIVE to see arnold palmer 's company thrive EMOPOSITIVE over the next couple of decades , and EMOANTICIPATIONPOSITIVETRUST to transpire within the people he has influenced in his life .
EMOPOSITIVE EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST , i have just finished EMOPOSITIVE a very EMOPOSITIVE and somewhat disturbing article . it was about thomas arthur , an EMODISGUSTFEARNEGATIVE on death EMOANGERNEGATIVE in alabama . there began a massive EMOPOSITIVETRUST EMOANGERNEGATIVE between the courts , justices , and lawyers about the legality and EMOPOSITIVETRUST of EMODISGUSTFEARNEGATIVESADNESS EMOFEAR practices . i feel conflicted because on one hand , these people EMOPOSITIVETRUST EMOANGERDISGUSTFEARNEGATIVE crimes and deserve severe EMOANGERDISGUSTFEARNEGATIVE , but on the other hand , taking a life may still not be EMOPOSITIVETRUST .
nicolas mauro is the current EMOPOSITIVETRUST of venezuela and it has led to EMOPOSITIVE issues and divide in the country . the country is EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST much EMOANGERDISGUSTFEARNEGATIVE at this point and the EMOFEARNEGATIVE is over - reaching into everyone 's lives . EMOPOSITIVE about the protests and issues going on makes me feel EMOPOSITIVE to be out of that country . i really hope the people can EMOANGERNEGATIVESADNESS him and replace it with a better EMOFEARNEGATIVE .
did you hear about the three people who died on halloween night ? it happened in mississippi on a highway . someone EMOANGERNEGATIVE a trailer that was pulling people on a highway . several people were EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS , but three were killed . authorities say that the three killed were EMOTRUST to one another . that is so sad and breaks my heart . it was most likely a family , a mother and her kids , or a EMOTRUST and his kids . it really makes me sad when i read about it because i can not help but imagine how much EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVE and EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVESURPRISE this family was experiencing before the EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESSSURPRISE happened . the article did not say if the driver who caused the EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESSSURPRISE was drunk or on drugs . i wish people were more alert while on the road . accidents like this are EMOPOSITIVE preventable . and now three people are no longer with us .
this article was about the disturbing finds by the iraqi EMOFEAR as they re - captured territory from retreating islamic state fighters . they EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST mass graves of people killed by isis and although there is some EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVE about the details , there are dozens or maybe over 100 bodies . there is also evidence of torture . the isis fighters were certainly EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVE towards their victims , and have captured many more to use as human shields or to EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS outright for their perceived beliefs .
the EMOTRUST that so many people still EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS of smoking deaths is EMONEGATIVE . with so much EMOPOSITIVE these days we should be able to EMOPOSITIVE people about the EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS associated with smoking and EMOFEAR this pattern ! and the EMOTRUST that the who recommends taxation at 75 percent of retail cost and no states do this is EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS !
i read this article about a bus that was EMOANGERNEGATIVE a random car from out of nowhere . the bus was parked and the car just plowed into it . it 's EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST of fucked up but typical . a few people were hospitalized but no one died . anyways their investigating the EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESSSURPRISE . these types of incidents EMOANTICIPATION so often i 'm rather EMONEGATIVE to their effects .
this was heartbreaking to read . i ca n't imagine what it 's like to EMONEGATIVESADNESSSURPRISE the house every day not EMOPOSITIVE if you will come back , or of living in EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVE of letting your children EMONEGATIVESADNESSSURPRISE the house to go to EMOTRUST because they might not make it home . civilians should not have to EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVE for their lives when they 're just trying to get through the day . it sickens me that the us has participated in strikes that EMOPOSITIVE to such consequences .
i really think this is quite sad . poor people have the same sort of problems all over the world . i think this is because the rich are always keeping people down . i think that they EMONEGATIVE like everything is a racial EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS , but i EMOFEARNEGATIVE that the problems we face are largely because the rich are EMODISGUSTNEGATIVE rich and they have no EMOPOSITIVE for the EMOPOSITIVE of us .
i have not heard of this story , but wanted to see if you knew anything about it . i know we were talking the other day about being EMONEGATIVESADNESS about getting stuck in a situation like this because of all the recent shootings . i think this story was a EMOPOSITIVETRUST eye opener for me , because it shows just how easy something like this happening would be . i feel that what you said about mental health and paying more EMOPOSITIVE to the youth is really another central point to this story . this story made me think even more about owning a EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVE and having a open carry permit to keep EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST and be able to EMOPOSITIVE my loved ones and family .
i ca n't stand these jenner and EMOPOSITIVETRUST . but i have to give them EMOPOSITIVETRUST for making a living from doing nothing . i EMOSURPRISE that is the new american dream ! t hey are EMOPOSITIVE a product that people want to consume . is n't that EMODISGUSTNEGATIVESADNESS ? the EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS thing is that this family is going to become the normal and accepted family environment .
i am so EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVE that i 'm not a celebrity having my every move made EMOANTICIPATIONPOSITIVE and being analyzed . it would be awful to be under that EMOPOSITIVETRUST and never ending EMONEGATIVE . the EMOANTICIPATION of being under the EMOPOSITIVETRUST EMOPOSITIVETRUST eye of the world , and them profiting from a me having a bad day makes my EMODISGUST turn . i feel bad for him in a way , i 've had a few rocky relationships and i could n't imagine going through them publicly .
i think they should both be charged with murder . it 's EMOPOSITIVETRUST at least one of them did it but i 'm assuming both . it 's EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS what this world has come to people just EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS people all the EMOANTICIPATION and usually for no EMOPOSITIVE . it 's EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS and people need to be punished harsher . if you EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS someone on person for no EMOPOSITIVE you should automatically get the death sentence .
well , this certainly is rich and EMODISGUSTNEGATIVESADNESS . the muslims and their terrorist mouthpiece EMOANTICIPATIONPOSITIVETRUST on american - islamic relations are all whiny that someone tried to do to them what they have been doing to everyone else all over the world . never hear a EMOPOSITIVETRUST out of them when they 're blowing up cars and EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVE up EMOPOSITIVETRUST people in the streets do you ?
the person in the article was participating in a fund raising event and the event was about getting pies thrown into the faces by people . i EMOSURPRISE that things got a little bit rough because the guy that was getting the pie in the face got EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS somehow . it was EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST bad and he had to EMOANTICIPATION out the EMOANTICIPATIONFEARPOSITIVETRUST help for the injuries to his face .
this situation i read about concerning refugees fleeing to EMOPOSITIVE countries such as greece and italy is sad and concerns me . clearly the conditions in their native countries have gotten to be so EMODISGUSTNEGATIVESADNESS that they are willing to EMOANTICIPATIONFEARNEGATIVE their own and their families ' lives to try for a different life in another country , with no EMOPOSITIVETRUST that life there would be an EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST . its EMOFEAR to understand . life must be so terrible in these countries due to horrendous governance , which i suppose is something EMOFEAR for the typical american to picture . i 'm EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVE that we live in a country where there are EMOTRUST freedoms and the individual and his or her family can live independently and get their needs met and wants . living in EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVE is no way to live .
the girl with the EMOJOYPOSITIVE EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST eyes that was pictured years ago by a photographer is currently under EMONEGATIVE for falsifying documents to stay in pakistan . i feel bad for this woman who felt a need to EMOANGERDISGUSTNEGATIVESADNESS about her EMOPOSITIVE of citizenship to stay in a country just to EMOANTICIPATIONPOSITIVETRUST living a better life . this is the second EMOANTICIPATION she has been arrested which shows me that she is really trying to EMOANTICIPATIONFEARNEGATIVEPOSITIVE a EMOFEARNEGATIVE ravaged country and to EMOANTICIPATIONPOSITIVETRUST on living a better life . they should let the girl go . good for the original photographer who is trying to help her out of this situation .
wow , it is scary to think there are mice that are twice their normal size EMOANGERANTICIPATIONFEARNEGATIVE down and EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS birds ! it must be one scary place there right now with all that carnage . i hope keith can make his EMOANTICIPATION come EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST and stop the EMOANGERNEGATIVE of the mice . my concern is if they EMOANTICIPATION getting off the island and migrating to other places . i live far away in america , but i sure do n't want to run across these EMOFEAR bird - eating mice . no thanks !
this shows how the current political environment is effecting people , especially EMOPOSITIVE people , emotionally . the EMONEGATIVE and EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVE that is being shown from the EMOPOSITIVE generation is mostly to EMOANGERDISGUSTNEGATIVE on social media . we used to be able to discuss political issues in person , calmly . now , if you try to mention your opinion on social media , you run the EMOANTICIPATIONFEARNEGATIVE of being attacked or insulted , simply adding to the EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVE of the current political situations .
bullying is such a serious issue . it has been going on for so EMOANTICIPATION . it is so sad that these EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVESURPRISE people have to take their life because they think there is no end in sight . what we need to do along with EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST therapy for those that are bullied is to EMOPOSITIVE the consequences for those who are bullying others . this may have happened in europe but in america teachers know this bullying is going on and they tend to EMOPOSITIVE the EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVE players and other jocks . it is really sad . i hope you have never been bullied . i was and it was terrible .
wow how sad is this news ? i 'm EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVE that people rallied together to help those people at least . this really reminds me of when i lived in texas and everyone was having their homes and EMOPOSITIVE ruined by EMONEGATIVESURPRISE fires that went out of control . people EMONEGATIVESADNESS everything but luckily everyone really teamed up to help each other .
oh my goodness , did you read this article ? it was heart - wrenching ... i felt so sad while EMOPOSITIVE it and my heart breaks for the mother of these babies . there is no way that a parent should ever , ever have to lose a EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVE , much less two children at the same EMOANTICIPATION . so EMODISGUSTFEARNEGATIVESADNESS and sad ! something has to be done about all of this . they deserve EMOPOSITIVETRUST ! !
i just do n't know how they could do this to that poor girl . after everything she has been through . i really feel for her . i understand what she might be going through . it is a EMODISGUSTFEARNEGATIVESADNESS to have this EMOANTICIPATION after all this EMOANTICIPATION . i really hope that someone will be able to help her . i feel really bad about what is being done . i am EMONEGATIVESADNESS about what might EMOANTICIPATION if she does n't get any help . they really should just let her go .
every EMOANTICIPATION i hear something about isis , i ca n't help but think about the role the us played in its creation and the EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS that have come from the vacuum of power in the region . i 'm EMOJOYPOSITIVE to be american when i read something like this , but also EMODISGUSTNEGATIVESADNESS at the same EMOANTICIPATION in who we 've EMOPOSITIVE to represent us , not just now , but over the past 30 years .
i ca n't believe that there has to be so much EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS and bad in the world . the part of this article that really got to me was that the muslim women were being raped and that doctors and nurses who wanted to help the people there were being treated rudely . it would be awful to have to live under these kinds of conditions . it would be awful to have the prices of EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST go up because of blockades and other reasons . it would be stressful and scary .
hello , EMOPOSITIVE group . let 's EMOTRUST in the laws of our country and in truly just judgments . hopefully the murderer EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVE of five counts of murder will not be free and EMOPOSITIVESADNESS in the streets of this country . i hope that EMOPOSITIVETRUST can compensate a little to the relatives of the EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS . after a 24 - hour EMONEGATIVE the EMOFEARPOSITIVETRUST EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST the EMOANGERDISGUSTFEARNEGATIVE and even though the victims have not been recognized , they will soon discover who they are .
can you imagine what EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST of EMONEGATIVESADNESS these people must be going through ? i do n't know what it would be like to have to live in EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVE that your own country is going to be EMODISGUSTNEGATIVE , let alone EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVESURPRISE a messages basically telling you that if you do n't get out now you could EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS from a bombing . EMOANGER is making life so hard for so many EMOPOSITIVETRUST people .
a lot of these news go unnoticed i feel . we have EMOFEARNEGATIVE in syria and EMOFEARNEGATIVE everywhere . we have accepted it as a part of the world . it 's such a EMODISGUSTFEARNEGATIVESADNESS that it 's like this . EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS has always EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS us down and it 's never been necessary . i do n't know for how EMOANTICIPATION this EMOFEARNEGATIVE has to EMOANTICIPATIONPOSITIVETRUST . but i really feel sorry for all the lives that 's been EMONEGATIVESADNESS in this EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS .
wow , EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS someone in EMOANTICIPATIONPOSITIVE ? that takes some serious EMOPOSITIVE . i do n't particularly know whether she is EMOANGERNEGATIVESADNESS or not , but for it to be played out in the media is n't EMOPOSITIVE . while they may not have the same protections that the EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVE have in the EMOPOSITIVETRUST states , they should still give her a new trial , something EMOPOSITIVESADNESS , out of the EMOANTICIPATIONPOSITIVE eye , maybe even outside of the country , where she can get a EMOPOSITIVE trial based on the EMOPOSITIVETRUST . if there is video of her spiking the coffee , or any indication that she has had any EMOPOSITIVE with EMOFEARNEGATIVE , then i say she should get a retrial .
i think EMOPOSITIVETRUST has been served one way or another . this person seemed like a EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS to society . i think it 's only right they should meet their end in this fashion . people like this should be removed from society before they do something that will EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS others . i feel bad for anyone who was in EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS from this mad man .
" i can not believe canada took so many native people and put them in their " " EMOPOSITIVE " " schools . they took away their language and their EMOTRUST . and on EMOANTICIPATIONPOSITIVETRUST of all that 6000 died ! plus many were abused ! this is EMOANGERDISGUSTFEARNEGATIVE ! i am so EMOANGERNEGATIVESADNESS by this ! i mean seriously ? how could they do that ! and the worst part is that was still going on all the way up to 1996 ! ! ! that is EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVE ! and they only apologized in 2008 . way too EMONEGATIVESADNESS . i mean the EMOFEARNEGATIVE they did to these children is massive . they need to make up for what they have done ! "
i think it is EMOPOSITIVETRUST to ensure EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST drivers on our roads , for our family ’s sake . i believe that the rate of accidents on american roads is far higher than EMOPOSITIVE . i believe there should be more EMONEGATIVE driving requirements and testing , as well as harsher punishments for drivers who do not EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST the riles of the road .
what a rare occurrence to have that mutation come up for both parents . i feel very bad for nicholas and his family . thankfully they are able to EMOPOSITIVE the treatments that nicholas would need almost his entire life . i feel bad for the family who are n't able to EMOPOSITIVE such treatments for their own kids .
i just read a really sad story about a kid who got EMONEGATIVESADNESS while hiking in vietnam . you should read it . it 's frustrating because he made a number of very basic errors that even the EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVESURPRISE kids in my scouting group know to EMOFEARNEGATIVE . he was alone . he lacked EMOPOSITIVE EMOPOSITIVE to EMOPOSITIVE changes in weather . he did not know his route . when he got EMONEGATIVESADNESS , he kept moving instead of staying put . he also failed to let rescuers come to him . he could very easily have been stayed if he had made all of these EMONEGATIVESADNESS s and just stayed put . i hope his EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST does n't feel too much EMODISGUSTNEGATIVESADNESS over this . it 's not her EMONEGATIVESADNESS but judging from the article , she blames herself . i ca n't imagine what his parents are going through . my mom is always EMONEGATIVESADNESS when i go backpacking and she 'd go EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS if anything like this happened to me .
that really EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS that a woman would actually push another person on to train tracks based off a EMOANGERNEGATIVESADNESS . i get that you guys do n't EMOPOSITIVE with something but that does n't give you the right to take a persons life . i feel so sorry for the victims family because they EMONEGATIVESADNESS a EMOPOSITIVE family member over some EMONEGATIVE EMOANGERNEGATIVE that would probably be EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS the next day . truly a EMONEGATIVE story that should be a EMOPOSITIVE situation for anyone with a EMOANGERNEGATIVESADNESS with another individual .
the article says that - shannon daugherty shares her cancer story with chelsea handler in emotional , tear - filled interview — shannon daugherty recalled what it ’s like to be diagnosed with cancer in an emotional new interview with chelsea handler . during the sit - down , set to air on handler ’s netflix EMOTRUST , chelsea , the actress holds back tears while revealing what she ’s learned through her health EMONEGATIVE . “ i think what ’s EMOJOYPOSITIVE and hard and EMOPOSITIVE about cancer is that it tears you down and builds you , and tears you down and builds you , ” the beverly hills , 90210alum says in the clip . “ it remakes you so many different times . the person i EMOANTICIPATION i was supposed to be or was going to be or who i EMOANTICIPATION i was six months ago is now somebody EMOPOSITIVE different . i realize ,
ga. the whole kr$ha EMODISGUSTNEGATIVE . oops , i man keisha , without the $ sign . i dunno what to think about the eating EMOFEARNEGATIVE and whole rehab thing . her EMOPOSITIVETRUST life has been such a EMOPOSITIVE sh*show , it 's really hard to me to believe that this is anything else than EMOPOSITIVE - seeking . she just seems to have that EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST of personality .
wow sleep paralysis sounds so scary ! i hope that this never happens to me ! i think that it was affect me for a EMOANTICIPATION EMOANTICIPATION . i 'm sure that those few short seconds that is happens seems like hours . i would probably have a heart EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVE from being so scared . yeah no thank you on any of that . i will be making sure i do n't drink before going to bed from now on .
hi , i have learned that syria ’s EMOFEARNEGATIVE escalated abruptly on friday . EMOFEARNEGATIVE forces and their russian allies launched EMOANGERDISGUSTFEARNEGATIVE aerial assaults on aleppo . repeated airstrikes EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS buildings and engulfed neighborhoods , and flames killed about 100 people there . what is gained with this senseless EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS ?
i dint even EMONEGATIVE EMOPOSITIVE this . i skimmed it . it 's a EMONEGATIVESADNESS EMONEGATIVE . why in writing you to tell you this is beyond me , but my masters here believe it will be revealing in some way . and in nothing if not a EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS to my masters . so i write . to you , my friends . i hope you will find more meaningful things to read and do than this EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST of EMODISGUSTNEGATIVE .
" and yet the deniers still claim that there is no EMOPOSITIVETRUST basis for the claim of human EMOANGER . i bet some of them will latch onto the e nina contribution to " " EMOPOSITIVE " " that it 's just the randomness of nature . however , they will fail to understand that it 's only a random amplification of the effects that we a directly EMOPOSITIVETRUST for by spewing so much co2 in to the atmosphere . we wo n't get them to act until people are literally dying in the street . "
i just read an article about famed EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVE EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST , scottie pippin . someone EMOANTICIPATION it was new EMOPOSITIVETRUST to make the world aware that he and his wife got into a EMOANGERDISGUSTFEARNEGATIVE match and she was EMOFEARNEGATIVE . the EMOPOSITIVETRUST is , no one but their family knows what 's really going on . his wife could be a very dramatic person . she could be EMOPOSITIVE him a hard EMOANTICIPATION . while domestic EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS and emotional abuse should never be tolerated , we should EMONEGATIVESADNESSSURPRISE people to deal with their own EMOANGERDISGUSTFEARNEGATIVE matches .
these are problems that us solider had to deal with for many year . hell , you could even go back much , much further if you want to . EMOFEARNEGATIVE is hell , and it can -- and often does -- do a EMOANGERNEGATIVE to your psyche and overall mental health . that 's why we as a society need to pump more EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST into mental health as we do physical health .
say , bigots ! i know that bigots are not a particularly new species , but i used to think , just a few years ago , that things were much better and that people were generally becoming more open - minded and welcoming . but the election of our new EMOPOSITIVETRUST signals something very different . and very much encourages the bigots to spread their wings and parade proudly . they are being empowered right now , and that is very disturbing .
there have just been so many different tragedies involving the sinking of migrant boats that the people who live in western countries have become immunized to the images . i just wonder how people so close by in european countries can have an anti - EMOSADNESS position ( though they call them migrants ) when the evidence of EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS is before them every year since the syrian EMOFEARNEGATIVE heated up . i think it is really just EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS .
i canto believe that there are citizens in this EMOTRUST , particularly in minnesota , who are vulnerable enough to be manipulated by isis to EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS individuals in their country . the somali group in minnesota has a history ( several known cases ) of people attempting to commit murder for the terrorist group . tragically , an somali man has just gone on a murder EMONEGATIVE . he has not been linked to isis and his motivations are unclear , but i am EMOANGERNEGATIVESADNESS .
wow , what a EMOANGERDISGUSTFEARNEGATIVE and terrifying EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESSSURPRISE , i feel very bad for the people involved and their families . i wonder what caused this terrible EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESSSURPRISE , i hope that it was not any human EMONEGATIVESADNESS , because that makes it EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS to deal with . i can not imagine being on that train and the intensity of the EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESSSURPRISE . it makes me feel very sad thinking about the deaths of those people on EMOANTICIPATION .
it 's one thing to EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS another person with a EMOPOSITIVE . but who kills horses and animals ? ! they are EMOPOSITIVE EMOPOSITIVETRUST creatures . god we have used and abused these animals for centuries . i have no idea what EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST of EMOPOSITIVE this killer has . these horses deserve so much more . it 's almost EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS than murder in my opinion . i really hope this guy gets caught .
i just read a story about a EMONEGATIVESADNESS man named terence crutches who was shot and killed by a EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST EMOFEARPOSITIVETRUST EMOPOSITIVETRUST named betty shelby in tulsa oklahoma . she was responding to another call when she noticed terence crutches . the camera on her dashboard showed that terence had his hands up . it was also video tapped by a helicopter . the EMOPOSITIVETRUST claimed she felt like her life was in EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS . terence was a good man with a good heart . he was a churchgoer and a EMOTRUST of four children . hundreds of people mourned his passing . if convicted betty shelby age 42 could face 4 years in EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS for first EMOPOSITIVE manslaughter .
" EMOPOSITIVE issue : " " EMOPOSITIVE : more toddlers and preschoolers are overdosing on diploids — in recent years , rates of toddlers and preschoolers hospitalized for opined overdoses more than doubled , according to a new EMOPOSITIVE . in EMOTRUST , overdoses rose more than 100 % over a 16 - year period among all children , the EMOPOSITIVE published in jams pediatrics oct. 31 showed . researchers from yale EMOTRUST of medicine analyzed national data from the kids ’ inpatient database on children admitted to u.s. hospitals for opined EMODISGUSTNEGATIVE . the EMOPOSITIVE focused on more than 13,000 records from patients ages 1 to 19 between 1997 to 2012 . what 's to EMOANGERDISGUSTNEGATIVE ? possibly the EMOPOSITIVE of prescribed EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS killers , EMOPOSITIVE oxycontin and vicodin . " " really ? try doped up EMONEGATIVE parents who EMONEGATIVESADNESSSURPRISE it EMOANGERDISGUSTNEGATIVE around in the first place . "
this is EMOANGERDISGUSTFEARNEGATIVE ! i wish that the international EMOPOSITIVE would step up and stop these atrocities from continuing to EMOANTICIPATION . but no one in the international EMOPOSITIVE seems to care . its so sad , it is like another rwanda is happening right in front of us but no one wants to spend the money to do anything about it because it is seen as just another third world EMONEGATIVESADNESS . things need to EMOFEAR before the international order is EMOPOSITIVE EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS about .
these migrant camps are getting more and more reminiscent of internment camps by the day . for a country that prides itself on being so EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST , i ca n't imagine how french citizens can accept the treatment of the camp 's children and others who remain behind in EMODISGUSTFEARNEGATIVE conditions . have a little EMOFEARPOSITIVE for your EMOPOSITIVETRUST human beings , please .
i do n't understand what i read here . the students were hijacking buses ? what the hell ? regardless , the local EMOFEARPOSITIVETRUST should not have turned them over to a drug EMONEGATIVE . i 'm sure they are probably dead by now , but i support the family finding out what happened and get EMOPOSITIVETRUST . they were kids , they did n't deserve to be killed for this .
my feelings and thoughts regarding the article i just read , is what i want to sit down and compose a brief message to you , in regards to it . i think that the greenhouse effect is highly over - rated . i find that the forces that EMONEGATIVE and are against it , has a strong point . as well , those in favor of it is also right , and just to want and EMOANTICIPATION and work towards ways that would be in the best EMOPOSITIVE of our lives and our environment . i believe it they would not EMOTRUST any EMOPOSITIVE , then whatever the harmful effects would only EMOPOSITIVE . those in EMOANGERNEGATIVE , who feel that it 's just an umbrella EMOPOSITIVETRUST to funnel monies in areas that are not needed . that believe mother nature and the natural state of how our earth and it 's environment works , are also somewhat correct . i wish each would meet EMONEGATIVE .
it 's upsetting that species are dying out , sometimes before we even know they exist . i wonder if there are ways we can use science to bring them back , if they even EMOPOSITIVE if we do . we need to take better care of the environment . it 's EMOANTICIPATIONFEARNEGATIVESADNESS that as these species EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS out , someday ours might as well .
those poor officers . like in any group of people , there are good and bad ones . in this society the tendency to demonize everyone for the actions of a few sets a very EMOFEARNEGATIVE precedent and things like this can EMOANTICIPATION . every person should be judged on their own merits . saying all cops are bad because of what a few have done is so EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVE and the EMOANTICIPATIONPOSITIVE EMOANGERDISGUSTNEGATIVE leads to things like this . i do n't know for sure what this person 's motivations were but there have been enough instances that some do n't see EMOTRUST EMONEGATIVE as people anymore and it makes their EMOPOSITIVE so much more EMOFEARNEGATIVE and we need good cops to do their jobs to keep us EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST .
hey EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST . did you hear about this EMODISGUSTNEGATIVE terrifying story of some british EMOTRUST who wanted seemed to want to EMONEGATIVE the american psycho movie ? he murdered two women and if not for them panicking , they would have been tortured . he was a EMODISGUSTNEGATIVESADNESS depraved individual . i do n't know how people like this live in our society . they are all EMONEGATIVE under the surface .
hey man can you believe that again the EMOPOSITIVE ice is at its EMONEGATIVESADNESS EMOPOSITIVETRUST again ! i just read an article on it and it seems like it keeps going EMONEGATIVESADNESS and EMONEGATIVESADNESS . i feel really EMONEGATIVESADNESS for animals that EMOANTICIPATIONTRUST on the EMOPOSITIVE ice , polar bears i think really need it . plus i read how it can have a really bad impact on our climate because the ice reflects so much of the sun 's energy without it even more heat from the sun gets in and does n't get reflected . definitely something to EMOANTICIPATIONFEAR and EMOANTICIPATIONFEARNEGATIVESADNESS about .
this was a EMONEGATIVESADNESS article to read because if you put yourself in that place , and you think of yourself EMOANGERNEGATIVESADNESS a EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST that is very close to you or a family EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST . i know that whenever i think about not having someone that has been close to me i wonder how i would feel or EMOANGERFEAR . i do n't think that we let people know how we feel enough .
this guy that i just read about seriously can not be trusted . he was going around acting like an apartment belonged to him when it did not in actuality . i wonder will he be punished sufficiently . i EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESSTRUST it . he will probable just EMOANGERNEGATIVE a deal and that will be the end of it . he needs to be publicly shamed .
did you see this article about the protest in mi ? it 's so EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS how divisive the country has become over the election and how EMOPOSITIVETRUST rump 's doing . what used to be considered rare and EMONEGATIVESADNESS seems now to become the norm , since all the EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS things EMOSURPRISE says and does . throwing a firecracker into a crowd ? who does that and thinks its EMOPOSITIVE ? people these days are getting very EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS .
you are not going to believe this article i just read about something EMOTRUST to torture , called conversion therapy . it 's something , designed by quacks , that is supposed to EMOPOSITIVE gay or queer people to heterosexual . are you kidding me ? people are who they are in life and are not to be changed , but embraced and EMOPOSITIVE . the regimen these poor people had to go through in this so called therapy was EMOANGERDISGUSTFEARNEGATIVE , and would not be used in north korea as a torture . it 's EMONEGATIVE what people do in the name of helping .
did you finally see what happened to that sicko that stole all of those nude photos from those celebrities ? those poor people got tricked into getting their photos EMOANGERNEGATIVE and this man went and was showing them to everyone . he finally was convicted of this and it serves him right . what an EMODISGUSTNEGATIVE . just remember you do n't ever take any photos like this and never upload them even if you did . keep this stuff private and off of the internet . i sure am EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVE this guy finally got what was EMOANTICIPATION to him .
i think there are way to many people watching cnn in this country . they need to EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST up . people are way to sensitive . we can not walk around on egg shells EMOANTICIPATIONFEARNEGATIVESADNESS about if we are going to EMOANGERDISGUSTNEGATIVE someone . people will say mean things . people will EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS your feelings . EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST up and get over it . do n't let it EMONEGATIVE you . these people do not EMOFEARTRUST your life . you do !
EMOPOSITIVETRUST videos can be EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST , but this seems rather silly to me . i would not consider applying make up on a train a EMONEGATIVE peeve and i 'm EMOSURPRISE it was on a list of complaints from other people . but we have to remember that this is a different EMOPOSITIVE as well so may be seen as something EMONEGATIVESADNESS in japan . i would EMOPOSITIVE on the issue of EMOJOYPOSITIVE that was mentioned in the article . it should n't be EMONEGATIVE , only informative .
wildfires in the western area of north carolina , in the appalachian mountains , can get so large they can be seen from space . in EMOTRUST , some of the wildfires in neighboring southern states can produce enough smoke to EMOTRUST areas of south carolina . despite not actually having a EMOFEAR there , the smoke can get so thick that it takes heavy rain to make it dissipate .
i really did n't realize how quickly climate EMOFEAR could have an effect on certain areas of the world . i do believe that climate EMOFEAR is being caused by humans to a good extent , but i 'm not sure if EMONEGATIVESADNESS impacts will come as quickly as some people speculate . it 's very EMOPOSITIVE but i am EMOFEARSADNESS for the safety of some people if things EMOANTICIPATIONPOSITIVETRUST this way .
" hey , remember that eighties song " " you spin me right round " " that people like to EMOJOYPOSITIVESURPRISE about ? the guy EMOPOSITIVETRUST for that just dies recently , he seemed like he was EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST EMOPOSITIVE . i heard that he was on the uk version of celebrity big EMOPOSITIVETRUST , but i bet that EMOTRUST is just as EMONEGATIVE as the american version . it 's so EMOPOSITIVE how the celebrity EMOPOSITIVE over there compares to over here .

wow , i just read an article that says coconuts could be in EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS of becoming much more EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS . there is a EMODISGUSTFEARNEGATIVESADNESS going around that causes EMODISGUSTFEARNEGATIVESADNESS yellowing and wipes them out . due to the water concentration , a EMOPOSITIVE seed EMOTRUST is not an EMOPOSITIVE . you would have to have a living gene EMOTRUST . that would affect a lot of companies and industries .
another taliban EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVE in afghanistan today , this EMOANTICIPATION directed against the germans . a few dead and many wounded , primarily women and children . they said it was in EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVE against us air strikes that have cause a lot of civilian casualties . an endless cycle , just like before . remind me again why we 're there .
i just read an article on how many civilians are killed by airstrikes by nato forces . this is a EMOPOSITIVE issue because the mainstream media never report these stories . the media only paints nato as the good guys and never in a bad light . they can commit acts that can be deemed a EMOFEARNEGATIVE EMOANGERNEGATIVE but as EMOANTICIPATION as they are the EMOPOSITIVETRUST they do not need to be accounted for .
the story about what is going on currently in venezuela is devastating . it is almost haunting and definitely disturbing . the economic EMONEGATIVE that is happening there is not only affecting people , but also the animals that live there . especially in the zoos . we do n't often let how a EMONEGATIVE in countries can affect animals EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS our minds , we typically only think of the people . not only is directly affecting the animals in the way that they are being fed diets that are drastically different from they should be consuming , but the people there are having to hunt animals that we would not typically deem EMOPOSITIVE . such as cats , and dogs , and even going as far as to EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS horses from racetracks simply to EMOPOSITIVE them , or to feed them to animals at the local zoos . many animals have suffered for weeks .
hey , zambia is EMOPOSITIVETRUST elephants on a massive refuge type area ! they are EMOANGERNEGATIVE off poaching and that sort of stuff . which is great ! but i had no idea that the elephants are EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS a lot around the . they have even killed people ! sad huh ? also elephants will wipe out a farmers entire plants and EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST ! that is really bad . they feel like their EMOFEARNEGATIVE care more about the animals than the people ! i think they should EMOPOSITIVETRUST some fencing . that is EMOANGERDISGUSTNEGATIVE to let people EMONEGATIVE all because they wo n't put up some barriers to block the elephants .
it 's too bad that we are still in the middle east . i wish EMOSURPRISE would just EMOPOSITIVE out of the middle east entirely so our soldiers will stop being targets for all the countries that hate us . the longer we are there the easier we make it for them to EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS EMOANGERDISGUSTNEGATIVESADNESS to our troops . it must not be easy for them to be there away from their families .
robert vaughn passed away but i do n't really have anything to say about him . people EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS every day and he was in his 80s . he was in some EMOPOSITIVE movies and seemed dot have lived a EMOPOSITIVE and EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST life . he was n't in anything i have ever seen and i never heard few him before . maybe ill check out his movies someday since he was EMOPOSITIVE .
i hate the EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS that is happening here . i feel for the three soldiers that died and their families . i EMOSURPRISE i 'm too much of a pacifist but i really wish that people could realize that this EMOPOSITIVETRUST of EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS is a EMODISGUSTNEGATIVE of EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST and lives . however , i also know that this is n't how the world works .
i am EMOJOYPOSITIVE that there are people who care about this issue , but i really do n't . i feel like this is just part of the life - cycle and i do n't really get why so much money is being EMOANGERDISGUSTNEGATIVE on a EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS and is n't necessarily EMOPOSITIVETRUST . however , as i said , it 's probably good that people who know more about this issue than i do are caring about the EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS .
i have a EMOPOSITIVETRUST hard EMOANTICIPATION with this article . my husband is a us army soldier that fought to take over mosul the first EMOANTICIPATION at the cost of many lives . and through EMOANGERNEGATIVESADNESS measures in our EMOFEARNEGATIVE and EMOFEAR , we let go of mosul and are again trying to figure out a way to take it back . it makes me sad that there are people being oppressed in the world but it is also clear to me that at what cost do we EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVE the oppressors and EMOPOSITIVE a whose side to be on . maybe we should EMOANTICIPATIONFEARNEGATIVESADNESS about ourselves stateside and stay out of the EMODISGUSTNEGATIVE in the middle east .
i 've seen the lager video , he needs to be in EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS . as far as tensing goes , that 's a EMONEGATIVESADNESS call . EMOANGERPOSITIVETRUST of the story is , do n't give a man with a EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVE any EMOPOSITIVE to be EMOFEARNEGATIVE of you . the traffic stop went the direction it did because of du bose 's actions . i have a hard EMOANTICIPATION feeling EMOPOSITIVESADNESS for someone who makes EMOANGERDISGUSTFEARNEGATIVE decisions that EMOANTICIPATION in predictable outcomes .
oh my god . did you hear about this story of this family of two girls that got killed on halloween ? apparently they were EMOANGERNEGATIVE in a trailer and that cause them to EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS . could you imagine just EMONEGATIVESADNESS to go out and have EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVE while EMONEGATIVESURPRISE and treating but then you get the sad news that you daughters are dead ? this is heartbreaking for that family .
can you believe this article ? the more i read this article the more disgusted i got with what had been done to this EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST . this is a awful story that deserves to be heard by more people to make sure that the the EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST receives EMOPOSITIVETRUST , and that the person who did this is not allowed to EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS any more animals . i think it is a great thing that this person is not allowing for someone to get away with this and making sure that others will stand with him and not allow this EMOANGERNEGATIVE to go unpunished . i think it would be great if you could EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST this story and let others know so something like this can be stopped in the future .
sleep is very EMOPOSITIVETRUST , and i ’m quite sure you know that already . however , some aspects of life – like habits , even smartphone , and EMONEGATIVE in work – affect our sleep cycles . a cdc - backed EMOPOSITIVE published in february of this year has EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST that about a third of americans earn’t getting enough sleep . multiple factors affect the country ’s snooze patterns , and one of which is EMOPOSITIVETRUST . many people , researchers at the cdc say , are not prioritizing sleep . so how can you EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVE yourself to go early in bed ? well , this new research that we ’ll discuss might EMOANTICIPATIONPOSITIVETRUST you to review your priorities and put sleep above many , because you still can .
this is such a non - story . every day people are dealing with divorce and EMOTRUST issues . this unfortunately has become a common EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS . generally speaking a story like this is sad to read or hear about but these are celebrities . who cares about their problems ? they are no more EMOJOYPOSITIVE than anyone else . people who get caught up in celebrity EMOTRUST battles need to get a life .
this was a terrible EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS gone EMONEGATIVE , and honestly i do n't really know if there was something that could be done about this before the event even happened ? how did this man get into the EMOANTICIPATION with a EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVE ? was it because he did not pass through security before EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVE this man or because he chose not to ? i do n't think something like this should have happens and being an EMOANTICIPATION i definitely do n't think this should have happened at all assuming all the security that they do have in place how was this to EMOANTICIPATION ?
i read this article about what EMONEGATIVESADNESS people think . it is EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS that they still believe they are being targeted by the EMOFEARPOSITIVETRUST . can you believe in this day and age they still believe that . the difference between why more EMONEGATIVESADNESS people get shot is more of them do crimes . add to the EMOTRUST that EMONEGATIVESADNESS families tell their kids not to EMOTRUST the EMOFEARPOSITIVETRUST . do n't run , do n't EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVE back and do what the EMOFEARPOSITIVETRUST EMOPOSITIVETRUST says and you have a lot great EMOSURPRISE of not getting shot . i ca n't stand these EMONEGATIVESADNESS people who feel like they have it so bad here . let them try living back in africa and see how they like that .
an article talking about increasing the deportations of haitians is one that i feel for those involved . haiti has been brutalized by mother nature , and the clinton , and people are trying to get somewhere to EMOPOSITIVE while the country recovers . the u.s. let 's them in to EMOANTICIPATION them back out and that is a bit EMOANGERDISGUSTNEGATIVE . it 's not a situation where those from mexico just EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESURPRISE over and EMOFEAR from society . these people need help but it does n't EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESURPRISE me that the u.s. would do this in a EMOANTICIPATION of need . EMOPOSITIVESADNESS felt but EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS to do anything about it .
i ca n't believe people spend their money doing that EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST of parties . i think its not correct to be extremist in how much we support a EMOPOSITIVETRUST . EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST supremacists are EMOFEARNEGATIVE people with EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS ideology . they promote EMOANGERDISGUSTFEARNEGATIVE values to their sons and to the society , they are not EMOPOSITIVETRUST with other races and that EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS the society , specially here in EMOPOSITIVETRUST states that is a mulch - cultural country . this groups should EMOFEAR from the map as soon as possible ! their ideology is EMONEGATIVE in a country like this .
for all the married couples out there , please think twice before you EMOANGERDISGUSTNEGATIVE on your beloved EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST . is it really EMOPOSITIVE to throw away years of experiences down the drain just to have EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVE with a random EMOFEARNEGATIVE for a night ? these celebrity scandals are such a EMONEGATIVE , all the times i look on the news and these relationships barely last .
being interested in sports and health together , this is a EMOPOSITIVE article showing the impact eye injuries have on different types of sports . it 's somewhat common to see these injuries present themselves in EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVE , baseball , and sports without EMOPOSITIVE EMOPOSITIVE . that 's just the nature of sports where consequences EMOANTICIPATION .
" i just read an article blaming donald EMOSURPRISE and his campaign for hate crimes against muslims EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVE . it was your typical EMONEGATIVE that the media pushes on you - you know , EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVE mongering mixed with unsubstantiated EMONEGATIVE . it mentioned the supposed " " muslim EMONEGATIVE " " that EMOSURPRISE was EMOPOSITIVETRUST for . at that point , i EMONEGATIVESADNESS EMOPOSITIVE in the article as it was 100 % clear what the agenda was . "
" did you hear about the taliban EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVE on the german consulate in afghanistan ? if not , they set off a bomb at the gates and then an EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVE ensued . about 130 people were EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS with 6 or so dead . will that EMOFEARNEGATIVE ever end ? an EMONEGATIVE saying says that " " all empires end in that area " " going back to alexander the great . the country has never known EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST and it 's not looking any better . i feel sorry for all the EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS , especially the children . i 'm not sure the un is making things any better either ... "
i remember this going on . i knew someone who considered this EMOPOSITIVE . it 's a EMODISGUSTFEARNEGATIVESADNESS that women have to think like this , about birth control meant to outlast a political regime . EMOSURPRISE and pence are reprehensible , but at least it has n't come to pass - not that they would n't salivate at the EMOANTICIPATIONPOSITIVE to EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVE EMOANTICIPATIONFEARNEGATIVE 's health like this , we 've just been EMOJOYPOSITIVESURPRISE so far that they have n't got their way . it bothers me how these guys think .
its sad that now and moving EMOPOSITIVE in my lifetime we will see many EMOSADNESS actors and actresses EMONEGATIVE to death in its many forms . it makes me feel for those people and EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVE a EMOPOSITIVE of EMOANTICIPATION in a view that is not endless . i can put myself in the shoes of someone EMOSADNESS and battling health problems and it saddens me to do so .
it 's about EMOANTICIPATION somebody stood up to mexico . we are being flooded with mexicans and immigrants flooding over the border . it 's an EMOANGERNEGATIVE as far as i 'm EMOFEARSADNESS . i could go into detail about all the negatives it causes . but what i am EMODISGUSTNEGATIVESADNESS of is every EMOANTICIPATION we want to do something about it , all the naysayers and doomsayers through nafta and EMOTRUST and economics in our face . i get it we made some EMONEGATIVE deals in the past that have EMOPOSITIVE to bad consequences , but we elected EMOSURPRISE to take a new direction . mexico will have to get their act together too , i 'm EMODISGUSTNEGATIVESADNESS of them acting like saints every EMOANTICIPATION we want to take an EMOPOSITIVE .
i ca n't even imagine what it would be like to be minding our own business in a club and then having someone come in and EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVE you . this must have been terrifying for this person . i certainly hope they did not lose their life and i also hope this is not an EMOSURPRISE that leads to further problems in the future .
leonard cohen just died . knew little about him but now see ill have to look into his songs and writing . he was the EMOPOSITIVE of the EMONEGATIVE EMOPOSITIVE , it seems . his EMOPOSITIVE continued to EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST as he aged , and he was able to reap some rewards , but it did n't really EMOSURPRISE up with his needs until recent years . he was a buddhist EMOPOSITIVETRUST , too . had no idea . he clearly raised the bar in song writing .
hello , i have just read this article and have to say that it was a very good and EMOPOSITIVE read . it is about the chartered EMOTRUST of environmental health and they discuss how smoking should be banned in all parks , zoos , and playgrounds to reduce the chances of children growing up thinking that using cigarettes is normal . i can see why some might say that this is the last step before decriminalization of the product and consumer .
" i do n't know what more it 's gon na take for meat eaters to finally get it through their heads that we consume way too much meat . if someone says " " plant based " " anywhere near them they seem to automatically EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS it . EMOPOSITIVE is the EMOPOSITIVE EMOPOSITIVETRUST to the EMOANGERNEGATIVE of the earth . it 's not like people are preaching everyone go vegan , but drastically reducing your intake of meat would help the planet by a huge EMONEGATIVESADNESS . for whatever EMOPOSITIVE , they just ca n't seem to rationalize that simple sentiment . "
it is disturbing that one person ’s views ( such as EMOPOSITIVETRUST of the usa ) can be so disruptive to people ’s lives . the situation with the immigrants from mexico and the idea of EMOPOSITIVE a southern border wall is upsetting to me . EMOPOSITIVETRUST EMOSURPRISE EMOTRUST and views are disruptive to the whole EMOTRUST of mexico , causes political EMOANGER and EMODISGUSTFEARNEGATIVE , not to mention the extreme uncertainty in the lives of mexican immigrants in usa , who already have hard lives here .
i have no idea what any of that means but i wonder sometimes what it would be like to play a game that goes on over more than one day . imagine if you could go back home and go to sleep at halftime of the super bowl and then come back the next day and play the second half . maybe then the falcons would have taken the 2nd half of that game against the patriots more seriously . when i watched lebanon crush the EMOFEARNEGATIVE i was EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST of curious as to how they slept EMOPOSITIVE a game was EMOANTICIPATION up . they probably felt scared , like they had a big test EMOANTICIPATION up and they did n't think they were EMOANTICIPATIONPOSITIVETRUST .
thinking of the earthquakes , makes me think of the issue on global warming and climate EMOFEAR . it seems like we are having more and more natural disasters . this leads you to think of the cause and how climate EMOFEAR had to be happening . i could not imagine . shows you to be EMOPOSITIVE , you never know what could EMOANTICIPATION . something are just out of your control .
we need to be more EMOPOSITIVETRUST with our EMOANTICIPATIONFEARSADNESS areas ! it is EMOFEARNEGATIVESURPRISE that no one wants to EMOPOSITIVE about how these areas are being EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS by development and can never be returned to their original EMOANTICIPATIONFEARSADNESS states . can you imagine a world in which our children can never go camping or hiking in the EMOANTICIPATIONFEARSADNESS because it has all been EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS and turned into buildings ? ?
you know i have no EMOPOSITIVESADNESS for anyone who harms an animal . i 'm a huge animal rights EMOTRUST and i think those who are cruel to animals deserve very strict EMOANGERDISGUSTFEARNEGATIVE . the EMOPOSITIVETRUST involved should be charged with a EMOANGERNEGATIVE and fired from their EMOPOSITIVE . i hate it when people EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS animals and this particular EMOANGERNEGATIVE did not have to EMOANTICIPATION ! when this happens with children being left in EMOANGER cars , there are serious charges leveled and so , there should be the same in this EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS !
it brings me great EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS to tell you about a horrific EMOSURPRISE that left two children without parents after a mechanical EMODISGUSTFEARNEGATIVESADNESS at an EMOJOYPOSITIVE park . it is truly shocking and disturbing that this could have happened . thee two kids slot both parents and they watched them EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS which is disturbing to think about .
i think that people try to pin a lot of stuff on EMOSURPRISE as far as sexism goes , but it does n't really matter . if people want EMOSURPRISE out of office then they need to find something else to pin on him . he tampered with the election via the russians , and thatch what people need to pin on him . this sexism EMONEGATIVE is n't going to go anywhere
a reward of $ 25000 is being offered to EMOSURPRISE somebody who is EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS horses in the salt river area . there are several murders of horses every year . anyways , the group raising the money started a campaign on groundsmen , and people have donated $ 25000 . the group also is EMOFEARSADNESS with EMOANTICIPATIONPOSITIVETRUST - EMOTRUST issues .
i ca n't begin to imagine going through that night . the recollection from the survivor is EMODISGUSTFEARNEGATIVESADNESS . i can not fathom the thoughts and emotions of those who were there trapped for hours . the EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS of so many makes it easier to become desensitized to it , but EMOFEARNEGATIVE the individual stories makes it so EMOPOSITIVETRUST and sad .
really ? how are these people allowed to have children ? its really not that hard to not poison your EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVE is it ? i mean it should n't be , but maybe these people are high on their own drugs so they do n't notice their kids are getting into them . its really sad and something should certainly be done .
another EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS of EMOFEARNEGATIVE not EMOPOSITIVE like it should . one should have EMOPOSITIVETRUST recourse without having to EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST an EMOANGERFEARPOSITIVETRUST and spend thousands of dollars to straighten things out . it makes me EMOANGERDISGUSTNEGATIVE because i know how easily it could EMOANTICIPATION to me . why people ca n't do their jobs and/or EMOTRUST some EMOPOSITIVE in this situation is beyond my comprehension . i sure hope this does not EMOANTICIPATION to me or you .
it 's always a bad thing when the murder rate increases . the EMOTRUST that it had the highest EMOPOSITIVE in decades is incredibly disturbing , although it 's EMOPOSITIVETRUST to remember that the overall rate is still much EMONEGATIVESADNESS than it has been in the past . people think that things are more EMOFEARNEGATIVE than ever today , but the EMOPOSITIVETRUST EMOTRUST that 's not EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST .
i ca n't really believe he was EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST dead in lo ' stromboli 's condo . he was n't anywhere near old enough to EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS of natural causes so it should be at least a little EMOSURPRISE when we hear about what the cause of death was . i am intrigued to find out if we have another hollywood murder on our hands . you just ca n't tell anymore these days . you never know who , you never know when .
people who take EMOPOSITIVE of and EMOANTICIPATIONFEARNEGATIVE animals are the worst criminals in EMOPOSITIVE . animals are EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS and EMONEGATIVESADNESS to do anything other than be confined and taken EMOPOSITIVE of . this article shows the EMONEGATIVESADNESS process after animals are confiscated and taken away from these EMOFEARNEGATIVE people , but there is no global consensus on the EMOPOSITIVE sequence and handling of these animals .
hey ax , i EMOANTICIPATION this was a EMOPOSITIVE article that you might be interested in EMOPOSITIVE . it definitely piqued my EMOPOSITIVE . i EMOANTICIPATION it relates to your situation that you are dealing with at the moment . let me know what you think of the video as well . i might EMOTRUST this to jackie too and see if what she thinks of it .
i feel like a lot of artists do this or try to do this . take EMOPOSITIVETRUST for EMOJOYPOSITIVESADNESS or lyrics that others have helped with . this probably happened more then we know about . they just made an entire disney movie on it . coco . it basically was about 2 singers and the one killed the other so no one would know he made and wrote all the lyrics and EMOJOYPOSITIVESADNESS that the one guy stole . i mean any way you look at it it 's not right . the guy does EMONEGATIVETRUST and EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST out and then some for what he has done to his EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST .
what are we going to do , EMOANTICIPATION collecting cow farts ? that sounds like a good EMOPOSITIVE to me . i bet the benefits are good . i EMOSURPRISE the liberals will try to EMOANGERDISGUSTNEGATIVE meat eaters for this some how . i mean , maybe we can EMOANTICIPATIONPOSITIVE some EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST of methane collection EMOTRUST and then use the cow farts to power the world . EMOPOSITIVE about renewable energy !
i 'm not a fan of muslim migrants myself . i find most of arab EMOPOSITIVE EMODISGUSTNEGATIVE and antithetical to american values . this is EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST fucked up , though . this article feels like something out of the 1960s . makes you consider the cyclical and incremental nature of human history . despite our technological advances we EMONEGATIVESADNESS EMOFEARNEGATIVE to the same prejudices and biases again and again . before we were burning native americans , then the irish , then blacks , and now muslims . human EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVE at work .
this type of thing is always largely ignored as it goes on , when people could have known about it but chose not to . then many years later the EMOPOSITIVETRUST comes out and some people address it with EMONEGATIVESADNESS , and others still EMOANTICIPATIONPOSITIVETRUST to EMONEGATIVE it . the way for EMOPOSITIVETRUST EMOFEAR to come is with EMOPOSITIVETRUST . any crimes that are n't EMOTRUST by a EMOPOSITIVE of limitations need to be addressed through EMODISGUSTNEGATIVE , and they need to look for ways to EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS instead of looking for ways not to . they should also EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST EMOPOSITIVE suits , but those are always against the departments and not the individuals . there needs to be EMOPOSITIVE so that the officers are the ones that are held EMOPOSITIVETRUST instead of the taxpayers continually having to make payouts because the EMOFEARPOSITIVETRUST EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS the EMOTRUST .
i just read an article about EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS , it was really sad . it started off talking about a 12 year old girl who was interested in EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS groups online . one day she went to EMOTRUST , or so her mother EMOANTICIPATION . the mother EMOPOSITIVE a phone call from the channel a&e notifying her that her EMOJOYPOSITIVE had took her own life . the article went on to say how russia was third in the world in suicides . it was a really sad article .
talking about donald EMOSURPRISE is so EMODISGUSTNEGATIVESADNESS at this point . i wish that article had a little more about climate EMOFEAR in it , which seems to be the current biggest EMOPOSITIVE EMONEGATIVE of his presidency , but for some EMOPOSITIVE ( horrifyingly ) that topic divides people . i want to hear from people who have voted for him and who 's minds have changed .
i think the wraparound glasses are a great idea . i do n't care how EMOANGERDISGUSTNEGATIVE they look . if i had to choose whether or not my kid was EMONEGATIVESADNESS about fashion or EMOPOSITIVETRUST his eyes , eye protection would win every EMOANTICIPATION . ugh , can you imagine the EMOANTICIPATION of EMOANGERNEGATIVESADNESS your eyesight , or possibly even the whole eye , just because you did n't want to look silly ? nope , wraparound glasses all the way !
this is just EMOANGERDISGUSTFEARNEGATIVE . i can not believe that this is happening to people . why are people EMOFEARNEGATIVE to go to the EMOPOSITIVETRUST ? there is no EMOPOSITIVE for this . i am EMONEGATIVE to all this EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVE and i can not believe i am writing about a man 's penis right now . i can not find any EMONEGATIVE for this and people need to be EMOPOSITIVE about the health care EMOTRUST so they are not so EMOFEARNEGATIVE of it .
i thank god because my sisters were born in usa instead of those countries in the middle east who still believe in male EMOPOSITIVETRUST . can you imagine a woman seeking EMOPOSITIVE fro a male figure who is a EMOTRUST and sometimes a son to EMOPOSITIVE a passport?that is so bad . i hope the activists will succeed in helping this women because this is so EMOSURPRISE .
you can never really EMOTRUST a person . someone can end up dead and those who are left in the wake are the ones that EMONEGATIVE . really makes you think just how short of a life we have in comparison . but having no EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST can do something to a person . it is one of those things that we have a bond between a person and if something in a relationship is not EMOPOSITIVE it can drive a person to do something they would normally not do .
hello EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST . how are you ? how is your family ? we had some EMOANTICIPATION without EMOPOSITIVE , we should EMOFEARNEGATIVE that and always EMOPOSITIVETRUST . of sure where you live this that i am going to say to you is already news but , EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST , you must take care of you and your family please . i do not know if you EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST out but i read in a digital online newspaper samples of EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS in philadelphia , i could not get out of my head that you live in that place . apparently a person who was EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVEPOSITIVE shot in the EMODISGUST to an elderly man and another person who was accompanying him . one of the reports i 've heard from the EMOFEARPOSITIVETRUST is that the EMOANGERNEGATIVE weapon has not been EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST , which makes me suppose that until now the EMOFEARPOSITIVETRUST have no idea who was , and neither the clues to EMOSURPRISE the bad guy . the EMOFEARPOSITIVETRUST do not know anything so it means t
hey EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST . i think this article made me EMONEGATIVESADNESS about this erika situation . it is spreading with such EMOPOSITIVE like never before and it kills very fast . i think the whole world needs to be on alert and health scientists need to be EMOPOSITIVE hard to try and EMOANGERNEGATIVE this disease . it 's gon na take some EMOANTICIPATION but something needs to be done
the article was quite eye opening for someone who may not be extremely into EMOANGER . the EMOPOSITIVETRUST flag seems to somehow have different meanings to different people , which i never really understood . to get EMOANGERNEGATIVESADNESS because the flag was being hung in college campuses , makes EMOPOSITIVE to me . i would get EMOANGERNEGATIVESADNESS as well . for students to be EMOFEARNEGATIVE for their welfare and or they education at their college because of EMOPOSITIVETRUST EMOPOSITIVETRUST EMOSURPRISE , also makes EMOPOSITIVE to me . the whole campaign seems to be one big EMONEGATIVE .
i felt very bad when read these kinds of news . for me , it is EMOPOSITIVE to EMOPOSITIVE women and kids . i think they are vulnerable than men . the society should give more EMOPOSITIVE to them . i really feel EMOSADNESS for the girls who had EMODISGUSTFEARNEGATIVESADNESS like that . i hate those bad people that did all these crimes . they should be punished .
ugh , i just read an article about our EMOANGERDISGUSTFEARNEGATIVE EMOPOSITIVETRUST and the way women are reacting to these rumors , allegations and truths made about this man and his EMOANGERDISGUSTNEGATIVESADNESS treatment of women in the past . and , that 's just it , who is EMONEGATIVE enough to think his behavior is only in the past and is not still occurring today behind closed doors ! ? i am sure it is only a matter of EMOANTICIPATION before that also comes out . the more and more i read about him , the more and more EMOANGERNEGATIVESADNESS i am to have him as a EMOPOSITIVETRUST and wish i did not live in a country where that animal is calling the shots . the article was talking about women , especially republican women , starting to EMOPOSITIVE away from their EMOPOSITIVE and EMOANGERNEGATIVESADNESS their warm and fuzzy feelings towards EMOSURPRISE . about EMOANTICIPATION !
i read an article about making the ivory EMOTRUST EMOPOSITIVETRUST , and it said it could cause the extinction of elephants . i find it extremely disturbing , since i ca n't imagine elephants being EMONEGATIVESADNESS . it makes me really EMOANGERDISGUSTNEGATIVE that poachers are able to EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS so many elephants , and that even if it 's EMOPOSITIVETRUST to EMOTRUST ivory , the EMOANGERNEGATIVE is still really high . i think finding a substitute for ivory is a better EMOPOSITIVE . no one actually needs ivory , and keeping it illegal seems like a better idea .
hi there . i just read an article and i feel like i need to EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST my thoughts on it . it was about an oil spill ! ! oil spills are so upsetting . i feel so sorry for all the ocean life and animals that are affected and will be affected ! it 's so EMONEGATIVE . i wish we could EMOFEAR these from ever happening again .
although i do think that companies have the right to advertise their product EMOPOSITIVE , i also think that targeting kids is EMONEGATIVE . i think that good health should come first and the advertisement should EMOPOSITIVE this . advertisements should not target kids , given that they do n't really know what is good for them yet .
a EMODISGUSTFEARNEGATIVESADNESS called microscopically has spread from south america to america . it 's a EMONEGATIVE which causes severe brain EMONEGATIVE . in the article , a couple 's EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVE has the disease and showed signs of EMONEGATIVE early on . they were EMONEGATIVESADNESS whether a second EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVE would also have the disease but the EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVE did not even though the odds were one in four .
wow .. you have to check this out . there was a EMOANGERDISGUSTFEARNEGATIVE EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESSSURPRISE on a family type water ride in EMOPOSITIVE EMOPOSITIVE australia . 4 people were killed .. 2 women ages 42 and 32 i think , also two men , 38 , and 35 , . this is what happened ... 2 people were ejected from the raft and the other 2 were trapped inside .. they all died . the park was shut down . the thing that makes it EMODISGUSTNEGATIVE is that the water EMOPOSITIVE is like a tame family type ride .. definitely things families would go on together . makes you think right ?
i am a little bit on the fences about how to approach immigration and the mexican border EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS . this article talks about different issues EMOPOSITIVETRUST EMOSURPRISE has had his hands in on and how some problems are arising . i think the countries need to stand alone and work on their own issues so they have home EMOPOSITIVE EMOPOSITIVETRUST . seems like a lot of compromising is not taking place .
this is EMOANGERDISGUSTFEARNEGATIVE . too have a disaster like this EMOANTICIPATION is sad . other nations should do what we can in order to help . you never know when we may need the help for other countries . we know as a country how hard it is to EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS everything to a natural disaster . all the lives EMONEGATIVESADNESS it is best EMOPOSITIVE to help out .
the EMOFEARNEGATIVE that involved india and pakistan is terrible . there are so many EMOPOSITIVETRUST civilian me were killed . the world needs EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST and it is hard to imagine that a lot of people in 21st EMOPOSITIVETRUST are still EMODISGUSTFEARNEGATIVESADNESS from wars . we should really cherish that we live in the us and far from what happened there .
" i feel bad for the victims of this murderer , they did nothing EMONEGATIVE to be attacked during their everyday life , they were EMOPOSITIVETRUST . i 'm extremely EMOANGERDISGUSTNEGATIVE with the no nazi murderer , he was an egoist and i 'm mad with the EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVE control laws that allow people with " " metal health problems " " to easily purchase guns . "
" as if our immigration EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS could n't get any EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS ! now haitian immigrants are going through mexico to EMOTRUST up at the cali border ! i hope they all get deported . immigrants are nothing but a EMODISGUSTFEARNEGATIVESADNESS on this country , for the most part , EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST the EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST ones we get from areas of asia . the haitians would do nothing to stimulate our EMOTRUST , would all end up on EMOANTICIPATIONPOSITIVE EMOPOSITIVE , and would cost taxpayers like you and me ! we really ca n't EMOPOSITIVE to keep letting them stream into the country , but the good news is that most of them are being booted . we just need to EMOFEAR " " most " " to " " all " " because there is nothing good that can come of letting them in the country ! ! "
crushed to death by a EMOTRUST that makes recycled plastics into pellets ? really ? what a terrible way to EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS . my EMOSURPRISE is that standard operating EMOFEARPOSITIVE does not EMOPOSITIVE crawling inside the EMOTRUST to unclog it . i understand that it is a EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS , but gee , at some point people have to be held EMOPOSITIVETRUST for their own actions . i 'm sure there will be a lawsuit , probably a hefty one , but i hope they lose . there does n't seem to be any EMOPOSITIVE the company should be held EMOPOSITIVETRUST for his actions unless there was a malfunction of the overall systems . i 'm trying not to picture it in my mind . yikes !
there was this EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS story in the news the other day . two guys were shot in pennsylvania . one was shot twice in the EMODISGUST and the other was shot in the back . there were no arrests or anything and there was not stated EMOPOSITIVE . i wonder if it was a random thing or if they were involved with drugs or something ? i EMOSURPRISE we 'll never know ...
seriously , what 's EMONEGATIVE with this guy ! who throws an animal to the EMOTRUST for no EMOPOSITIVE . what a EMOANGERSURPRISE . i hope the judge throws the book at him . he does n't necessarily deserve EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS EMOANTICIPATION , but i 'm thinking a hefty fine as well as many hours of EMOPOSITIVE service . EMOPOSITIVE world should file a restraining order from this guy as well .
" i had to read another article with zero formatting for a survey . this one was about EMOFEARNEGATIVE in the middle east . it was EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST EMODISGUSTNEGATIVESADNESS to read . EMOTRUST makes people do such EMOANGERDISGUSTFEARNEGATIVE , hateful , EMONEGATIVE things . apparently kids just EMOPOSITIVE up explosives , people get their heads blown off , little girls EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS for no EMOPOSITIVE . for what ? because someone 's imaginary EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST in the EMOPOSITIVE is slightly different from their imaginary EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST in the EMOPOSITIVE ? EMOANGERDISGUSTNEGATIVE , EMOANGERDISGUSTFEARNEGATIVE . imagine what these people could have EMOJOYPOSITIVE if they dedicated themselves to EMOPOSITIVE instead . we could be on other planets , we could live for thousands of years or more . but nope , we 'd rather hate and murder each other of something as EMONEGATIVE as " " god " " or " " allah . " " "
" michael moore did it again ! the man might not be much to look at , but he continually nails liberals social values with an EMOPOSITIVETRUST fist . this EMOANTICIPATION it was him predicting EMOSURPRISE 's EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST in a film , but what next ? he is serving as a light post for liberals , trying to wake them up that aspects of the democratic party are out of tune with the EMOPOSITIVE american people , but will they listen ? EMOSURPRISE won for many reasons , and while he encourages liberals to tell their conservative friends hillary " " won the popular vote , " " what good will that even do ? the EMOANTICIPATION for liberals to get better in - tune with the needs of the EMOPOSITIVE american conservative EMOANTICIPATIONPOSITIVE has EMOANTICIPATION since passed ... "
situations like this make you feel so EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS . i mean it 's utterly awful but there 's nothing you can do about it . EMOPOSITIVE about it just feels like needlessly troubling yourself . there 's a feeling of EMODISGUSTNEGATIVESADNESS too because the whole situation was brought about by the us invading their country and we would 've prevented that .
of the 5000 rhinoceroses that remain free in the world have just killed one more . poachers do not EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST EMOFEARNEGATIVE species . this enrages me and i try to hunt them . the 18 - year - old rhinoceros left her EMOJOYPOSITIVE orphaned . i really hope that stronger measures will be taken for the protection of these species and that their extinction will be avoided .
i think the situation in aleppo is really dire . i do n't understand why the syrian EMOFEARNEGATIVE is trying to EMOFEARNEGATIVE the people there whey they did n't do anything EMONEGATIVE . i think the whole situation is really sad and that a lot of EMOPOSITIVETRUST people are getting EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS for no EMOPOSITIVE . EMOFEARNEGATIVE is awful and i hope that there 's a EMOPOSITIVE to it soon . i 'm EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVE that the un is trying to do something , but i just do n't think that it 's enough .
EMOANGERDISGUSTNEGATIVE happens . people EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS for no EMOPOSITIVETRUST EMOPOSITIVE all the EMOANTICIPATION . it ’s EMONEGATIVESADNESS for these people , but they ’re not alone or EMOJOYPOSITIVE in their EMONEGATIVESADNESS . maybe if the ride was EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST to be mechanically EMODISGUSTNEGATIVE they can EMOANGERNEGATIVESADNESS and gets some money . otherwise it ’s just another sad story out of so many others like it in the world .
i saw a EMOANGERDISGUSTFEARNEGATIVE story about a turtle on line today . a man took a hammer and beat a large turtle to death . he EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS the shell on it 's back and crushed it 's head with the hammer . i hope they give that vile EMONEGATIVE for a human being the EMOPOSITIVE sentence . i EMOJOYPOSITIVE turtles . they are so EMOPOSITIVESURPRISE and EMOPOSITIVE to EMOANTICIPATIONFEAR . i have a creek in my back yard and i see them all the EMOANTICIPATION and they do not EMONEGATIVE . i ca n't stand animal abuse . it makes me EMODISGUSTNEGATIVESADNESS .
while EMOPOSITIVE this , i ca n't help but think about how much of EMOANGER nowadays is about money . how many millions of dollars is EMONEGATIVE trying to EMOANTICIPATIONPOSITIVETRUST people that someone is a good person and right for the EMOPOSITIVE . it should be like any other position . work hard . do good . EMOPOSITIVE a resume you can be EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST of and let that speak for itself !
this poor family EMONEGATIVESADNESS the EMOTRUST just a short EMOANTICIPATION ago ! now she is EMODISGUSTNEGATIVESADNESS and EMODISGUSTFEARNEGATIVESADNESS . please keep this family in your thoughts and prayers in the next few days as they treat her . i hope her family is able to be there with her during this hard EMOANTICIPATION , and that they are able to help her in her EMOPOSITIVE .
did you hear about this sexual harassment EMOFEARNEGATIVE involving the national parks service ? i EMOSURPRISE there really is no industry that is immune to this EMOANGERDISGUSTNEGATIVESURPRISE . incidents have been documenting going back decades but nothing was done about it . it 's really EMOSURPRISE what people in power can get away with .
" these pellet guns almost seem like they were meant to maim individuals , under the EMONEGATIVE of a less - EMODISGUSTFEARNEGATIVESADNESS round . the EMOTRUST that the ammunition seems to have been modified to cause more EMOANGERDISGUSTNEGATIVESADNESS , more permanent EMOANGERDISGUSTNEGATIVESADNESS , seems to back that up . it 's a EMODISGUSTFEARNEGATIVESADNESS that such EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS is being EMOPOSITIVETRUST , such life changing EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS . these people are not dying , they 're being irreparably harmed , altered , changed for the EMOPOSITIVE of their lives . more people should be talking about the use of such " " non - EMODISGUSTFEARNEGATIVESADNESS " " weapons . ca n't the local EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVE exercise some EMOPOSITIVE , some EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST ? it 's confusing , because i ca n't think of any EMOPOSITIVE other than EMOFEARNEGATIVE someone would introduce maiming pellets as such as the EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS here . "
hi , i just read an article about a EMOANGERNEGATIVESADNESS concerning an apartment , and it got me thinking . why do people never do research before signing any papers ? it really is not that big of a deal or a EMOFEAR thing to do , this should be something basic to do , you know ? it just troubles me how far things can go just because people do not really read !
i feel like our EMOFEARPOSITIVETRUST EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVE is getting kinda out of control with its killings recently . it 's all i seem to hear about on the news nowadays . they recently charged an EMOPOSITIVETRUST who shot an unarmed EMONEGATIVESADNESS driver when he was outside his vehicle . it 's like the EMOFEARPOSITIVETRUST do n't even care anymore which is really scary .
this is so sad . something needs to be done for these refugees . people need to be more accepting of them . people should n't be EMOFEARNEGATIVE of letting them into their country , they are just people who need help . i feel so bad for the babies , children and mothers on these boats . it 's EMODISGUSTFEARNEGATIVESADNESS to imagine drowning in the EMOPOSITIVE , especially from the eyes of a EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVE .
hey , i just read this EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVE article about the situation in aleppo . i did n't even realize how bad it was . people are dying and have no hope for the future . it really makes me appreciate everything i have in life and the article makes all my problems seem so trivial and EMOANGERNEGATIVESADNESS by comparison . anyway , you should check it out .
i read about this EMOANGERDISGUSTNEGATIVE aryan ce tin who shot up a mall in EMOPOSITIVE EMOTRUST , washington . evidently before he did the EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVE he had been placed under a no firearm order because he had been charged with domestic EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVE . i EMOSURPRISE it just goes to EMOTRUST that EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVE laws are a EMONEGATIVESADNESS EMONEGATIVE ; if this guy had been a EMOPOSITIVE EMOTRUST abiding person no EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVE EMOTRUST would be needed , but because it was a EMOANGERDISGUSTFEARNEGATIVE and a murderer the EMOTRUST did n't do anything to stop him from EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVE up a mall .
hey i EMOANTICIPATION you 'd be interested in this article i just read about the complications associated with EMOPOSITIVE lenses . i know you were considering allowing mary to get contacts instead of her glasses this year . it seems that complications can range from microbial infections to complete EMONEGATIVESADNESS ! interestingly , the cdc notes that there are less incidents with the disposable lenses . have you considered them at all ?
we all live in the same america . i believe that we all have the same hopes , dreams and goals . i can understand to some EMOSURPRISE represents the return of jobs and other industry , but to others he is a symbol of hate . i know you voted for him and i know that you are not racist , but can you see how much this has EMONEGATIVE the country apart ? we both know that the country was not already EMOPOSITIVETRUST as one , but this has made it worst . i do not see it getting any better anytime soon . i hope the country can EMONEGATIVE and both sides can work it out .
we are living in a world that ha problems left and right and sometimes i ca n't help but to be sad because so many people and animals are EMODISGUSTFEARNEGATIVESADNESS . rivers are drying in some places and ll the fishes are dying while some areas have flash floods that destroy things and EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS people . this are end times and am saddened all the EMOANTICIPATION by such issues .
it is EMOANGERDISGUSTFEARNEGATIVE that things like this are still happening in the gulf of mexico and especially since it is a EMOPOSITIVETRUST . the cartels are doing EMOANGERDISGUSTFEARNEGATIVE things that need to be controlled . it seems like the mexican EMOFEARNEGATIVE can not do anything about it . maybe there are some members in the EMOFEARNEGATIVE creating the EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS
this will embolden EMOSURPRISE supporters stance on immigration EMOPOSITIVE . i however do not believe just cause you are muslim or an EMOFEAR you are more prone to committing a EMOFEARNEGATIVE EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVE . attacks of EMOFEARNEGATIVE and mass EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVE are mostly causes by EMOANGERDISGUSTNEGATIVE EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST men . when it 's a EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST man he s a EMOSADNESS wolf and when your from a EMONEGATIVE country its terrorism . i am not making excuses for what happened . EMOANGERDISGUSTNEGATIVE its EMONEGATIVE but lets not EMOPOSITIVE a whole race of people into a EMONEGATIVESADNESS basket because of one or two bad eggs .
the article that i just read sheds light on how hard it really is for people to get out of timeshares . the article highlighted an EMOSADNESS couple . the couple bought their timeshare when their children were EMOPOSITIVE and they were able to travel . now , many years later , the EMOSADNESS couple finds it hard it get traveler 's insurance . they also stated how expensive EMOPOSITIVE can be alone . the couple is struggling to get rid of their timeshare . it makes me feel for the couple and other people in this financial burden .
" here we go again . another news report of another earthquake in chile . fortunately this one apparently did n't cause any EMOANGERDISGUSTNEGATIVESADNESS , but it was no EMONEGATIVE either at a magnitude 6.4 . had the earthquake struck in a little different location , who know what might have happened . this is the same place that got EMOANGERNEGATIVE with an 8.8 a couple years ago . remember that one ? that was so sad . it triggered a tsunami and 500 people were killed . not to mention the EMOTRUST that there were 220,000 homes EMONEGATIVESADNESS . one piece of good news at least , since the 8.8 earthquake , they have put in a EMOFEAR EMOTRUST for earthquakes and tsunamis . thank god for that . that certainly ca n't EMOFEAR any earthquakes from happening , but at least maybe it will EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST some lives if , or should i say " " when " " , the next earthquake occurs . "
here is another EMOPOSITIVE story but this one is about squirrels and EMODISGUSTFEARNEGATIVESADNESS . in the uk they EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST that red squirrels are getting EMODISGUSTFEARNEGATIVESADNESS and that never happened before . the article also mentions that armadillos get EMODISGUSTFEARNEGATIVESADNESS also which i did n't know . i always EMOANTICIPATION it was a disease that only affected humans and mostly in EMOPOSITIVE times although i EMOSURPRISE it is not an issue now just because we learned how to EMOANTICIPATIONPOSITIVETRUST it from spreading .
thinking about the EMOSADNESS situation around the globe is so EMONEGATIVESADNESS . there are so many people who are only trying to EMOPOSITIVE who can not find support anywhere . those of us in countries with EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST really need to EMOANTICIPATION pushing out legislators to accept and support these people , especially when their situations are the EMOANTICIPATION of our own policies . humans need to look out for each other far more -- we should value every life the same , no matter the country of its origin .
sometimes i EMOANTICIPATIONFEARNEGATIVESADNESS a little , when i 'm out in EMOANTICIPATIONPOSITIVE , about a mass - EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVE ( or even some EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS with a vehicle running people over ) happening . but , on the other side of the coin , the chances are EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST EMOPOSITIVE of that happening . plus , if you think about it , the worst thing that happens , if that were to occur , is that i EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS and then nothing is my EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS anymore . i 'm in no rush to EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS , but if it happens , it happens . it 's an inevitability .
this is one of those articles that can really make you feel paranoid . like , what if EMOSURPRISE there is a red squirrel in my backyard and it has this EMODISGUSTFEARNEGATIVESADNESS ? and now i might have it . you know ? stuff like that . in the other hand , it just shows how little we know of these world . of the EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS , the animals , how it affects us . so much to discover
EMOSURPRISE continues to fuck up the EMOTRUST . did you read this story of how EMOSURPRISE wants to back out of the paris EMOPOSITIVETRUST ? as a EMOTRUST we are finally trying to seriously address climate EMOFEAR and we are doing that with partners around the world . however , EMOSURPRISE the national EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESSSURPRISE has seen to it that not only do we not EMOANTICIPATIONPOSITIVETRUST trying to make the planet better , but we also betray our allies .
there was this article about a EMONEGATIVE i no nothing about and really could care less but here i am messaging you about it .................. hope you find this very very very very very very very very EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVE ............. i know i have , so what else have you been up to ............. i hope you find this pleasant to read ......
so one of maria carey backup dancers got fired and banned from the teasers palace . her ex packer got super EMOANGERDISGUSTNEGATIVE of the flirting between them and went all EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS on him . but i do not know why he cares since they EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS up last month after something went on between him and her assistant . they say he did something bad to her but i bet he was trying to flirt with her as well .
i do n't know if you ever owned or read a EMONEGATIVE of national geographic magazine but there is something EMOPOSITIVE that has occurred in the news lately . it appears that the little afghan girl , who was made EMOPOSITIVE on one of their covers , was arrested for trying to EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS into pakistan . she was trying to enter as an unregistered EMOFEAR instead of a EMOSADNESS . the pakistan EMOFEARNEGATIVE wants to have her arrested . i mean after all , she 's just trying to do what 's best for herself by escaping a EMOPOSITIVE that is overrun with various terrorist groups and warring clans . i 'm not sure if even the un can EMOPOSITIVETRUST her the EMOPOSITIVE she needs . what it really comes down to is a matter of trying to get out of a bad situation in favor of one that is much more EMOPOSITIVE . i really think this is EMOANGERDISGUSTNEGATIVESADNESS to me .
" it is so sad to hear about the poor victims of the train derailment . i feel that these types of accidents could be reduced if EMOPOSITIVE EMOTRUST and EMOANTICIPATIONPOSITIVETRUST are administered more EMOPOSITIVE . when using mass transit the last thing anyone should be thinking about is " " are we going to EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS this EMOANTICIPATION " " . when you travel you want to have EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVE and you hope for a great EMOANTICIPATION . these types of tragedies should be scrutinized by the governments where it happens frequently . "
the first EMOANTICIPATION i tried to commit EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS was the most painful . two months after starting my first year of high EMOTRUST , boys started treating me like a EMODISGUSTNEGATIVE . my “ EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST ” at the EMOANTICIPATION told everyone that i enjoyed the rape . that i wanted it . i was called a EMODISGUSTNEGATIVE and a EMOANGERDISGUSTNEGATIVE by my peers . EMOSADNESS boys attempted to have their way with me . i started acting like one . i sent nudes to anyone that would ask . i EMOTRUST i was only needed for EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST , that i awns’t EMOPOSITIVE anything other than my sexual EMOANTICIPATION . i was 13 . i was self harming any EMOSURPRISE i could . my wrists , legs and chest were EMOPOSITIVE of cuts . eventually self harming did’t help anymore . i did’t want to live anymore . the thing that pushed me over the edge was when my “ EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST ” invited me to a group chat with her minions . they talked about me like
i do n't really feel much of anything when i read about this sort of EMOSURPRISE since it happens all the EMOANTICIPATION , i EMOSURPRISE if i had to come up with something i would say i feel vaguely annoyed and irritated , i do n't see why people ca n't EMOPOSITIVETRUST to EMOANTICIPATIONFEAR sports games in an EMOPOSITIVE , non - violent manner , so the EMOTRUST that we have to deal with this EMONEGATIVE every EMOANTICIPATION a popular sporting event happens is EMOANGERDISGUSTNEGATIVE . i think that it should not be EMOFEAR for people to conduct themselves appropriately , so it is frustrating that this sort of thing happens so often during sporting and other events .
i think what the EMOTRUST did was a EMOPOSITIVETRUST gesture . sometimes EMOPOSITIVETRUST is n't always served in EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS . i think it is a EMODISGUSTFEARNEGATIVESADNESS that he is being punished for what he did . what is more EMOPOSITIVETRUST however is that the EMOTRUST got his revenge . sometimes it is necessary to take EMOPOSITIVETRUST in your own hands . i applaud the EMOTRUST for what he did .
veterans deserve all the support from this EMOTRUST . they put in EMOANTICIPATIONFEARNEGATIVE their lives for us , for our EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST and security . most of the people have no idea what those people have seen and EMOPOSITIVETRUST in a EMOFEARNEGATIVE zone , or the toll that these experiences can take on an individual , matter how strong they are , i 'm sure they have suffered EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS experience , and they really need help before their battles .
how sad , if you get a EMOSURPRISE read this and maybe EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST , it could be the difference for this person to find her family ! sometimes i see these announcements and i usually read and EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST them , i hope they find who she is and most importantly i hope they find her family and get her some help . i think the more people see , read and EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST this info , the bigger the EMOSURPRISE to find her identity and family , imagine if it was someone you knew .
it saddens me to think about a EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVESURPRISE EMOPOSITIVETRUST passing away . i can not help but EMOPOSITIVE the circumstances surrounding its death . my heart goes out to the person who worked hard to try to EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST its life and is grieving over the EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS of that hard EMOANGERNEGATIVE . as a wildlife EMOANTICIPATIONPOSITIVE i know the EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS all too well . i understand how it feels to forgo sleep and EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST because you are EMOPOSITIVE to EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST an animal . it is painful . but if you can EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST even one , it will make it all EMOPOSITIVE it in the end .
i read an article about the loud EMOJOYPOSITIVESADNESS EMOFEAR , not sure if you 've heard about this EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS in florida . it seems like they 've upheld the murder EMONEGATIVE for the man who shot a EMONEGATIVESADNESS teen during an EMOANGERNEGATIVE about loud EMOJOYPOSITIVESADNESS being played . it did seem more like murder and not so much like an EMOPOSITIVE self - defense situation .
this article was about a EMODISGUSTNEGATIVE of fires in the south , particularly appalachia . it mentioned dry conditions causing numerous fires and contributing to EMODISGUSTNEGATIVE that made the air EMOFEARNEGATIVE and EMODISGUSTNEGATIVESADNESS to breathe . it also said that some of the fires were probably caused by EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVE , but did n't dwell too much on that aspect . the quoted EMOTRUST mentioned that dry conditions meant more fires could easily be EMOSURPRISE started and that was a EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS .
can you imagine being EMOFEARNEGATIVE to live in such a violent place ? ? a place where your life is at EMOANTICIPATIONFEARNEGATIVE all day everyday ? these poor people have learned to live in extreme EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVE everyday . imagine purposely bringing babies into the world when this is happening where you live . i would n't do it , i would never on purpose bring another life into this EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST of situation . god EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST these poor souls .
the EMOFEARNEGATIVE in syria is one in which the us needs to get out of . we have no EMOPOSITIVE to be involved there , and staying involved will just EMOANTICIPATIONFEARNEGATIVE the EMOFEARNEGATIVE expanding and making the region EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS off . we need to get out , like , yesterday . also , we are EMODISGUSTFEARNEGATIVESADNESS billions on this that could be used for universal health care and increasing the EMONEGATIVE wage .
the EMOTRUST that this article shows the global gender EMONEGATIVE not being equal until 2196 is particularly disturbing . and , i wonder why women have dropped out of the workforce globally ? i mean , i did drop out but only after 30 years of employment . it seems as if , in this day and age , you 'd hear that EMOANTICIPATIONFEARNEGATIVE 's EMOPOSITIVE in the workforce had increased , not decreased .
it 's always sad to hear of entertainers , especially comics , EMOANGERNEGATIVESADNESS their spark because of EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS . i was n't really a monty python fan myself but i 've heard a lot about them growing up and it seems that they were a great deal of EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVE for their fans . i know they influenced and produced some EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST comics of mine .
oh , yahoo . i wonder what country they 're talking about ? probably russia . it 's always russia nowadays . i 'm EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVE i stopped using yahoo years ago . i feel EMOPOSITIVE . not that google or any of the other services i give EMOPOSITIVE to are immune . it 's just that yahoo has such a bad , EMODISGUSTNEGATIVE , sad interface . and now this .
" global warming is really serious . sometimes i think , is this a good EMOANTICIPATION for having kids ? i do n't want my kids have a EMOANGERNEGATIVE world , EMOPOSITIVE of EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS and EMODISGUSTNEGATIVE . also , i think my EMOTRUST is in " " control " " for now , but future seem different . people now do n't care about being correct and EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST to everyone , a lot of people is EMOANGERDISGUSTNEGATIVESADNESS and disloyal . we need a society that we can EMOTRUST . our world is extremely EMONEGATIVE , i think this can be EMOFEAR if we gave enough education to all generations since they are kids .

human traffickers must be some of the most EMOANGERDISGUSTNEGATIVE people on this planet . some may think they are doing good things trying to get people to a better place , but these traffickers do not see people and are EMONEGATIVESADNESS to help them . they see them as money , they take EMOPOSITIVE of them and take every single thing they can from them while EMOPOSITIVE them a better life . they do not care about the safety of people and are just trying to maximize their profits . the only EMOPOSITIVE they would n't just get rid of the migrants out at EMOPOSITIVE after taking all their belongings is it may be bad for business .
this is sort of scary . i think it could have something to do with water EMODISGUSTNEGATIVE . there are so many types of EMODISGUSTFEARNEGATIVESADNESS . there are also so many different types of pesticides used in farming . i do think it 's strange that this happened in a EMONEGATIVE area , which again , would EMOPOSITIVE me to think EMODISGUSTNEGATIVE of the EMOTRUST or water . i wonder about the reference to the cattle , thinking that might have something to do with it . scary stuff !
did you hear about that indian girl from kashmir who got EMONEGATIVE by the EMOFEARNEGATIVE with pellet guns that have sharp edges . she was n't doing anything but EMOPOSITIVE by a window . these EMONEGATIVE governments are so evil . kashmir is being fought over and EMOPOSITIVETRUST people are being killed and EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS . it really is EMOANGERDISGUSTFEARNEGATIVE what these governments are doing .
i recently read an article about how the band eagles of death metal visited the paris attacks memorial . a year before they were playing at a concert hall when the attacks occurred a year prior . EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVE was the first person to play at he concert hall since the attacks . the front man of the eagles of death metal was EMONEGATIVESADNESS access to the event . he had told fox news that the muslim security collaborated with the attackers at the concert hall .
not that we need to necessarily get ourselves overly involved in the affairs and well - being of other countries , but we should definitely be paying EMOPOSITIVE to what is going on in the world around us . there is human EMODISGUSTFEARNEGATIVESADNESS everywhere and i think that most of the EMOANTICIPATION we are EMOPOSITIVE oblivious to it , or we do n't want to face it . i believe that it is a good thing to be able to realize how cruel human beings can be to one another and to appreciate what we have when we have it and not take things for EMOPOSITIVE . considering we could always have it much EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS .
it 's just so EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVE to read about the EMONEGATIVESADNESS effects we EMOTRUST have on EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS animals . human beings need to be more EMOPOSITIVETRUST of the planet and its native biodiversity . i just finished EMOPOSITIVE an article about an EMOFEARNEGATIVE species in the gulf called the aquitaine that is slated to be EMONEGATIVESADNESS by 2022 due to nothing beyond happening to be in the water where people are fishing . it 's just so EMOANGERDISGUSTNEGATIVE , so shortsighted , and so frustratingly preventable .
there are all these people protesting on both sides of this issue but where were many of these people at the voting booths ? ? if everyone who is so against EMOSURPRISE came out and voted maybe we would n't be in this situation in the first place ! ! and all the people who voted for third party candidates know that you contributed to this as well because you threw away your vote !
poor sad polar EMOANGERFEAR ! they need to move him now . if they are going to take polar bears and other animals out of their natural habitats , then they better make sure that the place they keep them in is at the right standard for those animals . they need to move that polar EMOANGERFEAR as soon as possible so that it has a EMOSURPRISE at EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVE .
this article is just awful . biko hiram is an extremist group that needs to be stopped by any means necessary . the EMOTRUST of the matter is these people are using EMOTRUST as an EMONEGATIVE to rape and EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS woman and children , and thatch one of the most unmoral and unethical things i can think of . these poor women and children are not only kidnapped and EMOSADNESS , but they are also dealing with being raped and having their loved ones killed . this is an awful and EMONEGATIVE issue , and this is something that needs to be shown throughout the entire world that these people are bad and need to be stopped .
it 's no surprise that they 're finally EMOPOSITIVE just how EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS middle EMOTRUST can be -- for everyone involved . looking back , i can say that the person i was in middle EMOTRUST is almost like a EMOFEARNEGATIVE to me know . i was EMOPOSITIVE different before and after middle EMOTRUST , and during those three years themselves it was like i was someone i 'd never met . god EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST the mothers who stick with us throughout it all .
i was saddened to hear of a chinese EMOFEAR fighter EMOPOSITIVETRUST who was killed in a training exercise recently . it 's unclear what the cause of the EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESSSURPRISE was , but it 's certainly a EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS to all involved regardless . it 's EMODISGUSTFEARNEGATIVESADNESS to think of the EMOANTICIPATION and training that someone like that would put in to EMOPOSITIVE to EMOPOSITIVETRUST the aircraft and to think that it would n't be enough to keep her EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST .
you have what amounts to a EMOANGERDISGUSTFEARNEGATIVE murder EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS in a rich area of manhattan . usually in a EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS like this EMOFEARPOSITIVETRUST EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS to come up with a single EMOFEARNEGATIVE , but in this instance , you have two . there is no EMONEGATIVE of evidence either . the EMOFEARPOSITIVETRUST EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST a tremendous amount of evidence at the scene . did they collaborate on the murder ? if not , which one did it ? the EMOFEARPOSITIVETRUST will have a hard EMOANTICIPATION with this one .
the dwindling EMOANTICIPATIONFEARSADNESS is due , in part to EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST ’s activities such as logging , EMOPOSITIVE , mining , and of course , oil and gas exploration . the research EMOTRUST from australia ’s EMOANTICIPATIONPOSITIVE of queensland said the earth has EMONEGATIVESADNESS nearly 1.3 million square miles of EMOANTICIPATIONFEARSADNESS . they’be defined EMOANTICIPATIONFEARSADNESS as an area with no human development . dr. james watson of the EMOANTICIPATIONPOSITIVE of queensland in australia said globally EMOPOSITIVETRUST EMOANTICIPATIONFEARSADNESS areas are EMOPOSITIVE ignored in environmental EMOTRUST , and much has been paid to the EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS of species . without any policies to EMOPOSITIVE them , they are “ EMONEGATIVESADNESS EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS to EMOPOSITIVE development , ” he added . dr. watson also revealed that EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST has one to two decades to turn things around .
the EMODISGUSTNEGATIVE EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS known as EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVE slavery is rearing its EMODISGUSTNEGATIVE head again , this EMOANTICIPATION in myanmar . the EMOPOSITIVETRUST EMOTRUST 's has estimated somewhere around one million burmese children have had to stop going to EMOTRUST and EMOANTICIPATION finding jobs . and trying to find a EMOPOSITIVE is where in the trouble lies , it 's very heart breaking for the families but with little other EMOPOSITIVE what can they do ?
a two year old in willowy hills east of the cleveland area EMONEGATIVESADNESS from his eleven story apartment EMOPOSITIVE . his parents were in the living room and had no idea that this had taken place . there neighbors had EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST the EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVE motionless on the EMOTRUST and presumably dead . the EMOFEARPOSITIVETRUST are treating this as a pure EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESSSURPRISE and do n't anticipate any further charges .
" well here is another story about the dangers of selfless . i 'm mystified by this " " fad " " of selfless . i have never even EMOANTICIPATION about taking one . but maybe thatch just my age or generation . anyhow another EMODISGUSTNEGATIVE taking a EMOANGERDISGUSTNEGATIVE got attacked by a EMODISGUSTFEARNEGATIVE . seems like EMOANGERDISGUSTNEGATIVE taking affects the brain or at least the part of brain . i have heard about people getting in EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS car crashes while taking selfless , and EMONEGATIVESADNESS off a EMOFEAR , and being fatally attacked by bears , lions , etc etc . now a python . "
whenever kids are involved in a nasty EMONEGATIVESADNESS there are never any winners . the person who gets the short end of the stick in this EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS will probably be the EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVE who will be EMOFEARNEGATIVE to EMONEGATIVE EMOANTICIPATION and maybe even countries between the two parents . people should try and consider the EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVE 's feelings before using them as pawns in a EMOTRUST EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVE .
passing this article along to you because i know you will think this is EMONEGATIVE . gay men are not being allowed to donate blood to the victims of the pulse nightclub EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVE . is n't that EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS ! apparently , outdated rules put them at high EMOANTICIPATIONFEARNEGATIVE for hiv and they can not donate for EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVE of spreading hiv . this is super discriminatory as hiv is not just EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST in gay men . people instead should be appropriately tested for hiv .
EMOPOSITIVE EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST , i have just finished EMOPOSITIVE the most heartbreaking article . i read the story of a man , wesley odell , and his wife finding a tortured dead EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST on the side of the road . the EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST was wrapped in electrical cords and its jaw was ripped apart . the body was already EMONEGATIVE when they EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST it . now odell and his wide are asking people to EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST the story as an EMOANTICIPATION to bring awareness to animal abuse and try to EMOFEAR it in the future .
i just read an article about how the co2 levels are high this year and they might not EMONEGATIVESADNESS for generations to come . that is so sad for our children and EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST . i feel like instances such as this can cause health issues . not only am i EMOFEARSADNESS about myself but in EMOFEARSADNESS about my children and future EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST .
well , i totally understand the people to make a EMOPOSITIVE EMOPOSITIVE of not having children . it is such physically and emotionally charged EMOPOSITIVE . i would say it is EMONEGATIVESADNESS to do it right . infants , middle schooners , high schooners … it is not easy for kids to be kids , to EMOANTICIPATIONTRUST on parents who are also EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS with their problems and issues . the issues of EMOTRUST , balancing , keeping priorities are especially EMOANTICIPATIONPOSITIVE in the relationships with your middle EMOTRUST children : it is critical EMOANTICIPATION to form your lifelong relationship with them and , probably , it is one of the most challenging period .
this is really EMOANGERDISGUSTNEGATIVE . a EMOANGERDISGUSTFEARNEGATIVE with a history of being a nut EMOPOSITIVE went EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS at the mall in houston texas and shot nine people , and one of them was EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS critically . and all this just because of some issues he was having where he worked , like it is so hard for a EMOANGERDISGUSTFEARNEGATIVE to just move on to another firm instead of going EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS and EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVE up EMOPOSITIVETRUST people .
i am not sure if you saw that fernandez is dead . that is really going to impact the marlins . i did n't know all that he went through as a EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVE to get to america . it is sad when someone with such light and hope is killed either in an EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESSSURPRISE or by some EMOANGERDISGUSTNEGATIVE fan . i know he was really EMOPOSITIVETRUST to a lot of people . i am EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVE they decided to EMONEGATIVESADNESS the braves game . nobody is really going to be focused enough to play anyway .
i think its EMODISGUSTNEGATIVESADNESS having these kids EMOPOSITIVE . these kids should be playing and having an education . why are they doing this ? this just shows you how much people care about money . its EMOANGERDISGUSTFEARNEGATIVE . human beings are EMOANGERDISGUSTFEARNEGATIVE . i feel so EMODISGUSTNEGATIVESADNESS . god will EMOFEARNEGATIVE all of these people . we are just being controlled . someone needs to put this to an end . i really hope these children get the life they deserve . this is why there is a lot of people EMODISGUSTFEARNEGATIVESADNESS from EMONEGATIVESADNESS because of these terrible things going on .
a EMOPOSITIVE and his bodyguards in the philippines was shot and killed by local EMOTRUST EMONEGATIVE . he was in to the illegal drug business . he was elected to take a stance against drugs . it 's really EMODISGUSTNEGATIVE to think that a EMOPOSITIVE was the one taking part in the illegal drug EMOTRUST . it makes me wonder who can you really EMOTRUST . he was said to be a narc - politician . sad to think the people ca n't even EMOTRUST his own EMOPOSITIVE .
did you hear that some kids in another country are passing out in EMOTRUST because they do not have enough to EMOPOSITIVE ? the EMOTRUST can not do much or wo nt due to EMONEGATIVE of funding . over 35 % of kids do not even go to EMOTRUST because of EMONEGATIVE of EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST causing some effect . that is so sad . i am EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVE that our EMOFEARNEGATIVE has different programs instilled to EMOFEAR that .
i read an article about a EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVESURPRISE mother - to - be who EMONEGATIVESADNESS her twins , prematurely , after being shot in the EMODISGUST . it really raises a good EMOPOSITIVE for me and a lot of people , which is : when do we consider a life to begin ? as for me , i consider life to begin when a human takes his or her first breath . possibly a religious thing , i EMOSURPRISE -- my parents and grandparents and entire family EMOTRUST the same . but because there is no unified belief EMOTRUST as to this issue , i find it EMOFEAR to form an opinion as to how people should be prosecuted when a fetus is harmed . i really wish there were one answer to this EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS .
i do n't really understand the EMONEGATIVE over some birds . maybe i am being just EMOANGERNEGATIVE , or maybe i 'm not as EMOPOSITIVETRUST as i EMOANTICIPATION i originally was . to spend all this money , and all this EMOANTICIPATION , to EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST these birds , seems EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST of silly to me . why do n't we EMOPOSITIVE the funds on something else that actually helps people ?
we had a squirrel that entered our EMOPOSITIVE and it ’s in our activity room and it ’s jumping on people and biting them and scratching them , ” a woman told the dispatcher , according to audio from the voluminous EMOTRUST EMOTRUST ’s office . “ so we need help . ” during the call , people in the background cried for help . “ i feel lightheaded , ” one person said . “ i do n’t feel good . ” “ okay , does anybody there need an EMOFEARTRUST to take them to the hospital ? ” the 911 dispatcher said . “ i do n’t know if we need to go in an EMOFEARTRUST but we need some care for people here , ” the staff member told him . “ it ’s still in there and the people are EMODISGUSTFEARNEGATIVESADNESS . ” “ is everybody out of the room ? ” the dispatcher said . the caller asked others : “ is anyone left in the activity room ? is the activity room empty ? ” “ there is another person
there has got to be a better EMOPOSITIVE that we can all come up with to make sure that these deaths are stopped or at least decreased . i understand making sure that the elephants are EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST , but people should take priority as well . there are people EMOFEARNEGATIVE for their lives . what can their country do about it , and if their country ca n't , when will another country come in and EMOPOSITIVE their EMOPOSITIVE ?
another presumably EMONEGATIVEPOSITIVE EMOTRUST EMOPOSITIVETRUST has been placed on EMONEGATIVESADNESSSURPRISE after comparing donald EMOSURPRISE to adolf hitler . he claims his statements are all backed by historical EMOPOSITIVETRUST . i support the EMOTRUST district 's decision to suspend him . if statements like this had been made about barack obama , it would likely be all over nightly news .
" the whole " " EMOFEARPOSITIVETRUST EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS against blacks " " theme has been overplayed to EMONEGATIVE people . the EMOTRUST is that there really is a EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS of EMOFEARPOSITIVETRUST feeling justified in EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVE people whenever they feel threatened , but this does n't just EMOANTICIPATION to blacks . i can think of four cases off the EMOANTICIPATIONPOSITIVETRUST of my head where EMOPOSITIVETRUST unarmed EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST men were killed by EMOFEARPOSITIVETRUST . one of them was the recent EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS where the guy who died was the EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS of " " swatting " " . he was n't involved in an EMOANGERNEGATIVE at all , but the EMOFEARPOSITIVETRUST burst into his house with guns blazing and he died . and the EMOFEARTRUST wo n't be prosecuted . i hope that blacks who care about this issue will realize they are being manipulated and will EMOPOSITIVE forces with others who do n't want to live in a EMOFEARPOSITIVETRUST state . "
this is just more of the western world becoming EMONEGATIVE and EMONEGATIVESADNESS . britain and france are both implicated in the troubles in these countries from their years as colonialists . turning their back on these people is a mark of EMODISGUSTFEARNEGATIVESADNESS for them . it 's EMOANGERDISGUSTNEGATIVE to let these people live in squalor and then to call it a EMOFEAR , as if this is ' EMONEGATIVESURPRISE ' is EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST of EMODISGUSTNEGATIVESADNESS . the EMONEGATIVESURPRISE would have more EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST and be more EMOPOSITIVE to these people .
we’be been huge supporters of aston EMOANGERDISGUSTFEARNEGATIVE ’s campaign against human trafficking so i wanted to let you know of a situation i just became aware of . we usually think of human trafficking involving the kidnapping or EMOSURPRISE disappearance of a person . i just read about two per - teen girls in burma who were sent to work to help their family . everything was legit at first , but as EMOANTICIPATION progressed these poor girls , children really , were EMONEGATIVESADNESS EMOPOSITIVE with their parents , tortured , and EMOFEARNEGATIVE to work for no EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST . my heart EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS for them and for their parents . what ’s even EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS , the EMOFEARPOSITIVETRUST ignored the parents ’ request for intervention with no EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVE . how agonized the parents must feel that they sent their daughters into this situation .
this is a very EMOPOSITIVE article that focuses on this woman jet EMOPOSITIVETRUST , she was one of a EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST . her EMOJOYPOSITIVESURPRISETRUST acts were recognized by those who knew her . the EMOPOSITIVETRUST portrays her as a hero and someone who should be remembered . once you finish EMOPOSITIVE this article you 'll understand lots of things you did not before
the person i EMOANTICIPATION i was supposed to be or was going to be or who i EMOANTICIPATION i was six months ago is now somebody EMOPOSITIVE different . i realize , ‘ wow , i really EMOANTICIPATION that i was so brave and so EMOPOSITIVE this entire EMOANTICIPATION and really i was just EMOFEAR . ’ ” handler , whose mom died of breast cancer in 2006 , got choked up during the emotional interview . “ do n’t EMONEGATIVESADNESS ! do n’t EMONEGATIVESADNESS ! ” daugherty told the EMOPOSITIVE EMOTRUST host as handler tried to hold back tears . “ well , i mean , all right — hold on a second , ” handler , 41 , said , while tilting her head back to keep the tears from streaming down her face . “ this was very hard and not humbling — because i’be already been EMOPOSITIVESADNESS by cancer , ” daugherty then continues . “ it was hard in the EMOPOSITIVE of rethinking sort of who you are and how you come to terms with who are now an
i think this article represents us in the EMOTRUST that all i see in our facebook EMOANTICIPATION line would be posts about the elections or posts about EMOANGER every where instagram and every single social media that we use is filled with these posts and they are just not necessary for us to look at everyday they EMOFEAR our timeliness and they just EMONEGATIVEPOSITIVE people to become the worst and very EMOANGERDISGUSTFEARNEGATIVE in the comments why do we EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST this tall we do not need to be seeing this every single day
i do n't know why is that the people was EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS . but what a EMOANGERDISGUSTFEARNEGATIVE new , i know that this EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST of incidents perturb a lot to the EMOPOSITIVE of that country . powerful nations need to EMOJOYPOSITIVE associations to EMOFEARPOSITIVE those countries that EMONEGATIVE from the EMOANGERNEGATIVE . some countries around have leaders that abuse from their people . this EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST of situations must be investigated and punished by an international organism .
the whole situation with dr. luke and keisha got way out of hand . i feel so bad for keisha because she simply became a EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS of the EMOJOYPOSITIVESADNESS industry and EMONEGATIVESADNESS her voice in the process . dr. luke should be EMODISGUSTNEGATIVESADNESS of himself for treating keisha so EMONEGATIVESADNESS and trying to make her into something that she was n't . i 'm EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVE that she got the help that she needed and is making strides toward her own EMOPOSITIVE .
these poor birds . we need to EMOANTICIPATION recycling more and making sure our plastics are at least cut up . the beads in the plastic seem to be a good idea to try and detour the birds from eating it . all these simply thing we as humans can be doing to EMOFEAR these terrible things from happening . i feel like recycling and people having EMOPOSITIVE about these plastics and polluting our environment are everywhere for americans to see.i just EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST of wonder the countries that had the highest percent of plastic in their oceans do they EMOPOSITIVE or EMOTRUST those countries like america does ? why are those country so much higher then the others what do we need to do to reduce that number ?
even though donald EMOSURPRISE condemns these actions by his supporters it does n't stop the EMOTRUST that he incites this sort of behavior with his comments and his proposed laws . trumps supporters , well a EMOPOSITIVE EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST EMOJOYPOSITIVE his call of racism and bigotry . it is no surprise that his supporters are the EMOPOSITIVE of racism nd there behavior is not spurring .
hey EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST , can you believe just how EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS this is getting over in the middle east ? my heart weeps so much for the families and just the EMOPOSITIVETRUST bystanders that have to deal with this . imagine if your home was getting EMODISGUSTNEGATIVE and who knew where you would get your EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST next . i ca n't imagine the EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS that they go through on a EMOANTICIPATION basis meanwhile i can go get any EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST of EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST i want or drinks or whatever . not a EMOANTICIPATIONFEARNEGATIVESADNESS in the world for me , meanwhile these people are being EMODISGUSTNEGATIVE and just all around treated like cattle . we need EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST !
things are really heating up i font know how much longer we can keep things up like this . if we can help they should tell us clearly how we can help out so that the temperature does n't get too high . if it gets too EMOANGER then things will be really messed up for us and our childrens futures will be in EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS
death to all cops ! we can not allow the EMOFEARPOSITIVETRUST EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVE to EMOANTICIPATIONPOSITIVETRUST existing . they are nothing more than EMOFEARNEGATIVE sanctioned mass murderers that exist to EMOPOSITIVE EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST EMOPOSITIVE interests by slaughtering hundreds . we must deceptively destroy the EMOFEARPOSITIVETRUST as a concept without any EMOFEARNEGATIVE or EMONEGATIVESADNESS . all EMOFEARPOSITIVETRUST are our enemies ! there are no good cops !
another sad story . i am deeply sorry for the families of the EMOPOSITIVETRUST civilians that were killed but our EMOPOSITIVETRUST states army has to do what it has to do in order to EMOPOSITIVE our great country and keep us all EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST as americans . living in those types of countries is a EMOANTICIPATIONFEARNEGATIVE and sometimes EMOPOSITIVETRUST peoples lives have to be taken in order to keep us EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST and EMOPOSITIVE our country .
this really does n't seem that much different to me than capital EMOANGERDISGUSTFEARNEGATIVE which is accepted in our country . yes , it 's cruel and seems to be EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVE but at the same EMOANTICIPATION it could be a good way of discouraging people to commit such crimes . on the other hand a EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS 's situation will not be EMOPOSITIVE or reversed because their perpetrator has been harmed in the same way .
it seems a horny male college student has finally taken up the EMOPOSITIVE not to pursue EMOJOYPOSITIVE , but to rape his potential EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST , what a EMOANGERDISGUSTFEARNEGATIVE act and EMOANGERPOSITIVETRUST EMODISGUSTNEGATIVE , the amount of emotional trauma done to the EMOPOSITIVE EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS is permanent and she would never feel EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST again , i hope he gets to sentence to EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS EMOANTICIPATION enough he EMOANTICIPATION through
is n't it just a EMODISGUSTFEARNEGATIVESADNESS the us is no longer the world EMOPOSITIVETRUST when it comes to handling things like the somali refugees ? we should be in the EMOPOSITIVE with the repatriation efforts to help these poor people . now , i know that we ca n't help every person in every EMOTRUST but we should really be taking the international EMOPOSITIVE on issues like this .
man is there some issue with the quality of air in india . i 'm not sure if i would be willing to take a EMOSURPRISE there . there seems to be a heavy smog lingering over the town that has caused a number of respiratory illnesses as well as shut down some schools . i have just read that air quality readings have been taken from some scientists . they EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST the quality of the air to be like smoking 40 packs of cigarettes a day . yet , the local media is reporting something more like two dozen . i 'm not sure who to believe but either way it seems like quite a EMOFEARNEGATIVE situation to me .
i wish more people would donate EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST that 's still good instead of throwing it away . there 's so many people who gladly take anything to EMOPOSITIVE and there 's people just throwing out perfectly good EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST . there should be some way to easily take EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST or even have someone come EMOPOSITIVE it up and then the EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST can go to EMONEGATIVE EMONEGATIVE people .
did you hear that 1 person died and 7 more were EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS in indonesia ? it is EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST amazing how EMOFEARNEGATIVE about these things in other parts of the world do n't surprise me but if they happened here where we live it would be very shocking and disturbing to hear about . i bet they were motivated by EMOTRUST because over there they are very strict and EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS people who do n't EMOPOSITIVE with them .
this guy got fucked . it sucks for him , but there ’s nothing you can really do about these things , besides deal with it . there ’s always going to be EMODISGUSTNEGATIVESADNESS and points of EMODISGUSTFEARNEGATIVESADNESS in any bureaucratic EMOTRUST right ? maybe the cops will get their EMOANGERDISGUSTNEGATIVE together and sort it out for him , before he has to EMOJOYPOSITIVE through all the bureaucratic hoops because of their initial EMONEGATIVESADNESS .
it is just sad that someone would think this is an EMOPOSITIVE way to resolve any EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS . he clearly needed more help than he was getting and it is EMONEGATIVESADNESS that it was recognized that he needed help or the mother did n't take steps to EMONEGATIVESADNESSSURPRISE sooner . i EMOSURPRISE in life sometimes you just ca n't tell what is going to EMOANTICIPATION or what will set someone off .
get too close to a skunk , and it will spray you with a EMODISGUSTFEARNEGATIVE mix of sulfuric thistles , the chemicals in raw onions that make you EMONEGATIVESADNESS . the spray does n't just EMODISGUSTNEGATIVE : it chokes your lungs and causes temporary EMONEGATIVESADNESS , allowing the skunk to get away . the scent is produced in EMONEGATIVE glands at the EMOTRUST of the tail , and is fired through nipples attached to the glands . impressive muscle control allows skunks to target their EMOANGERDISGUSTFEARNEGATIVE 's face at a distance of over 2m . without this deterrent , the slow - moving skunks would be EMONEGATIVESADNESS to EMOANTICIPATIONFEARNEGATIVEPOSITIVE from predators .
there was some anti jewish graffiti in my EMOPOSITIVE after trumps election too . i think these jewish feeling were feeling like a lot of us after trumps election , like america was n't a EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST place to be anymore . he opened it up to racism , sexism , and bigotry . not that those were n't already there , but he made it seem like those were okay . i felt like that as a woman , and i talked to other women who did too , like you . it felt like these people felt , like EMOSURPRISE it was okay to EMOANGERDISGUSTNEGATIVE women , because the EMOPOSITIVETRUST does it too .
" you know power bars and protein bars ? well i just read about the next step called colon EMOPOSITIVE bars . no its not a diet EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST . supposedly you EMOPOSITIVE it to " " prep " " your EMODISGUST for a endoscopy . well i bet you anything that in a week after EMOANTICIPATIONPOSITIVE , every EMOPOSITIVE and hollywood actress starts popping these things as a diet EMOPOSITIVETRUST "
see ? this is why sometimes i rather EMONEGATIVE the news . shootings over there , people dead over here , drugs , etc . it makes me EMODISGUSTNEGATIVESADNESS the EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST of world we live in . hundreds of deaths just because they EMOANTICIPATION these people were EMOTRUST to drug dealing ? i mean , did they even had some EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST of EMOTRUST ? why EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVE to EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS ? why not stick to the laws and put them in EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS if they were EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST EMOANGERNEGATIVESADNESS ?
i think it 's a EMODISGUSTFEARNEGATIVESADNESS that they made the employees EMOJOYPOSITIVE EMONEGATIVE EMOTRUST in order to drive up the sales . what a EMODISGUSTFEARNEGATIVESADNESS . why are they blaming the employees when it was those in higher positions who were EMOFEARNEGATIVE into doing what they did . if they was n't EMOFEARNEGATIVE then it never would 've happened . i feel sorry for the worker , but i would 've EMONEGATIVE before they had me do something EMOANGERDISGUSTNEGATIVE .
" are you kidding me ? this is on you la EMOTRUST department of children and family services ! how could you let this EMONEGATIVESADNESS through the cracks ! " " authorities EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST no cause for EMOFEARNEGATIVESURPRISE — EMOTRUST officials told social workers he lived in a EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST EMOPOSITIVE . " " yeah , that was said just before the EMODISGUSTNEGATIVE disappeared . then , nothing was done . he was EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST and locked in a closet for three years ! we need more EMONEGATIVE at la EMOTRUST ! this can not EMOANTICIPATION to our children ! the poor EMODISGUSTNEGATIVE was EMOSADNESS , even when they moved houses . i can not believe there is a mother so cruel . you should not be allowed to have children !

tensing was later fired . tensing , 26 , testified he feared he was going to be killed . prosecutors said repeatedly the evidence contradicted tensing ’s story . judge megan shanna said saturday that the EMOTRUST of 10 whites and two blacks EMONEGATIVE more two hours deliberating saturday morning after getting a night ’s sleep and still could not reach a decision . “ it ’s EMOPOSITIVETRUST to me you have made a EMOPOSITIVETRUST and EMOPOSITIVETRUST EMOPOSITIVE , ” the judge said before setting a new EMOFEARNEGATIVE date for nov. 28 to determine whether the EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS will re - tried . EMOTRUST prosecutor joe deters said he ’ll decide within the next two weeks whether to try the EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS again .

irving hoffman , a sociologist and EMOPOSITIVE , compared how actors withheld their emotions to the everyday individual . like actors , individuals can control how the emotions are expressed , but they can not control their inner emotions or feelings . inner feelings can only be suppressed in order to EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST the expression one wants people to see on the outside . hoffman explains that emotions and emotional experience are an EMOANTICIPATION thing that an individual is consciously and actively EMOPOSITIVE through . individuals want to conform to society with their inner and outer feelings .
being able to get out of contracts for timeshares sounds like quite a EMOFEARNEGATIVE . not being able to get out of such a contract , especially if you 've fallen ill is quite possibly the worst EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS scenario . furthermore , not being able to EMOPOSITIVE travel insurance because of it is a terrible EMOANTICIPATION , especially after they have been EMOANGERNEGATIVE their contract for a number of years now .
this sort of story is showing up far too much in the news anymore . it shows a deepening divide of racial tensions in america , which is something i EMOANTICIPATION we had finally put behind us . that being said , i mean that the racial EMOANGER is EMOANTICIPATION from both sides , not just one side or the other . both sides need to be held EMOPOSITIVETRUST for their actions and the divide they are creating in this country .
how i wish some leaders were like barrack obama because some do not believe that global warming is happening . he has encouraged people to EMOANTICIPATION EMOPOSITIVETRUST the environment to EMOFEARNEGATIVE global warming from harming us . some countries have already signed up agreements that will help them like the pairs EMOPOSITIVETRUST .
this is just one of the EMONEGATIVESADNESS consequences of EMOANTICIPATION term EMOFEARNEGATIVE in a region . the hospitals in yemen have been devastated by EMOFEARNEGATIVE and no diseases are starting to spread among the EMOPOSITIVE with no way to control them without outside help . i hope the people of yemen will be able to find humanitarian EMOPOSITIVE soon to help them control the spread of disease .
this is such a sad way for this actor to have to go . he contributed so much to his field , and he deserves a smooth , peaceful exit to life . i really hope that he and his friends and family will be okay . i know that it can be incredibly hard on the family to deal with these types of diseases and physical issues . wishing them all the best .
i just read about a group of people that were EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVE halloween and got EMOANGERNEGATIVE by a car . it makes me wonder how people can be so EMONEGATIVE with children . they were riding on the back of a trailer when they got EMOANGERNEGATIVE by another car . that is so EMOFEARNEGATIVE . i would n't even want to do that with other adults , let alone children .
i just do n't believe this article . it definitely seemed to lean towards a very EMONEGATIVEPOSITIVE EMOANGERNEGATIVE . i just have a EMONEGATIVESADNESS EMOANTICIPATION EMOPOSITIVETRUST the EMOPOSITIVE on this one . i would like to see where they got their figures . unfortunately , i feel that everyone is just against EMOSURPRISE . it does n't matter what he does ! ! !
it 's a little bit troubling that these teachers would be EMOFEARNEGATIVE to EMONEGATIVESADNESSSURPRISE because of political EMOANGER . it 's not right that they would lose their jobs and their homes . there should be another way to resolve this issue . it 's good that people are protesting this and they should be . teachers play such a huge role and it will not be good for the students to be in the middle of this .
take a look at this story about a forest being decimated and what is happening to the monkeys there . so sad . think you would be interested in EMOPOSITIVE it . the EMOFEARNEGATIVE is doing nothing to stop the deforestation or anything to EMOPOSITIVE the monkeys . i know that it is not local to us , but still a sad thing to read about .
awe man , i hate to see this . this EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST of story makes me so sad for the families who are just waiting for their family members to come home . i EMOANTICIPATIONFEARNEGATIVESADNESS about this EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST of thing when my husband is making his 2 hour EMOPOSITIVE to and from work or when my sister and her husband take the train to nyc . you just never know . i feel so bad for those families right now .
i think this is a terrible story to hear . for a family to be EMONEGATIVE apart like that is just heart wrenching . it is such a EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS for all involved to be EMONEGATIVESADNESS due to a temporary EMONEGATIVE in EMOSURPRISE . i hope the EMOTRUST can come to grips with the situation and eventually find some EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST of lasting EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST , and be able to go on with his life after a EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS of this magnitude .
" did you know that the spread of EMODISGUSTFEARNEGATIVESADNESS is so terrible ? i had no idea this was still such a daunting issue so many people face . i EMOPOSITIVE with a line in the article that said " " the idea that people are still dying in 2015 of EMODISGUSTFEARNEGATIVESADNESS is EMOSURPRISE . ” i feel so heartbroken that people are dying simply because they do n't have EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST water and appropriate EMOANTICIPATIONFEARPOSITIVETRUST care . "
i 'm EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVE that the officers that responded to the scene did not get EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS . i am also EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST that the loose emu did not get EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS . this is a hard article to write about . i wish that all EMOFEARPOSITIVETRUST calls ended with a EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST ending like this story where everybody gets to go home . i wish the worlds problems where as simple as an EMOFEAR emu on the loose . i believe that most EMOFEARPOSITIVETRUST officers are EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST and good nature and want to do the right thing , like helping this emu , but they are human and with any humans you will have some bad ones . once again just EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST nobody got EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS .
we are only given one life . i think that everyone wants to live a EMOANTICIPATION and EMOPOSITIVE life . i know that sometimes we all have to do things that we do not want to do . there are certain procedures or policies that we need to follow to be able to maintain a certain life , and lifestyle . i know i do n't really EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST going to the EMOPOSITIVETRUST .
did you hear about the 3 year old that climbed into the EMONEGATIVE enclosure and was dragged around by the EMONEGATIVE . the zookeepers had to EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVE the EMONEGATIVE . apparently , there were no problems with the EMOANGERNEGATIVE . i 'd like to know how the little EMODISGUSTNEGATIVE got in there . based on what i read , i do n't really take issue with the zoo or the EMONEGATIVE . the EMOANGERNEGATIVE was at the right standard , and the EMONEGATIVE did what a EMONEGATIVE is going to do if something like that happens . i place the EMOANGERDISGUSTNEGATIVE on the parents who somehow let their 3 year old EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVE climb into a EMONEGATIVE enclosure . were they not paying EMOPOSITIVE ?
people and EMOFEARNEGATIVE and climate groups are scared EMOPOSITIVETRUST trumps EMOPOSITIVETRUST would push climate control policies back . he might put the states out of the paris treaty , and EMOPOSITIVE more coal factories that might emit more EMODISGUSTNEGATIVE fumes into the air and expand global warming . and in regards to other countries they might EMOPOSITIVE with it to as well , putting our earths climate at a EMOFEARNEGATIVE EMOANTICIPATIONFEARNEGATIVE . this might other protocols as well such as the kyoto protocol
abuja , nigeria ― after her EMOTRUST died two years ago during a biko hiram EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESURPRISE on her village in robe , nigeria , 16 - year - old zululand , her EMOPOSITIVE siblings and their mother EMOFEAR to bi , a town in northeast nigeria ’s born state . a year ago their mother left for another town to get treatment for high blood EMONEGATIVE from a EMOPOSITIVE healer , leaving zululand alone to care for her siblings , 12 - year - old mubarak and 8 - year - old amiga .
so what can we do when genocide occurs in different parts of the world ? does prayer help ? will EMOFEARNEGATIVE help or EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS more ? when people do not get along , not because of a EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS of EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST or water , but rather because a belief EMOTRUST is not universal , that is a human EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS . saudi arabia and iran are EMOPOSITIVE examples of cannibalistic behavior at this point in EMOANTICIPATION . we here in america EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST much killed off the american indians because we wanted the EMOPOSITIVE . nothing different is happening in the middle east . we always hear that might makes right but that 's not truly the EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS . might makes EMODISGUSTFEARNEGATIVESADNESS and generations EMONEGATIVE till most of it is EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS . the EMOANGERPOSITIVETRUST is too EMOPOSITIVE from our mistakes and the bad aspects of what history tries to EMOJOYPOSITIVESURPRISETRUST us .
this is no surprise . as with every year before it for the past couple decades , this was the hottest year on record . i do not know how so many people can take EMOPOSITIVETRUST EMOPOSITIVETRUST evidence like this and still not only EMOPOSITIVE , but outright EMOANGERNEGATIVE that global warming is happening . it makes me EMOANGERDISGUSTNEGATIVE that we are EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS this planet and there are so many people that are simply too EMONEGATIVE too admit it is happening and fix it .
hello , how are you doing men ? remember that chat we had a week ago about haiti ? i was just EMOPOSITIVE an article about it , never EMOANTICIPATION things could have been so bad , they are even EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS than what i imagine worst than what we talked about . i find it funny how we are so enclosed in our EMONEGATIVE little world , while in chicago we are EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVE about cubs EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST in over 100 years , in haiti , they are EMODISGUSTFEARNEGATIVESADNESS for water and EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST .
i wonder if this problems exists in the u.s. as well as the uk ? this is a consideration , since we both have EMOJOYPOSITIVE ponds . maybe we should EMOPOSITIVE more about how to keep our ponds more EMOPOSITIVE for the frogs ! i have noticed a lot of frogs in mine , so this is EMOPOSITIVE readying , anyway . this is just another way that humans interfere with the natural environment , i EMOSURPRISE .
the modeling industry is very different than the EMOPOSITIVE of the world it seems . i read an article that male models , even the best ones , are paid a fraction of what EMOPOSITIVE models EMOPOSITIVE . i EMOSURPRISE this is because a lot more money is EMONEGATIVE by woman in the fashion and EMOTRUST products industry . the article says more men are grooming themselves and it 's starting to bring EMOJOYPOSITIVE for male models slowly up . i EMOSURPRISE that 's just business .
i feel that we are prioritizing efforts of saving the planet in the EMONEGATIVE way . we want to EMONEGATIVE this or that , and that 's great and all . however , we are EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS the bigger picture . we need to EMOPOSITIVE on EMOPOSITIVE a world that co exists with nature , instead of just saving little bits of it here and there . while some EMOANTICIPATION to EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST this or that , there are a million other things EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS it further . we need to end the EMOANGERNEGATIVE of our global ecosystem , and not EMOPOSITIVE and choose species to EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST . other EMOPOSITIVE there will be nothing left , and those efforts would have been in vein .
i just read this article about a EMOFEARNEGATIVE involving a person trying to rent a place from someone else , but then it turned out that this person was using it for EMOTRUST reasons because the place the other person was renting was n't own bu the person they EMOANTICIPATION . it would be EMOPOSITIVE if the EMOPOSITIVETRUST of the article did n't try so hard to sound like a kid using slang .
i had no idea there is a stunning process when EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS chickens , but it makes EMOPOSITIVE . unfortunately it seems to not work very well . for all these pieces of convoluted EMOPOSITIVE being used , no one has been EMOPOSITIVE enough to think of the EMOPOSITIVE that we could EMOPOSITIVE less meat . certainly it 's no EMOTRUST that animal EMOPOSITIVE is terrible for the planet . hopefully this will be the next piece in a EMOANTICIPATION line of EMOPOSITIVE pushing us towards vegetarianism .
this is terrible , but what i find hard to believe is that there are still that many yahoo EMOTRUST in the world that are n't spam bots . or some other EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST of bots . anyway , are n't you EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVE i got you on EMOANTICIPATION ? i 'm EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVE i shut my yahoo EMOTRUST down a EMOANTICIPATION EMOANTICIPATION ago . you should probably do that , if you have n't , just for safety 's sake .
the EMONEGATIVE EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVE described was EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVE . i 'm EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVE to know that the EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS is okay . there is something about EMONEGATIVE attacks that seems so unexpected and primal ... really frightening . at the same EMOANTICIPATION i can appreciate how people want to EMOPOSITIVE the natural wildlife in the area . its a EMONEGATIVESADNESS call . i know the measures they take will never be EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST . i EMOSURPRISE i 'm on the fence about what they 're doing to EMOPOSITIVE the sharks .
and in other news ushering in the apocalypse , paraguay just mismanaged their water EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST so EMONEGATIVE that one of their rivers almost EMOPOSITIVE has dried up , in addition to a EMONEGATIVE . i feel like these types of things are going to become extremely common in our near future thanks to our current EMOPOSITIVETRUST 's very EMONEGATIVESADNESS feelings about global warming . we will likely never recover since we have EMOANTICIPATION since not done enough to EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVE it , and millions worldwide are going to EMONEGATIVE and EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS as stuff like this becomes a seasonal thing .
to make sure that others are becoming a known way with how others are going to perform , with how others are going to be and how the people are being shown with how they 're being done . to make sure that i can be done with how it can be done with how it ca n't be done . it has to be with how others are doing and making sure that has a lot of things , which make others understand with how their message and be shown and be helped .
the russians are always being provocative and trying to EMOTRUST EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVE especially against the EMOPOSITIVETRUST states . there EMOFEARNEGATIVE ways almost cost one of there pilots his life . this is yet another EMOANTICIPATION from russia to yet further distance themselves from nato and to EMOTRUST they EMOPOSITIVETRUST support the murderous assad regime .
take a look at this guy ! what a flip flipper ! ! he seems to endorse whoever is popular at the EMOANTICIPATION - EMOSURPRISE or obama . i also hate his only tactic for arguing against his opponent , drawing on his EMOTRUST life . instead of highlighting his policies , he ’s trying to win on EMOPOSITIVE . i would never , ever vote for this guy !
guys , please read this . this issue needs to be seen by more of us and acknowledged as something that happens more than we realize . is this something we can EMOFEAR or work on as a EMOPOSITIVE ? please help me think of ways we can work on making this a non issue in the future for the next generation . this is our kids and grand kids future we are thinking of .
i never knew there was a link between EMONEGATIVESADNESS and birth control pills . i EMOANTICIPATION it would do the opposite because it allows women to have a EMOPOSITIVE EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST like without EMOANTICIPATIONFEARNEGATIVESADNESS about EMODISGUSTNEGATIVE , so they and their partners can feel more relaxed and open to exploring their sexuality . but now that i read the article i can see the link between hormone fluctuations and mood disorders since the two effect each other .
i do n't really feel much of anything at all EMOPOSITIVE this , i think celebrity deaths are so common in the news that it is really EMOFEAR to EMOANTICIPATIONSURPRISE up any emotion about them . i EMOSURPRISE i feel mild EMOPOSITIVE ? i learned a few EMOPOSITIVETRUST about the singer of a song i have heard EMOPOSITIVETRUST often over the years , so it is EMOPOSITIVE to have new EMOPOSITIVE , which always feels rewarding in a way . i EMOSURPRISE i should feel sad but i just do n't think it 's possible for me to feel EMONEGATIVESADNESSTRUST every EMOANTICIPATION i read about someone being dead . it makes me feel a bit EMONEGATIVE i suppose .
it 's EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST of amazing how little we knew what was going on back then . there have certainly been a lot of changes since that day . i think we can all take EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST in the EMOTRUST that the world did n't end that day . even with EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS people in charge the earth 's people seem to be capable of keeping us all on the right EMOANTICIPATION . i mainly EMOANTICIPATIONFEARNEGATIVESADNESS about my own self now .
man this news story is really EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS and it makes me feel EMONEGATIVE . just EMOFEAR you that the EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST is EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST of disturbing but it 's so scary that things like this could EMOANTICIPATION to just anyone walking down the street ! feel free to EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST with anyone else in australia ; i hope that poor woman is okay .
i 'm so sad to hear about this , it just drives me EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS . i wish that we would just do something once and for all to help EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST these people from such EMODISGUSTFEARNEGATIVESADNESS . i EMOSURPRISE in the mean EMOANTICIPATION all that i can do personally is just pray for the people though and hope that soon things will get better , somehow . does n't this just make you so mad ?
i just read this article about a murder EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS . this couple , their three kids , and their dog were all dead from gunshot wounds . they even shot the dog . :( the family seemed really normal . they had some issues with EMONEGATIVE and the relationship , but who does n't ? it 's really eerie that people can be like that and you wo n't even know it .
hello ! i just read this article and would like to EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST it with you . it is about the EMOPOSITIVE trees dying along the west EMOPOSITIVE . i know you are interested and we 've talked about this before . it seems to be caused by beetles and they are multiplying faster because of warm temperatures . i wish there was something more we were doing to stop climate EMOFEAR and these warm temps !
the growing back and forth EMOANGER between the EMOPOSITIVETRUST states and russia is really worrisome . one minute it seems like they like us and the next they have nuclear weapons at the EMOANTICIPATION and pointed straight at the EMOPOSITIVETRUST states . it 's scary to think about what could EMOANTICIPATION especially with the big mouthed EMOPOSITIVETRUST we have .
seems like a EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST ordinary occurrence . i 'm sure their families are EMOANGERNEGATIVESADNESS but i 'm less sure this EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST of story deserves space in a newspaper . a couple people got EMODISGUSTNEGATIVESADNESS and they died . anyway , it 's a mildly sad story but it 's not noteworthy or newsworthy . i do n't understand why stories like this run in the paper .
" i just read this article about the nodal protest movement that had a EMOANGERDISGUSTNEGATIVE headline . it is like they want people to have a EMONEGATIVESADNESS opinion about this issue , so they subtly frame it in a certain way . " " empty your EMOTRUST EMOTRUST " " to make a EMOPOSITIVE in support is a very EMONEGATIVESADNESS way of putting things , almost like psychological priming . anyway , i wonder how the pipeline protest movement is going to EMOANTICIPATIONPOSITIVETRUST under EMOSURPRISE . "
i ca n't believe that this place was ever given a license to carry out their business in the first place . these poor dogs died a slow painful death because the owners of this EMOSADNESS were so careless . did they not see the dogs EMODISGUSTFEARNEGATIVESADNESS ? how would they like to be locked up in a room in those temps ? make sure you are taking your pets to a EMOPOSITIVETRUST EMOSADNESS if you do need to EMOANTICIPATION them - i would have to see something like this EMOANTICIPATION to anyone else ! !
hello , i have to tell you something EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST , i have some EMOANTICIPATIONPOSITIVESURPRISE about an article that i read recently , said that donald EMOSURPRISE was elected EMOPOSITIVETRUST of the EMOPOSITIVETRUST states . the next day , a man discovered that someone had painted swastikas in an EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS EMOANTICIPATIONPOSITIVE in south philadelphia , i was hoping that this type of EMOPOSITIVE could be in the article
honestly it seems that the world is and has been EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST a place for many refugees from all over for some EMOANTICIPATION . i find it EMOANGERNEGATIVE that despite the people from africa and the middle east being evacuated from there previous EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS situations they still feel the need to EMOANGERANTICIPATIONFEARNEGATIVE EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVE and cause EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS and EMOTRUST not only ungratefulness , but barbarity .
e rate EMOFEARNEGATIVE funding program across country to connect the EMOTRUST from internet and it hits the EMOANGER buttons of education , EMOPOSITIVE , and good jobs at good EMOJOYPOSITIVE in one shot and spreads federal monies to vendors and consultants in every corner of the country . students EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST in 2013 bring up the funding 2.3 billions EMOTRUST to 4 billions .
i think we need to remember a few EMOPOSITIVETRUST things , psychologists and psychiatrists have very hard times . sometimes the people they are sent to treat are manipulative to a point they have fooled family , friends and professionals for years . we also have to acknowledge those with underlying mental health issues who may have been taken EMOPOSITIVE of and used by EMOANGERDISGUSTFEARNEGATIVE organizations .
" that was the strangest article i 've ever read - i 'm not sure why i read it . was it an EMONEGATIVESADNESS ? art/ ? it just said something like " " article EMOPOSITIVETRUST - article - article source - date . " " i 'm not sure how to emotionally EMOANGERFEAR to such a thing since it had no emotional EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST whatsoever , no biographical EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST , no factual EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST , no EMOPOSITIVETRUST EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST at all . seriously , i believe there is a malfunction in the survey . "
i just read about a company is EMOANGERDISGUSTFEARNEGATIVE one of the largest populations of orangutan 's in indonesia by chopping down a critical forest to EMOPOSITIVE it to a tree plantation . i think it 's really EMOANGERDISGUSTFEARNEGATIVE that indonesia knows they need to EMOPOSITIVE their EMOPOSITIVE and EMONEGATIVESURPRISE life but still allows things like this to EMOANTICIPATION .
it is really EMONEGATIVESADNESS to read about these immigrants from this article who drowned . it makes me feel EMOANTICIPATIONFEARNEGATIVE and EMOANGERNEGATIVESADNESS how the whole EMOANGERNEGATIVESURPRISE happened . it is a terrible occurrence that this had to EMOANTICIPATION at the EMOPOSITIVE EMOPOSITIVE . thankfully there were some survivors . the EMOTRUST that babies were EMONEGATIVESADNESS makes it that much more emotional to read all of this
i EMOANTICIPATION the article was quite sad to read and EMONEGATIVESADNESS to hear about the iraqi people . i felt sad for them EMOPOSITIVE their future was uncertain and how hard it was to find a EMOPOSITIVE . the EMOTRUST they deal with is much EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS than ours and i can only imagine how EMOFEAR it must be living there . i hope that it gets better in the future .
it 's really amazing to me how much EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST we EMODISGUSTNEGATIVE as a country considering how overweight and EMODISGUSTNEGATIVE people are . i ca n't believe how EMOANGERDISGUSTNEGATIVESADNESS it all is , if you think about it . a lot of the EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST we EMOPOSITIVE , we do n't need , and then we throw away so much too ! all that EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST belongs with people who really need it . i wish people would donate more and that restaurants could donate their unused EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST to homeless shelters .
i 've heard of narcotizing fascistic before . it 's really fucking scary to think that just from a tiny little cut you could get a disease that has a high likelihood of EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS you . there 's also a similar EMODISGUSTFEARNEGATIVESADNESS called spenglerian fowler that can get into your body from water going up your nostrils and it basically eats your brain . nature is fucking metal .
i totally support these protesters . we 've had trouble with oil pipelines here in michigan . i feel like these pipelines are foisted on local communities without any care for whether it is good for the EMOPOSITIVE and without adequate studies as to how EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST they are from leaks and EMODISGUSTNEGATIVE . there are more EMOPOSITIVETRUST things in life than money and oil .
this EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVE is a good example of how EMONEGATIVESADNESS people and people w are EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS prosecuted by the EMOFEARPOSITIVETRUST . now in this articles this gentlemen is getting a re - trial since they concur that he did n't do such thing and basically had the EMOFEARPOSITIVETRUST EMOANGERDISGUSTNEGATIVE to the judge . now he can be EMOPOSITIVETRUST be judged and not be discriminated
i feel for her . they could’t EMOPOSITIVE to cremate them on their own and help them , and the financial help they were entitled to as EMOANGERNEGATIVE victims had not come through because the EMOTRUST today is n't going to help criminals . i hope the EMOFEARNEGATIVE now helps criminals through EMOFEARNEGATIVE activities and make the world a better place
so , i had to read an article about somebody named kyle jenner , and evidently she has some sort of makeup line or something . anyway , evidently she must be popular for some EMOPOSITIVE , because people are making counterfeit cosmetics and selling them as her brand . she put out some message about how you should only buy direct from her website . i EMOSURPRISE a EMOANGERNEGATIVE is born every minute .
i just read about a EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVESURPRISE male wolf that was shot dead after walking 700 miles in search of a EMOPOSITIVETRUST . that seems EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST awful . i am thinking about all of the different paths that wolf walked along on his EMOANTICIPATIONFEARJOYPOSITIVE , only to see it end in disaster . apparently it was a EMOFEARNEGATIVE sniper that killed him . i 'm not sure why the EMOFEARNEGATIVE has snipers to EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS wolves . if they are posing a direct EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVE , then of course animals must be killed , but i do n't see that this wolf was EMOANGERDISGUSTFEARNEGATIVE anyway . it seems dishonorable .
can you believe what this family has done to these girls ? they have treated these children so heinously . it is EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVE that the EMOFEARPOSITIVETRUST would n't do anything until they were basically EMOFEARNEGATIVE by the media . i can appreciate things that happened later to help these girls but this so EMOANGERDISGUSTNEGATIVESADNESS . this breaks my heart .
so today i read about vaughn , an actor i did n't really know his name but have watched or heard most of the shows and movies he has been in . today , i heard , he died at age 83 due to EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS . it is very sad to lose such a well respected actor . i EMOSURPRISE his parents divorced at a EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVESURPRISE age but both gave him the genes to act .
it does seem silly that people in EMOPOSITIVETRUST relationships are still affected by the donating EMONEGATIVE , but i can also understand why such a EMONEGATIVE was put in place . the trouble with anything is that when you try to EMOPOSITIVE some people , others rights seem to always be infringed and we 're EMOFEARNEGATIVE to decide which offense is EMOPOSITIVE and more EMOPOSITIVETRUST . i do n't see why someone ca n't be tested , EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST to be EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST and then give blood but i can understand why especially in an EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESSSURPRISE when things can easily get overlooked the EMONEGATIVE is a good idea .
EMOPOSITIVE this was infuriating to me . to see such casual EMONEGATIVE for life , both of the animals and those EMOPOSITIVETRUST them , in pursuit of money . and for what ? EMODISGUSTFEARNEGATIVE oil cures in asia , EMOANTICIPATIONFEARNEGATIVE EMONEGATIVE , and rich people EMONEGATIVESADNESS to feel powerful . the security teams seem like they 're in an EMONEGATIVESADNESS position , EMOFEAR by rules while their opponents have none . it 's a EMOANGERDISGUSTNEGATIVESADNESS situation
this is EMODISGUSTFEARNEGATIVESADNESS . you 're just going about your business , then someone takes issue with you , and EMOSURPRISE you 're dead . maybe you did n't even interact with them and they just decided to EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS you for EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVE . it 's deeply troubling and makes you EMOANGERANTICIPATIONNEGATIVE of every EMOFEARNEGATIVE on the street . i also feel bad for those who had to EMOTRUST this and did n't have EMOANTICIPATION to do anything to stop it . i 'd imagine some feel EMOANGERNEGATIVESADNESS even though they could n't have helped .
i have EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST strong thoughts and feelings about this . from what i read , i feel like that is a very EMONEGATIVE situation . us as a society , we are taking EMOPOSITIVE of the trees we have here . in order to EMOPOSITIVE the environment and make the environment better again , we need to take care of it . what we are doing , in my opinion , is morally and ethnically EMONEGATIVE and we need to do a better EMOPOSITIVE of taking care of nature . i understand that some EMOANGERDISGUSTNEGATIVE is from the volcanoes of hawaii , but feel like us humans do way more EMOANGERDISGUSTNEGATIVESADNESS than what mother nature brings .
awful news article . us as a society need to do a better EMOPOSITIVE of EMOPOSITIVETRUST and helping not only our planet , but the animals and mammals that EMOANTICIPATIONNEGATIVEPOSITIVE it . the EMOTRUST that almost 100 percent of the caimans are suspected to be dead is EMOFEARNEGATIVESURPRISE and people should be more informed on such matters . the rate of extinction that these animals and mammals are going through on our planet is extremely EMOFEARNEGATIVESURPRISE and i can not figure out why people are n't more EMOFEARSADNESS or even aware of the matter . we need to do a better EMOPOSITIVE of EMOPOSITIVETRUST all living matter on this planet , not just ourselves .
we should all try to do more to EMONEGATIVE global warming for the sake the polar EMOANGERFEAR EMOPOSITIVE and for our own human EMOPOSITIVE as well . please read this article about the polar bears and the problems they face and issues that they must EMOPOSITIVE EMOTRUST to global warming . the article is very EMOPOSITIVE and explains the issues very well . it is EMOPOSITIVE EMOPOSITIVE and sharing with others to bring exposure to the plight of the polar bears .
wow , how EMOANTICIPATIONTRUST this person EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS a poor flamingo for no EMOPOSITIVE ! ? why would some random dude go to busch gardens and abuse a bird who was minding its own business ? poor bird had to be euthanize because of its injuries ! the bird was 19 years old ! it seems that there may have to be some sort of background check or mental health testing before you are even allowed to EMOPOSITIVE a place like this . just EMONEGATIVE the way things EMOANTICIPATION ! EMODISGUSTNEGATIVE sad !
oh my goodness , check out this article . very EMOPOSITIVE but also very sad . poor guy was just trying to do his EMOPOSITIVE . this sounds like a terrible way to EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS . if nothing else maybe some new and EMOPOSITIVE safety measures will be put in place to EMOPOSITIVE the next person who has this same recycling EMOPOSITIVE . i hope his family gets an EMOANGERFEARPOSITIVETRUST and tries to get some sort of money for his EMONEGATIVE death .
read this article , this happened in georgia where i live so i saw massive amounts of news coverage EMOTRUST to this EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS . i personally believe that the guy is EMOANGERNEGATIVESADNESS , there are too many things that he did and said that did not add up . it seems that he wanted to get rid of his kid and EMONEGATIVESADNESSSURPRISE his wife and live his free lifestyle . i do not see any possible way that he did not know that the kid was in the car . that poor kid !
i do n't necessarily EMOPOSITIVE with this stance , as i feel EMOSURPRISE can help our country move forth and EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST economically . while EMOSURPRISE was n't my ideal EMOPOSITIVETRUST , he was the much better EMOPOSITIVE over clinton . so , in my opinion , he was the better EMOPOSITIVE . i feel like obama was a EMONEGATIVE as a EMOPOSITIVETRUST , and what did he really do during his 8 years of presidency that he will be remembered for ? obama care ? that is n't a positive in my opinion . so , i ca n't say that i really think moore and i are on the same page , and we have a difference of opinions .
as a woman myself , i really EMOSADNESS with these women . while i find it very EMOFEAR to imagine what they go through as a woman , i can get some EMONEGATIVE idea . i would hate to think that i had to have a male EMOTRUST when i left my home . they are n't treated as equals , and often men do n't even consider them equal as their family EMONEGATIVE ! < many of the women can be abused , physically and sexually , and they are considered to be the EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS , not the abuser ! i hope they are able to win by the petition , and will be able to have a bit more EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST !
there was a terrible bus EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESSSURPRISE near the town where i grew up . it looks like a EMONEGATIVESADNESS sedan EMOANGERNEGATIVE the bus and people were EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS . apparently the EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS people were taken to a nearby hospital where i used to work . no EMOPOSITIVETRUST was released on the condition of the individuals but i sure hope it was no one we know or that no one is seriously EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS . please say a prayer for all involved and be EMOPOSITIVE that no lives were EMONEGATIVESADNESS .
i do n't know much about cricket but apparently in england it 's a very big deal ! this one town 's EMOTRUST is under the EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVE to win the championship and needs only 33 more points to EMOPOSITIVE it off . can you imagine the EMONEGATIVE of the EMOTRUST and players ? ? ? that must be some EMOANGERDISGUSTFEARNEGATIVE EMOANTICIPATIONNEGATIVE over there . i wonder if they have as big of a fan EMOTRUST as most of our sports do here in the states ?
all the EMOFEARSADNESS in the middle east has me really EMOFEARSADNESS with my son being deployed over there . there 's so much going on in saudi arabia and neighboring countries and i 'm so EMONEGATIVESADNESS he will end up right in the middle of it all . please say a prayer that he is EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST over there and that nothing bad happens while he is there !
again , i would n't EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST this with anyone ; it 's not that EMOPOSITIVE to me or to the people that i know . have you seen this article about the EMOSURPRISE rise in tiger murders by poachers ? it 's EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST shitty that this still goes on , but what can you do ? people are going to be EMOANGERDISGUSTFEARNEGATIVE for all kinds of reasons and nothing is going to EMOFEAR . what do you think about it ? did you think that this was an EMOPOSITIVE article ? what 's your thoughts ?
i am really saddened by what is happening in brazil . i ca n't stand that this type of EMOANGERDISGUSTNEGATIVESADNESS is happening in nature . we as citizens of the world really have to step up our efforts so that it does n't EMOANTICIPATION more often . we should little by little try to reverse the EMOANGERDISGUSTNEGATIVESADNESS that has been done for better good .
dude i seriously can not believe what happened at the zoo not too EMOANTICIPATION ago . a kid EMONEGATIVESADNESS into a EMOTRUST in may when he EMONEGATIVESADNESS through the EMOANGERNEGATIVE . wow it must have been so terrifying for the family . then the EMONEGATIVE picked up the EMODISGUSTNEGATIVE and carried him a little bit . they actually ended up EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVE the EMONEGATIVE which is so sad .
natural disasters like these are just so scary . they could literally EMOANTICIPATION at anytime and no one ever knows when , especially earthquakes . it is sad to see such historic buildings and areas be EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS by this event . it is even more sad EMOPOSITIVE that people got EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS . some things just are n't EMOPOSITIVE in life and you never see it EMOANTICIPATION .
this is so EMONEGATIVESADNESS for the family of this EMOTRUST and son . they were probably just trying to have a nice together , but did not research the area well enough or did not EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST EMOPOSITIVE EMOPOSITIVE . there are so many things that could go EMONEGATIVE , and in this EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS , they all seemed to have gone EMONEGATIVE . i feel bad for them . the world can be EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST EMOANGERNEGATIVESADNESS .
i feel like we need to do something about this EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS that is going on we font need moms overdosing on drugs plus doing it while they are driving . maybe there is a program we could EMOANTICIPATION to help these mom in need and the kids that they have should be taken care by someone else while they are getting the help that they need to get better and then they can get there kids back when they are able to take care of them
how could someone treat such an EMOPOSITIVETRUST EMODISGUSTFEARNEGATIVE so EMONEGATIVE . you 'd think by now people would figure out that we do n't have any EMOPOSITIVE right to health and EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVE over other animals on earth . you 'd think people would be too EMODISGUSTNEGATIVESADNESS of the EMOSURPRISE of getting caught acting like this to actually have the EMONEGATIVE to treat another living EMODISGUSTFEARNEGATIVE so despicably .
hi mike , i hope you are . it 's been hard to have these days over there when you need me here , my EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST . i hope that you are taking care of all the dangers that you are going through , that you do it for us , for your people , your country but leaving aside all that you must EMOJOYPOSITIVESURPRISETRUST in you and your family that are waiting for you here i hope you are well and can see you soon mike
hello EMOPOSITIVETRUST i hope you are well these days and EMOANTICIPATION a lot about you and more when i see the news i find out that saudi arabia is struggling to expand its territory no matter what this EMOPOSITIVE should take care of being there is very EMOFEARNEGATIVE so be EMOPOSITIVE i hope you take care of yourself and think of us
man veterans need more help . this article talks about how a lot of americans have problems , especially vets , with sleeping . i can imagine that this sleeping EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS can carry over into so many other areas of their lives like at work and their interpersonal relationships . even EMOANTICIPATION they were n't able to EMOTRUST a specific link their has to be a link between potsdam and problems with sleeping given the huge consequences of potsdam .
getting old is sad . i hope they EMOPOSITIVE through . but , many people never reach 86 . so , i ca n't feel too bad for them . they also probably lived a life many of us can only dream about . this might sound EMONEGATIVE , but i will probably EMONEGATIVE about this in 5 minutes . life goes on . i 've already EMONEGATIVE more EMOANTICIPATION thinking about them than they will ever think about me .
this is a terrible story , but we ca n't go so far as to EMOANGERDISGUSTNEGATIVE an entire EMOTRUST for the actions of some . we hope what happened to paris never happens again , but we simply need a bit more security and people with their eyes open - not attitudes against an entire EMOTRUST or people . consider these EMONEGATIVESADNESS ways of rallying countries behind one cause of EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST .
this is a nice story - people have some EMOPOSITIVETRUST of need to EMOPOSITIVE nature and EMOPOSITIVETRUST birds is an EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST way of EMOPOSITIVE back , especially since some are EMOFEARNEGATIVE . i have to EMOPOSITIVE this person for trying really hard to EMOPOSITIVE one species , and for committing to it . i myself would have a EMOFEAR EMOANTICIPATION choosing what to gel EMOPOSITIVETRUST - but this person does n't !
i just do n't understand how this is the country that we all say we EMOJOYPOSITIVE and EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST , but yet when others come here there are so many stipulations for them , and then even when they succeed at jumping through all of the hoops they are EMOFEARNEGATIVE to , they have even more guidelines behind that . it 's just so EMONEGATIVESADNESS that these refugees will feel EMOFEARNEGATIVE and EMOANTICIPATIONPOSITIVE feel like refugees for the EMOPOSITIVE of their lives .
these are the headlines that i have to read these days ! i just ca n't believe all of the horrid news that is taking over our lives lately . and now we have to EMOANTICIPATIONFEARNEGATIVESADNESS about when our men and women go out to train , that this EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST of thing can end of happening at the drop of a hat . so , who is EMOPOSITIVETRUST after this ? who helps the children now without parents ? who pays for everything surrounding their funerals , and all of the costs after that ?
the wildlife park offers their help after over half a million supporters signed a petition made by the non - profit organization animals asia to EMOANGERNEGATIVE the EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVESADNESS of the aquarium . if the current owners of the polar EMOANGERFEAR EMOPOSITIVE to this EMOPOSITIVE , pizza could be moved to a EMOPOSITIVE EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST and his life of misery would end . “ the good news now for grand view is that they now have the EMOSURPRISE to put their EMONEGATIVESADNESS right , ” dave neal , animal welfare EMOPOSITIVETRUST for animals asia , said in a EMOPOSITIVETRUST . “ thanks to this incredible EMOPOSITIVE from yorkshire wildlife park there can be a EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST ending and the EMONEGATIVESADNESS publicity they have suffered can yet be turned into a positive news story . from talking to them i know they know that mistakes have been made in terms of their animal facilities and on - going care . ” china ’s
i feel that it is a common thing to have intentions EMONEGATIVE . the article seems to discuss what the difference is between perception EMOANGERNEGATIVE reality . i EMOJOYPOSITIVE to understand what part of reality i can dissect to understand how i can do better myself . for example if a family member tells me that something does not look right on my body i usually take it off . for example i had a bad weave on my head one EMOANTICIPATION and i took it off after EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST and never wore it again . i EMOJOYPOSITIVE to always look my best and if i do n't i will usually correct the situation . the perception of fantasy is often when people get in trouble because they EMOPOSITIVETRUST it as reality . i have always EMOPOSITIVE constructive EMOANGERNEGATIVESADNESS from my parents so that i can also distinguish the difference as well . parents should often be the EMONEGATIVE ok .
there is a particularly rough situation with the EMOPOSITIVETRUST states , russia , and syria right now . the EMOPOSITIVETRUST states is EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVESURPRISE EMONEGATIVE EMOFEARJOYPOSITIVETRUST about attacks and conspiracies . there is a need for EMOPOSITIVETRUST but EMOPOSITIVETRUST intensity is very EMOPOSITIVETRUST . russia seems to be keeping its EMOFEARJOYPOSITIVETRUST under wraps while syria is in a power EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESSSURPRISE .
there are many orphaned children around the world . international displacement is a huge EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS that seems to be causing a lot of separated families . these children are having to go to orphanages , shelters , and other temporary placement in order to EMOANTICIPATION refuge . these children range in age from EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVESURPRISE to teenagers .
details and EMOPOSITIVE about the past is used to make decisions , as past experiences of feelings EMONEGATIVEPOSITIVE current decision - making , how people will feel in the future , and if they want to feel that way again . gilbert and wilson conducted a EMOPOSITIVE to EMOTRUST how EMOJOYPOSITIVE a person would feel if they purchased flowers for themselves for no specific EMOPOSITIVE ( EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVESURPRISE , anniversary , or EMOPOSITIVE etc . ) and how EMOANTICIPATION they EMOANTICIPATION that feeling would last . people who had no experience of purchasing flowers for themselves and those who had EMOPOSITIVETRUST buying flowers for themselves were tested . results showed that those who had purchased flowers in the past for themselves felt happier and that feeling lasted longer for them than for a person who had never EMOPOSITIVETRUST purchasing flowers for themselves
a EMODISGUST feeling , or EMODISGUST reaction , is a visceral emotional reaction to something . it may be EMONEGATIVESADNESS , such as a feeling of EMOANTICIPATIONNEGATIVESADNESS , or positive , such as a feeling of EMOTRUST . EMODISGUST feelings are generally regarded as not modulated by conscious EMOANTICIPATION , but sometimes as a EMOPOSITIVE of EMOPOSITIVETRUST rather than rationality .
feelings are deemed appropriate if they fit the current situation . since individuals want to fit in and be seen as normal , they are EMOTRUST EMOPOSITIVE on their feelings in order to fit the situation . emotion work is more so how people want to feel or how they want other people to see them feel . feelings are not permanent , but an EMOANTICIPATION thing because people EMOTRUST try to bring up , EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS , or EMOPOSITIVETRUST feelings
i just read another story about american soldiers deaths at the hands of terrorists . what upsets me the most about EMOPOSITIVE it is thinking about their families . i wonder if they had children that will have to EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST up without them . i think about wives and their parents and how those peoples ' lives have now changed forever . i think about how EMOANGERNEGATIVESADNESS i would be if my son grew up to EMOPOSITIVE the EMOFEAR . i would be a EMODISGUSTNEGATIVE .
i just read an article about EMODISGUSTFEARNEGATIVESADNESS EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST in squirrels . it is EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST of scary to think about what diseases can be EMONEGATIVE in other animals that we are not even aware of . i EMOANTICIPATIONFEARNEGATIVESADNESS enough about this EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST of stuff as it is , and now i just have more to EMOANTICIPATIONFEARNEGATIVESADNESS about when i EMONEGATIVESADNESSSURPRISE the house . sometimes i think that EMONEGATIVE is EMOJOYPOSITIVE . it makes me want to just stay inside .
" i just read an article that outlines what obama did to help the " " poor " " compared to what EMOSURPRISE wants to do to take these things away . obviously , the poor are going to have a much harder EMOANTICIPATION under EMOSURPRISE 's administration . i think it goes without saying that i hate this guy and i ca n't believe he is our EMOPOSITIVETRUST . i am counting the days til the next presidential election . if these idiots vote for him again , well , i wo n't believe it . although , i did n't believe he would be voted in in the first place either . it is just sad that our country is taking ten steps way way back voting in this guy . "
" clearly , this was an opinion piece . it is upsetting that so many try to pass off an opinion piece as a news article these days . that is exactly what EMONEGATIVE news is . the EMOPOSITIVE was n't even trying to EMOFEAR it . she EMOPOSITIVE " " hhhhhhmmmmmmm , hhhmmmm , hhhmmmm " " as part of her article . mfa . that is when there was not longer any EMOPOSITIVE to take it seriously anymore . sure , some of the info in there may be EMOPOSITIVETRUST , but the EMOANGERNEGATIVE overwhelms all . "
oh , please . it is getting EMOANGER - climate EMOFEAR . it is getting EMONEGATIVE - climate EMOFEAR . there is a EMOFEAR - climate EMOFEAR . EMONEGATIVE that EMOTRUST that the climate has changed since the EMONEGATIVE of EMOANTICIPATION , and that people throw cigarettes out the window all the EMOANTICIPATION too . these EMOFEAR little articles are also EMOJOYPOSITIVE and upsetting at the same EMOANTICIPATION .
" the article says that- EMOSURPRISE to supporters EMOANGER minorities : ' stop it ' — donald EMOSURPRISE on sunday told his supporters to stop EMOANGER minorities , in his first televised sit - down interview since becoming EMOPOSITIVETRUST - EMOPOSITIVETRUST . " " i am so saddened to hear that , " " EMOSURPRISE told cbs ' lesley stael on " " 60 minutes " " when she said latinos and muslims are facing harassment . " " and i say , ' stop it . ' if it -- if it helps , i will say this , and i will say right to the cameras : ' stop it . ' " " EMOSURPRISE directed his comments to his own supporters whom said have written racist slogans or chanted EMODISGUSTFEARNEGATIVESADNESS messages -- particularly in schools . it was a powerful EMOANTICIPATION to a EMOTRUST ripped apart by the divisive 2016 campaign . EMOSURPRISE 's election has left democrats EMOANGERDISGUSTNEGATIVE and many minorities EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS about the future . "
" hello , how have you been lately ? i am curious about an article i read recently , said that an instagram publication of a mother reached almost 400 " " likes " " in her EMOTRUST and more than 800 " " likes " " in the EMOTRUST of the 4ht quarter of the bodies project . birth without EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVE also published his photo on facebook , where he reached more than 6,000 likes . , i realized that the article had a EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS that interested me more , because of the events that were happening in this one . "
i 've given up my EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST in EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST . there are just certain events that transpire that make you EMOFEARNEGATIVE to the EMOPOSITIVE . after EMOPOSITIVE multiple articles today about just how shitty people can be to one another , it makes me beyond EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST to know the individuals that are in my own EMOTRUST life . human EMOANGERDISGUSTNEGATIVE knows no bounds . human ego needs to be set aside and/or EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS .
i just read about an old couple that died while out in the water . apparently they may have had some EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST of health conditions , but nobody really knows . the people who checked the bodies think it was probably heart attacks that killed them . anyway , it 's really scary to think that at any given moment our hearts can just stop EMOPOSITIVE and then we are gone forever .
" he EMOPOSITIVE was on duster 's list of local officials branded as " " narc - politicians " " who allegedly have ties to the illegal drug world , according to cnn affiliate cnn philippines . he , along with his wife , surrendered themselves to provincial EMOFEARPOSITIVETRUST in EMOPOSITIVE to clear their names and EMOANGERNEGATIVE EMOANGER . at the roadblock early friday morning , an " " EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVEPOSITIVE encounter " " between dimaggio 's men and EMOFEARPOSITIVETRUST ensued , the report says , with EMOTRUST EMONEGATIVE officials responding to EMOFEAR from the EMOPOSITIVE 's bodyguards , leaving 10 men dead . duster was elected to office in may on a platform of a hardliner crackdown on EMOANGERNEGATIVE , particularly illegal drugs . since taking office in early june , his EMOFEARPOSITIVETRUST EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVE has waged a bloody EMOFEARNEGATIVE on drug dealers and users , resulting in the deaths of hundreds of filipino drug suspects at the "

" look at this EMONEGATIVE . we can put dudes on the moon and video chat across the planet with anyone we like , but we still ca n't make containers for fuel that do n't EMONEGATIVE everywhere ? you know that " " cu EMOPOSITIVE " " thing i told you about ? at this point i think someone ( probably the environments ) EMOPOSITIVE from this enough to keep doing it . how about we EMOPOSITIVE pipelines for the oil ? oh right , environments again , complete with the EMODISGUSTNEGATIVESADNESS heap they left behind after their protest . "
ha . get him , EMODISGUSTFEARNEGATIVE ! i 'm so EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST of that EMODISGUSTFEARNEGATIVE . if you do n't want to be crushed by an EMOANGERDISGUSTNEGATIVE python , maybe do n't use the poor thing to do tricks for people . i mean , EMOANGERDISGUSTFEARNEGATIVE the warm thing until it stops moving is EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST of what EMOFEAR snakes do . i hope they did n't EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS the EMODISGUSTFEARNEGATIVE , poor EMOJOYPOSITIVE . she was just EMOPOSITIVE herself , basically .
the earthquake was terrible . thankfully , they did n't have EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS people , just EMOFEARNEGATIVESURPRISE ones . as bad as the situation is , it could have been EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS . while people have no homes , they have their lives and the lives of their loved ones . it is terrible these people do n't have a particularly EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST place to stay right now , and the EMOANTICIPATION of EMOANGERNEGATIVESADNESS everything you own is catastrophic . but , you can rebuild your life with your family .
i can not EMOANGERDISGUSTNEGATIVE people for leaving . living in an area that is prone to natural disasters , like an area that is below EMOPOSITIVE EMOPOSITIVETRUST and near a EMOPOSITIVE , is a bad idea . it is bad for the EMOFEARNEGATIVE of louisiana , but you ca n't EMOANGERDISGUSTNEGATIVE these people for getting out . and , of course , there is nothing that they can do to stop them .
hello EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST , i was EMOFEARNEGATIVE EMOPOSITIVE the article about the bankruptcy of american apparel . however , it is clear that there were so many problems with the company , EMOPOSITIVE the ceo , that the company has been EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS for a while . it 's a EMODISGUSTFEARNEGATIVESADNESS the company was so EMONEGATIVE mismanaged . maybe if they had a different ceo , they would have been able to EMOPOSITIVE .
hello EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST , this article cracks me up . as someone who hates EMOSURPRISE , i think it 's EMOJOYPOSITIVESURPRISE . realistically , the mother EMOPOSITIVETRUST just talked to her son about the reasons she dislikes EMOSURPRISE . trying to EMOANTICIPATIONPOSITIVETRUST him that EMOSURPRISE is a immoral person would 've been a better use of her EMOANTICIPATION . what makes me mad though , is that people called cps on her . people always trying to get involved in everybody 's business .
this is a very sad article . being of of the first EMOPOSITIVE fighter pilots must have given her and her family great EMOPOSITIVETRUST . i think that there should be more training for all pilots who deal in these acrobatic EMOFEARPOSITIVE routines . i also think that women have just as much of a right to become a fighter EMOPOSITIVETRUST as men .
it must be extremely EMOFEAR to find these EMOSADNESS wolf terrorist . i can only begin to understand the type of manpower needed to pursue these people . i think that most of them are mentally ill and hard to EMOSURPRISE before they commit the EMOANGERNEGATIVE . it makes me think of the movie EMONEGATIVE report and how that type of EMOPOSITIVE might become available with the advance of a.i ..
this is sad and such a strange EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS . i do n't know who to side on . while it would have been good to stop the boat to look it also might not have mattered depending on where he EMONEGATIVESADNESS into the water . i do n't really care about them being gay or the EMOTRUST that they say they were harassed that should n't matter in the EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS anyway .
this is so disturbing . it says that they are EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS chickens that are still awake during it . it 's like they like torturing them . why ca n't we be like europe ? in europe they have rules on how this is supposed to be done . no we just let companies do whatever they like . how hard it is to EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS something and make sure it 's not awake while doing so ?
those poor families in the middle east . near the city of yemen . i EMOSURPRISE so much EMOANGERNEGATIVE over there has led to really EMODISGUSTFEARNEGATIVESADNESS living conditions . they are having new suspected cases of EMODISGUSTFEARNEGATIVESADNESS all the EMOANTICIPATION , and most of those ill are EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVESURPRISE kids . i ca n't even imagine such bad living conditions . these kids deserve a better life . not EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVE and EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS .
the article was about smokers and the prevalence of cancer among EMONEGATIVE smokers . it indicated that the EMONEGATIVE lobby results in weak EMONEGATIVE control and a low EMOPOSITIVE among politicians to try and stop people from smoking . quite frankly , i 'm not sure why i should care about smokers . the evidence is there for them to see , yet they persist in their bad habits . EMOFEARNEGATIVE can only do so much and it makes little EMOPOSITIVE for me to EMOANTICIPATIONFEARNEGATIVESADNESS about another person 's health when they are consciously making the decision to EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS themselves .
i did not know much about cohen before i read the article about his death . i heard the jeff buckley song of course because it appears in shrek . i also think that the irish girl did a EMOTRUST of bird on a wire that i like . he did a lot of work and was an EMONEGATIVEPOSITIVE over much of the EMOJOYPOSITIVESADNESS scene . it was sad he got ripped off and had to work so hard to re - EMOPOSITIVE his fortune . it is an informative article and EMOPOSITIVE a read if you do n't know much about him .
i really am EMODISGUSTNEGATIVESADNESS of these pseudo scientists running around EMOANGERDISGUSTFEARNEGATIVE the EMOPOSITIVE is EMONEGATIVESADNESS . it is a load of EMODISGUSTNEGATIVE science . the take a snapshot of the earth , a vastly EMONEGATIVE EMOTRUST with millions of variables that is in EMOPOSITIVETRUST flux and EMOANTICIPATION . they plug this into a EMOPOSITIVE with a couple of hundred hand picked variables and pronounce that we are all EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS . it is bad science and everyone knows it .
another EMOFEARNEGATIVE and EMONEGATIVESADNESS article about EMOSURPRISE . not EMOSURPRISE , EMOPOSITIVE and EMOPOSITIVETRUST passed out of EMOTRUST EMOANTICIPATION ago . EMOSURPRISE is not against renewable power , he just wants a free market and he is right . the free market is the only way you will get renewable to the EMOPOSITIVE that they need to go global and push carbon out . if you coddle them they will get EMODISGUSTNEGATIVESADNESS and EMONEGATIVE and never move EMOPOSITIVE . the paris treaty was a push toward globalism and a EMOPOSITIVE for the liberals who dream of an EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST class ruling the world .
passing this article along to you ! remember how we were just discussing this ? i EMOSURPRISE there is enough EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESSTRUST now in the death of the EMOPOSITIVE former EMOPOSITIVETRUST that died in that plane EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESSSURPRISE that they now are exhuming the body . some people EMOFEARNEGATIVE that the russians actually poisoned him and the EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESSSURPRISE is a EMOTRUST up ! not everyone 's EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST about this though as it might seem disrespectful .
www , this story is so heartbreaking . i ca n't imagine what this family is going through . did you see this ? i am hopeful that they can find EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST . if something like this happened to me , i do not know what i would do . i EMOSURPRISE that this just reminds us that life is EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVESURPRISE and we should appreciate what we have !
please EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST your loved ones because they may be gone at any moments of EMOANTICIPATION . if you were in an EMOANGERNEGATIVE with any of them please reconsider what has happened in the past and let it go . life is short and we all have only one life to live on this planet . we should all cherish each other and EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST life to the fullest .
we should cherish all the works that the EMOFEARPOSITIVETRUST EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVE offers to us each and every day . while we sleep at night , EMOFEARPOSITIVETRUST officers EMOTRUST up and down our streets and neighborhoods making sure that we are EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST and sound . we may EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVE EMOFEARPOSITIVETRUST officers when we see them but EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVE not because they EMONEGATIVETRUST the country as our EMOTRUST and EMONEGATIVE .
this is very sad . i can only imagine how stressful it must be for the people living in the areas threatened by these fires . it must be so stressful EMOPOSITIVE that you have to be EMOANTICIPATION to EMOFEARNEGATIVE any minute and leaving your home and all your belongings behind to possibly never seeing them again . i also feel bad for all the wildlife .
i had never heard of people shaming women who give birth by c section . this is one of the dumbest things i 've ever heard . i 'm sure the EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST of c sections are medically required to help the mother and the EMOJOYPOSITIVE , not because women are just so eager to undergo EMOPOSITIVE EMOFEARSADNESS . why do people even care if someone gave birth by c section instead of natural birth anyway .
this is such a sad situation for both the people and the elephants affected by all the coal mining . the world really needs to move EMOPOSITIVE to try to replace using coal as a means of energy , and replace it with something that is less harmful to humans , animals and the environment . it 's not EMOPOSITIVE , especially to the animals , since they do n't really EMOPOSITIVE from the coal mining .
we definitely need to make sure we step up our efforts to vet who we let in this country , especially as far as refugees go . just like you would n't EMONEGATIVESADNESSSURPRISE your door open and invite intruders , we should not let refugees into our country without vetting them . we do n't know if they 're part of isis or not . it may seem like racial profiling , but only middle easterners belong to isis , so it is appropriate in this EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS .
EMOSURPRISE should really not EMOSURPRISE the blacks . they got complacent after two obama terms , and did n't come out in EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVE like they should have for the election . now that EMOSURPRISE is in office , i do n't think there 's any way he can win the EMONEGATIVESADNESS vote , and that would definitely sway the election in 2020 . i really think EMOSURPRISE 's days are numbered , whether it 's EMONEGATIVE or EMONEGATIVE in the next election .
did you hear about what had happened to the kid in china . they EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST his body dead in a deserted well in china after he was helping his EMOTRUST EMOPOSITIVE some vegetables or something like that . i just feel like if he was helping his EMOTRUST , then it is hard to believe that his dad did not know he had fallen into the well . either way , sad story .
so apparently there is an EMOANGERDISGUSTFEARNEGATIVE retired nba EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST who is going around and pieing EMOPOSITIVETRUST political figures aha . at first i EMOANTICIPATION it was a typo , and it was suppose to be EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS , but it indeed was talking about someone taking a coconut pie , and slamming it into the face of people . the act seems EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST EMOPOSITIVETRUST to me , and is almost sad that he is going to have to face some EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS EMOANTICIPATION along with the EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS from the security . obviously , you ca nt go around doing this , but it is EMONEGATIVESADNESS not to EMOJOYPOSITIVESURPRISE .
this day and age , there is a tremendous amount of evidence showing that climate EMOFEAR is EMOPOSITIVETRUST . in this new reality , how will life EMOANGERFEAR . do species have the EMOPOSITIVE to EMOPOSITIVE and thrive in new clients or will they EMOFEAR . what will EMOANTICIPATION to humans as well ? more studies need to be done in order to figure out not if we can stop climate EMOFEAR , but how will it affect us all .
EMODISGUSTNEGATIVESADNESS is an epidemic in today 's society . almost one in three people are EMODISGUSTNEGATIVE . sometimes i wonder how we got here . people these days take no responsibility for themselves and their actions . the cost of care has increased EMOPOSITIVE from the EMODISGUSTNEGATIVESADNESS epidemic in this country . according to the most current statistics , over fifteen million americans can be classified as extremely EMODISGUSTNEGATIVE .
not a surprise to see the EMOPOSITIVETRUST states EMONEGATIVESADNESS further down in the global rankings in yet another category . i think by the EMOANTICIPATION our next presidential election comes around we will be no longer be considered a destination country but anyone in the know . i do n't see why this particular stat is n't a matter of EMOPOSITIVE though . i have n't met many women who expressed an EMOPOSITIVE in stem and most of them did n't even want to EMOPOSITIVE to people who were into it when i was in college . now women might be more interested but it still is n't going to be anything EMOANTICIPATION equal because the EMOPOSITIVE does n't work that way .
" in spain this was the deadly train EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESSSURPRISE killed at least four people and EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS nearly 50 others after it derailed in the northwest region of the country . photos of the wreck showed the train ’s carriage flipped on its side and EMONEGATIVE from where it likely EMOANGERNEGATIVE part of a bridge near the tracks . a EMOTRUST woman told spanish television about EMOFEARNEGATIVE a " " very strong bang " " before seeing billowing EMONEGATIVESADNESS smoke . "
remember when i told you i had ringing in my ear sometimes ? this article seems to parallel what i was talking about . can you look into this further ? i really EMOTRUST your viewpoint on this . i am going to ask my EMOPOSITIVETRUST about this later on this week . i do not want this to get EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS . maybe you can EMOPOSITIVETRUST on a good EMOPOSITIVETRUST i can see regarding this ? i am just really EMONEGATIVESADNESS about it . thanks again man !
the flint , michigan water EMONEGATIVE is out of control . it seems like there is n't much being done to help them get cleaner water . we need to do everything we can to help them . children are being hospitalized because of the cities EMONEGATIVE . no one should have to go without EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST water , and because we live in the EMOPOSITIVETRUST states , it 's especially EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST .
i 'm sorry .... i do n't mean to EMOJOYPOSITIVESURPRISE ... but ..... this was too much . i hate to admit that i EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST it a little bit funny , but at the same EMOANTICIPATION , i feel sorry that this man was this EMODISGUSTNEGATIVE to do this to himself . now he 's going to have to go through so much more stuff , when in all likeliness , a simple urine test probably would have been performed to find a EMOPOSITIVE to the issue to begin with .
i just read the article and i am so EMOSURPRISE that this happened . i feel really embarrassed for her because it seems EMOPOSITIVETRUST that she 's the one starting trouble but i EMOANTICIPATIONFEARNEGATIVESADNESS that she might have some sort of mental EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS or EMOFEARNEGATIVE that she really did n't realize what she said and that makes me feel bad for her . i can understand her concerns about racism but i think that she 's just not very EMOPOSITIVETRUST in this EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS . i just feel like we need to be really sensitive towards racism and keep an open mind when it happens , but considering that there were other people there and absolutely no one is backing her up , i do n't know if we can really take her seriously and that 's really sad . crow also does n't seem like the EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST of person to be racist or to EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVE someone for absolutely no EMOPOSITIVE , either .
i always feel bad when women EMOPOSITIVE about their experiences with sexual EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVE because you know how i feel about that but i want to put it into EMOANGERNEGATIVE anyway . i feel like it 's always on the women to be the ones to hold men EMOPOSITIVETRUST and to report it and everything but i 'm so EMOANGERNEGATIVE by the EMOTRUST that men wo n't take a bigger stand . men should hold each other EMOPOSITIVETRUST for sexual EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVE and EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST each other not to do it instead of making jokes about it all the EMOANTICIPATION . i 'm just so EMOANGERNEGATIVE by how there are so many stories of women that are EMODISGUSTFEARNEGATIVESADNESS needlessly at the hands of these EMOANGERDISGUSTNEGATIVE men and yet women have to EMOPOSITIVE a lifetime of trauma from it and men usually get away with a EMOANGERNEGATIVESURPRISE on the wrist , it really just makes me so EMODISGUSTNEGATIVESADNESS to my EMODISGUST , i hate it so much .
it 's almost funny because i was looking at something really similar to this on steve wilkes , that a EMOJOYPOSITIVE got EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS after pushing through a window screen and steve was yelling at her and saying how she was so EMONEGATIVE and a bad mom but i honestly think that it 's not the parents EMONEGATIVESADNESS . sometimes accidents just really so EMOANTICIPATION and kids are curious and they climb and then accidents EMOANTICIPATION . it 's really upsetting for all of those involved and i really feel for the mom in this EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS because she just EMONEGATIVESADNESS her kid and she probably blames herself enough as it is . she does n't need society talking EMONEGATIVESADNESS about her from behind closed doors . accidents are just accidents and it can EMOANTICIPATION to anyone , although i think that everyone can EMOPOSITIVE that it 's a really sad situation overall .
hey EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST . did you hear about this EMODISGUSTNEGATIVE disease that is spreading among st the frog EMOPOSITIVE ? apparently it 's a disease that happens due to people having ponds in their house . i EMOANTICIPATIONFEARNEGATIVESADNESS what this disease could do to the local EMOPOSITIVE of frogs . tell anyone who has a pond to be EMOPOSITIVE with what they are moving in and out of their ponds .
i EMOANTICIPATION EMOPOSITIVE an article about iconic moments of women athletes would be quite a bit more EMOPOSITIVE and moving than it was . instead , it was mostly a rattling of championships and medal counts with very few anecdotal pieces of EMOPOSITIVE . the only things that really stood out were the story of the marathon runner and the swimmer because there were EMOPOSITIVE stories attached to them .
it 's very EMONEGATIVESADNESS for both the wildlife and the communities that EMOPOSITIVE off of the meat that the rare animals EMOPOSITIVETRUST . it 's also sad how the EMOFEARPOSITIVETRUST officers ran away which was i EMOSURPRISE the EMOPOSITIVE point of the person telling the story . that is very EMONEGATIVE and EMONEGATIVE , they should have stood up for the rangers being targeted . i think it 's best if the wildlife is preserved and the EMOPOSITIVE that attacked the rangers were clearly out of line .
hey , i EMOANTICIPATION this was an EMOPOSITIVE article about males born through EMOANTICIPATIONFEARPOSITIVETRUST fertilization . apparently , these men are also more likely to EMONEGATIVE from the same problems as their fathers did with being able to have babies . it 's sort of sad to think about it . the EMOPOSITIVETRUST EMOTRUST using a sperm donor instead , but i could n't imagine doing that if i was in this situation .
hey , check this out . this guy ended up murdering his wife for no EMOPOSITIVETRUST ad apparent EMOPOSITIVE , according to this article . he was EMOJOYPOSITIVE married to his wife and just ended up committing a homicide . it 's scary to think about , how it could be possible for someone to just go off like that and EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS someone they EMOJOYPOSITIVE .
this article i just read talks about another mass EMOFEAR . well , not so much mass EMOFEAR like some of the recent ones , but they did open EMOFEAR in EMOANTICIPATIONPOSITIVE and EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS 5 people . i ca n't help but feel disgusted that these things still EMOANTICIPATION . i really hope that this guy gets what he deserves , because this has to stop .
" ugh - can you believe this story ? first - why not just go to the EMOPOSITIVETRUST ? do n't be shy , it 's your dick we 're talking about . then , why insert a chopstick so far that you could""t get it out . EMOPOSITIVE EMODISGUSTNEGATIVE , that sounds awful . i am totally shocked to read this and can only imagine the EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS - but then again , he did bring it upon himself . "
did you see that leonard cohen passed away ? you know , the guy who made the hallelujah song . poor guy passed away after EMODISGUSTFEARNEGATIVESADNESS an EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS but from what i hear he passed away in his sleep and he did n't EMONEGATIVE at all which is really good . it really makes you think that if he would of went to the hospital he might actually still be EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST . just make sure you get yourself checked if you ever EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS yourself .
did you see what is going on with all those refugees ? they are trying to EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS over by water and a lot of them are drowning and there are record EMOPOSITIVE for deaths from shipwrecks . those poor people just want to get away and EMOPOSITIVE a better life and they all keep dying or EMOANTICIPATIONPOSITIVETRUST to EMONEGATIVE . i really wish we could do something for them so they could all live better lives .
wow - this is so so EMOANGERDISGUSTFEARNEGATIVE ! i ca n't even begin to understand why syria would EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVE its own citizens , and why would russia support them in doing so ? this is a EMODISGUSTNEGATIVESADNESS regime and i am EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVE that america and its allies are interfering . the EMOTRUST that they are EMOANTICIPATIONNEGATIVE doing it is truly messed up . i hope these poor children who survived are able to get the health care they so desperately EMOPOSITIVE . could you guys imagine if this was happening here ? ?
let 's be EMOPOSITIVETRUST for a second - EMOANGER is and always has been a cruel and nasty game . these politicians throw insults at each other for months in order to win . that 's what EMOANTICIPATIONNEGATIVE portrays itself as in EMOANGER . for this woman to EMOSURPRISE become EMOANGERNEGATIVESADNESS when she has thrown around plenty of insults herself is not just EMODISGUSTNEGATIVE , but also shows a lot of EMONEGATIVE on her part . i do n't like her policies anyways !
i really feel bad for turkey . i think they are trying to do everything they can to get rid of terrorism in the country . it seems that their efforts are for naught . they want to keep the people EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST and yet more terrorist groups keep popping up . then the lawmakers are involved and there is only so much you can do . turkey is EMOTRUST at EMOFEARNEGATIVE . i 'm wondering if this will end up with the us trying to do something over there or bringing that trouble here . it is upsetting really to hear about all this going on in the world when people just want EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST . there is always terrorism and someone trying to bring down a country , but the country tries its hardest to EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVE back despite EMOANGERNEGATIVE .
the article that i just read was about the EMOANTICIPATION EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS and EMOANGERNEGATIVE between kenya and south sudan . the EMOANGERNEGATIVE in the article really struck a EMOPOSITIVE with me . it made me EMONEGATIVESADNESS . there have been thousands of people who have EMONEGATIVESADNESS their lives during this EMOANGERNEGATIVE . it makes me want to reach out and help in any way possible . the EMOANGERNEGATIVE needs to stop and EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST needs to be restored between these two nations .
so i just read an article where 2 friends went diving to a place they should n't have and ended up dying . while they were using brand new equipment , i feel like idiots who take EMONEGATIVE risks and go to places where no humans should be , EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST of deserve what ends up happening to them . if you font EMOPOSITIVE dive , you never have to EMOANTICIPATIONFEARNEGATIVESADNESS about going splat when your chute does n't open
so when i was a kid , the big thing i used to remember was EMOPOSITIVE about the poachers in africa EMONEGATIVE down animal parts to then put into powder for men to EMOSADNESS to work like viagra . today apparently those guys are going even further . they are EMOANGERANTICIPATIONFEARNEGATIVE everything and anything just to make a profit . not a surprise
this is probably one of the most EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVE articles i have read in my entire life , i really do not understand how this is even happening . over and over again , we are showing to the EMONEGATIVESADNESS people in our country that we do not have the heart or the EMOPOSITIVE to care about them enough . it just makes me so mad !
three quarters of a year after the erika outbreak was declared a global health EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESSSURPRISE , the EMONEGATIVE has infected almost seven hundred thousand men and women across latin america . one estimate in the tens of thousands represents the number of infected EMOANTICIPATION mothers . this is feared to EMOANTICIPATION in fetal deformities .
it would appear to me , in my opinion , the EMONEGATIVEPOSITIVE , EMONEGATIVESADNESS , mainstream media is at it again . let 's use EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVE - mongering and misinformation to stir up a demographic in our all out EMOPOSITIVE against donald EMOSURPRISE . i feel for those who do n't read the EMOPOSITIVE proposals and/or legislation but instead decide to believe every EMOPOSITIVETRUST uttered by the talking head on tv .
" hey everyone , please EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST this ! she appears to be in her EMONEGATIVESADNESS 60s or early 70s , 6'0 " " , 175lbs , with gray hair . this could easily be someone 's EMOPOSITIVE or mom , a family could be EMONEGATIVESADNESS EMODISGUSTNEGATIVESADNESS about her . her outfit sounds like she may of been in some sort of retirement home or something similar . i know if this was my EMOPOSITIVE i could want to know so i could help her get home , so please EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST this within the area so we can maybe get her back to her home and family . "
i hate that tourism and EMOTRUST end up EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS our animal 's habitats ! people are so EMOANGERDISGUSTNEGATIVE while EMOPOSITIVE , and they do not think of how their actions will effect the wildlife in the area . please remember to EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST up your EMODISGUSTNEGATIVESADNESS , do not EMONEGATIVE , and do not EMONEGATIVESADNESSSURPRISE items out that will potentially EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS animals when you are visiting an area . countries need to spend more EMOANTICIPATION and EMOPOSITIVE on saving natural areas for wildlife .
michael bible 's three year old son has cancer . this is so EMOANGERDISGUSTFEARNEGATIVE and sad . i ca n't imagine what they are feeling right now . my uncle died of prostate cancer and i know nothing will ever be the same . cancer on such a EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVESURPRISE EMODISGUSTNEGATIVE seems so cruel if there is a god out there . i am really hoping their son pulls through and they keep on EMOANGERNEGATIVE together as a family .
did you hear about the polar EMOANGERFEAR name pizza called the EMOPOSITIVETRUST 's saddest polar EMOANGERFEAR ? apparently they are not treating it well in china by not EMOPOSITIVE it enough space and turning his life into a circus EMOTRUST . he started to EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS self EMOFEARNEGATIVE because of his living condition . i really hope china comes up with better animal cruelty laws although i EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESSTRUST this will EMOANTICIPATION because of our EMOPOSITIVE difference . it makes me EMOANGERDISGUSTNEGATIVE EMOPOSITIVE animals are being treated like this over there .
i am very EMOFEARSADNESS about our staple crops that we use to EMOPOSITIVE off of . the climate EMOFEAR is likely going to EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS off our crops . we are already seeing signs , and it does n't look good . the EMOANTICIPATIONPOSITIVE in arizona is already seeing this , and no one is listening . only a few news channels are spreading the news . this is going to affect those non technological countries first , which is a EMODISGUSTFEARNEGATIVESADNESS since none of this is their EMONEGATIVESADNESS .
i just can not even imagine something like that happening . what makes someone do such a EMOANGERDISGUSTFEARNEGATIVE thing ? and especially when there were children on EMOANTICIPATION ? such a senseless act . how scared those individuals and the EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS must have been when that was happening . it is a good thing that that guy was there to help the passengers get off the bus . a EMONEGATIVE event would have been even more EMONEGATIVE had he not been there to EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST those people . i feel bad because those individuals ( EMOPOSITIVE the guy who saved the passengers ) are all now scarred for life and their lives will never be the same . their lives have been turned upside down because of someone EMOPOSITIVE 's senseless act and are forever traumatized by it . i hope those victims get the support they need and i hope that the driver 's family receives support
gosh , the emotions i felt while EMOPOSITIVE that . being a EMOPOSITIVETRUST , i would be so scared of such a mass EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESSSURPRISE and EMOANTICIPATIONFEARNEGATIVESADNESS about it people would make it or not . it disgusts me that EMOPOSITIVETRUST people would be used as human shields . how could someone do that to someone else ? and they purposely brought them into the EMOPOSITIVETRUST of the city with the intention of using them as human shields .
a jordanian EMOPOSITIVE was shot and killed outside of a courthouse due to a cartoon he posted EMOANGERDISGUSTNEGATIVESADNESS isis . it 's amazing that someone could be persecuted for EMOANGERDISGUSTNEGATIVESADNESS a terrorist organization who rose to EMOPOSITIVE by EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS people and causing EMOPOSITIVE EMOFEARSADNESS . what reasonable country would EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS someone for this ?
here is an article that EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST much sums up what most people already know about donald EMOSURPRISE and his campaign platform . this is highlights some of the EMOPOSITIVE points , EMOPOSITIVE his stances on immigration , EMODISGUSTFEARNEGATIVESADNESS rights , EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVE rights , corey , the clinton , and a variety of other topics . it 's a good refresher .
death to the EMOFEARPOSITIVETRUST ! there is no member of the EMOFEARPOSITIVETRUST that is your EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST , even those who are no longer on the EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVE . only someone who EMOPOSITIVETRUST recants their position as a EMOFEARPOSITIVETRUST EMOPOSITIVETRUST and demonstrates tangible EMONEGATIVESADNESS about their actions can be accepted . all EMOFEARPOSITIVETRUST are evil , because the EMOFEARPOSITIVETRUST naturally attract people who would abuse their powers .
kyle jenner EMOANGERNEGATIVE like she cares about other people . she makes a transparent marketing move to promote her own product by making up reasons other companies products are bad . it 's EMODISGUSTNEGATIVE fax concern and anyone who reads it should see through the EMODISGUSTNEGATIVE . it is EMOANGERDISGUSTFEARNEGATIVE and she should just advertise like a EMOPOSITIVE human being would .
people often think of what it must be like to be in the 1 % and be ultra EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST . but often times we EMONEGATIVE about the many pressures and responsibilities that come a EMOANTICIPATION with that . take mikhail lenin for example . the man was very well know and EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST and look what happened to him he EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS up dead just like everyone else . now , the conclusion is that it was an EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESSSURPRISE , but the type of people and industries and location of the world leaves a lot of EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS . i EMOSURPRISE thatch a price you have to EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST if you make enemies in the world . you are either looking over your EMOPOSITIVETRUST all the EMOANTICIPATION or EMOPOSITIVE stressed to death . what a world .
hats EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS that someone died in jakarta . i do n't even know what the whole issue was but just to think that just like that your life could be over . i get that EMOANGER is a EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST nasty sport but really when you think about it , it 's quite different around the world then it is here . people think our current state of the EMOTRUST is bad , can you just imagine being in some of these other countries where there seems to be nothing but endless political EMOANGERNEGATIVE . i 've even seen EMOFEARNEGATIVE members punch each other in meetings in some EMONEGATIVE governments . the world is such a EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS place .
putting make up on a train , is that just paint ? ha ha . i do n't want to make too big a deal about this because it is a different EMOPOSITIVE and it would be EMOFEAR to get the EMOPOSITIVE gist without EMOPOSITIVE too much about it . with that said , it 's is EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST worrisome , in this country as well , how much people are telling everyone what they should and should n't be doing . live and let live is still the best way to go about things and comparing putting on make up on a train to pooping on the train is EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST EMOANGERDISGUSTNEGATIVE by any standard .
so i just read that article about alexandria vera . i know you know who she is , and i know the EMOANGERDISGUSTFEARNEGATIVE in you just wants to get in that EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS . i mean , can you imagine the EMOPOSITIVE of a EMOPOSITIVETRUST to exploit a minor in that way . she deserves more than 30 years , if you ask me . and the parents of the minor ought to have been charged with something . that is EMOANGERDISGUSTNEGATIVE . i mean , what is happening in america today ? some of the things i read about make me EMODISGUSTNEGATIVESADNESS !
this story is EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST EMODISGUSTNEGATIVE and i wonder why they suffered heart attacks or whatever it was in the water . if they had per existing EMOANTICIPATIONFEARPOSITIVETRUST conditions , would they have known it would be a bad idea to snorkel ? there should be more precautions in place to make sure people are able to snorkel before they go EMOPOSITIVE and do it .
i read a very disturbing article about a recent EMOPOSITIVE on EMONEGATIVESADNESS resulting from birth control drugs . the EMOPOSITIVE was performed by the EMOANTICIPATIONPOSITIVE of copenhagen and has EMOPOSITIVETRUST a link between hormonal contraceptives and EMONEGATIVESADNESS . the EMOPOSITIVE was EMOPOSITIVE and performed over a decade . the EMOSURPRISE of EMONEGATIVESADNESS was magnified over 28 % when taking the combination EMOPOSITIVETRUST , and even went as high as 78 % in the teenage EMOPOSITIVE ! alternatives to the EMOPOSITIVETRUST which are longer - acting such as the ring and implant were even higher scoring in EMONEGATIVESADNESS . one EMOJOYNEGATIVEPOSITIVE take - away for me in this article is the EMOTRUST that women are only EMOPOSITIVE about six days per month as EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVE to men who are basically EMOPOSITIVE every day , and yet the birth control burden falls on women . hopefully men will EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST that soon .
i just read an article about tour boat that capsized because of the boat operator . it was horrific EMOPOSITIVE the statements of the survivors . it brought chill to my bone when they wrote many situations that could of ended their lives . just imagining what i would of done in that situation makes me feel troubled because i ca nt really EMOANTICIPATIONFEARJOYPOSITIVE in open water . all the survivors are now suing the company for injuries , recklessness , EMONEGATIVE , and trauma . EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS how one event can EMOFEAR the EMOPOSITIVE of life or death .
it a EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS when the people who are their to EMOPOSITIVE and EMONEGATIVETRUST us are EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVE down for no EMOPOSITIVE . my heart goes out to both families in this situation . it totally is EMOANGERDISGUSTNEGATIVESADNESS to EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS for no EMOPOSITIVE because of a EMOANGERDISGUSTNEGATIVE and ill man . it is really upsetting that this man just decides to EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS EMOFEARPOSITIVETRUST officers that are on duty to EMOPOSITIVE us from EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS .
its EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS ! over one million children could n't go to EMOTRUST because the smog was so thick ! they said its like smoking 40 cigarettes a day . that you feel like you are being choked when you walk outside . could you even imagine ? parents taking their kids to the docs and them saying get out of the city for a few days and they will be ok . that 's just EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS to me . so sad .
i did n't realize that a dam could cause so much EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS . it is a EMODISGUSTFEARNEGATIVESADNESS that the people who are going to be impacted the most are the indigenous people . i do n't understand how people feel it is okay to do this to them . maybe there are many pros that i just do n't know about and this article is focusing only on the EMONEGATIVESADNESS of the methyl mercury . i EMOSURPRISE this goes to EMOTRUST that we as a human race can affect the environment in maybe a not so good way . what do you think about this ? i am curious what you have to say about this .
that is just EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS that a person waiting on his surfboard was attacked by a EMONEGATIVE . that must have been EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST scary . i am EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVE that he did n't lose a leg or anything , but still , that would have been very scary . all of the EMOSURPRISE , boom , you are EMOANGERNEGATIVE by a EMONEGATIVE . i do n't think i would want to go to that place again to surf if i was a surfer . i think people need to be EMOANTICIPATIONFEARPOSITIVETRUST when surfing . i do n't think it is really our place to EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVE sharks away , as they live in the water . i think people just need to be smart and surf where there is a very low EMOSURPRISE of being attacked by a EMONEGATIVE .
i really hate isis . they are the EMODISGUSTNEGATIVE of the earth . i just learned that they killed over 100 iraqi EMOFEARPOSITIVETRUST officers in mosul . this is the EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST of thing that happens when we EMOPOSITIVE our troops out of iraq . yeah we should not have been there in the first place but we made that EMONEGATIVESADNESS and we now have to take responsibility for it . i feel so bad for all the iraqi people who just want to live their lives in EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST .
i am shocked and saddened by this earthquake . what a sad and terrible EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS . i feel so sorry for all the victims and those affected by this event . i ca n't even imagine how devastating this must be for them . what an incredible catastrophe . my thoughts and prayers and best wishes go out for all the many people affected by this EMONEGATIVE catastrophe . i hope that everyone stays EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST for the foreseeable future . i am still in EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESURPRISE .
this person 's actions were way over the EMOANTICIPATIONPOSITIVETRUST ! while i may not necessarily like that EMOSURPRISE is in office but i still EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST the EMOTRUST that he is where he is . just because i did n't get my way does n't mean that i would act like this ! this person took away from others and should be punished for what they did .
after EMOPOSITIVE this article it seem like a EMOFEARNEGATIVE is becoming a reality . today drug user , especially opined user , are taking there drugs in front of their children . it seems like the drug user are EMONEGATIVE of taking their drugs and having people around them EMOANGERNEGATIVE with their habits . its really a EMODISGUSTFEARNEGATIVESADNESS that parent are doing these drugs in front of their kids .
it is with many tears , a heavy heart and very mixed emotions that i write that little indivisibly passed away EMOANTICIPATION before midnight after a very , very rough 56 hours . she went through such deep EMONEGATIVESADNESSTRUST in her short life . i was so hoping and EMOANGERNEGATIVE to give her a second EMOSURPRISE at life . a part of me feels a deep EMOPOSITIVE – the last two days were very EMOFEAR and she had so much to cope with . little hindi left this earth EMOANGERDISGUSTNEGATIVE in my arms ( the orphanage had no power so i wrapped us both in a duvet to keep her warm ) it never gets easier . rip little hindi – may your EMOPOSITIVE fly free !
let ’s hope those are very EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS incidents triggered by people with mental health issues . it might be that there were EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS things like that happening before but we heard less about them . still , i’be been EMOPOSITIVE everywhere that hate crimes or incidents motivated by racism are climbing . and it ’s not EMOSURPRISE considering that bigots are being empowered by people in high positions , some in a very high position …
hey , billie bob thornton says angelina josie was never good enough for him . he is EMOSADNESS but she was EMOPOSITIVE , i EMOSURPRISE he had no control over her at all . he stats that angelina had a high stakes and fast lifestyle , even made him EMONEGATIVETRUST lives of blood around their necks . i EMOSURPRISE her saw her as coo EMODISGUSTNEGATIVE and a tad bit EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS or or something . maybe he had to get away from her hectic lifestyle .
mexico is EMOANGERNEGATIVESADNESS by our current EMOPOSITIVETRUST donald j EMOSURPRISE . their currency pesos dropped a lot when he was elected . EMOSURPRISE wants to EMOPOSITIVE a wall between the two countries borders as well . the mexican EMOFEARNEGATIVE seems very EMOANTICIPATIONFEARNEGATIVE about our new glorious EMOPOSITIVETRUST . their EMOTRUST might drop due to the EMOPOSITIVE of the wall and EMONEGATIVE of all the immigrants trying to get into the u.s. by crossing into our borders .
i honestly ca n't believe i just read that whole article about a frog . i absolutely EMOANGERDISGUSTNEGATIVE them . they are some of the most vile creatures on this earth . e. but .... there was something EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST EMOPOSITIVE at the end of the article . one of the researchers claim that over half of all species will be EMONEGATIVESADNESS by the end of the century . that is EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVE ! ! ! ! EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST sure most of that is due to climate EMOFEAR but we have donald EMONEGATIVE hat and company who EMONEGATIVE to acknowledge it or its repercussions .
i find it really EMOJOYPOSITIVE how erika has been around since 1947 and not much EMOANGERNEGATIVESADNESS was made about it until it began EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS people stateside . as EMOPOSITIVETRUST , EMONEGATIVESADNESS bodies are not valued or the conditions surrounding them until the same things begins to EMODISGUSTFEARNEGATIVESADNESS EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST people . erika was minimized and downplayed for over sixty years . that says a lot .
i wonder who shot him and where . did he get shot in the chest ? the arm ? the leg ? the back ? where ? ? ? ? ? and also , where was he when he got shot ? was he inside or outside of the club ? did he drive himself ? was he alone ? did anyone else get shot ? ? ? ? ? ? EMODISGUSTNEGATIVE many questions , so little answers . has anyone been arrested yet ? are there any suspects ? ? ? ? ?
things are really bad in afghanistan right now - i just read an article about the latest . refugees from european countries are being sent home to afghanistan , only to see the EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS first - hand . and there are problems with EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST getting to the people who need them . so many EMOANGERFEARSADNESS people in bad EMOPOSITIVE . i wish countries would get together and EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST and welcome immigration . if everyone had enough EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST to live comfortably , things would surely EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST .
just read a short article about the kim EMOPOSITIVETRUST robbery . EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST scary for her , and the robbers kept EMONEGATIVE money . there were language / EMOTRUST issues between her and the robbers , she EMOANTICIPATION they wanted her jewelry , and they wanted her money . i hope that she gets better security in place so that this never happens again . the article mentioned her EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST EMOPOSITIVE about her expensive EMOJOYPOSITIVE ring on facebook - i think there 's a EMOANTICIPATIONPOSITIVETRUST to be learned about that .
i 'm deeply EMOANGERNEGATIVESADNESS to hear about actions being taking that could potentially curtail EMONEGATIVESADNESS americans ' EMOPOSITIVE to vote . the gop has obviously been EMOPOSITIVE to sabotage voting of minorities because they see them as a EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVE since they do not traditionally vote for republican candidates . this needs to stop .
i know we have been talking about climate EMOFEAR , my EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST . i read a news article that continues to EMOPOSITIVE upon the EMOPOSITIVE EMOPOSITIVE that we have speculated upon . as it turns out , a mere one EMOPOSITIVE celsius EMOFEAR can have EMOPOSITIVE impacts on the ecosystem . it affects genes and ranges in species . more than eighty percent of ecosystems are being put under EMONEGATIVE . it makes me sad because we do n't know the EMOANTICIPATION - EMOPOSITIVE implications in the largest perspective . every single day we can make choices to help negate the bad choices our species makes towards our environment .
i had no idea shannon daugherty was going through breast cancer . it is such a EMONEGATIVESADNESS situation to experience . cancer really does humble the soul into new places that one never EMOANTICIPATION possible to emerge stronger from feeling . it sounds like she faced it with a mask of EMOPOSITIVETRUST at first . after EMOANTICIPATION , the EMOPOSITIVETRUST emotions came through where she realized the EMOPOSITIVETRUST was not in being stoic but admitting how EMONEGATIVESADNESS it really is to experience . it is through supposed EMONEGATIVE that we become stronger .
floyd may weather owes a jewelry EMOANTICIPATIONPOSITIVE some money . it seems like it 's the richest people in the world that always find some EMONEGATIVE either not to EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST taxes or not to EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST someone money that is owed . he has all that money , and he has to be sued to EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST for something that he could have easily paid for in EMOPOSITIVE upfront . people like him are EMOANGERDISGUSTNEGATIVE . there are so many people out here EMONEGATIVE , and here he is sitting in his mansion not paying for something he bought .
i am not sure what to think of this article as i have probably a different opinion than most would . first of all why would n't she report this at the EMOANTICIPATION it happened , instead of waiting years and years later to come EMOPOSITIVE ? i get the whole he 's a powerful person and nobody would believe her part , but who 's really going to believe her years later and why would she come out with it now and not before ? what EMOFEAR ? why is she willing to exploit this man years later but was n't able to do it years before ?
hey can you believe the EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS weather we 've been having during the past few summers ? it 's getting really EMOANGERDISGUSTNEGATIVE and out of hand . they temperatures have been EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS and the flooding is really messing with people 's lives . we really should be paying more EMOPOSITIVE to it and need to come up with some solutions fast .
i think that this is really sad . it seems to be something that is ingrained in all humans . i am EMOJOYPOSITIVE that it mostly just effects children , but it seems EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST of EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS that we will ever EMOPOSITIVETRUST solve this EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS . i think the only EMOPOSITIVETRUST way is for adults to be consistently EMOFEARPOSITIVETRUST and make sure that we are not ignoring the kids that this is effecting .
hey d , i read this article about this EMODISGUSTNEGATIVE who was abused and went through stuff with his family . i feel like i can really relate to him , having a mother who had their own addictions . i always knew people like him always come out on EMOANTICIPATIONPOSITIVETRUST because he went through so much to get the EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVE that he is having today . i wanted to EMOTRUST this to you so that you do n't give up either , no matter how hard the circumstances are . EMOJOYPOSITIVE , a.
in all EMOPOSITIVETRUST . i have read so many of these articles it is all starting to run together and i am forgetting what i am EMOPOSITIVE . the EMOANTICIPATION and EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST i have EMONEGATIVE on this is starting to look like it is not EMOPOSITIVE EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVE the EMOANGERNEGATIVE because it is becoming EMOANGERDISGUSTNEGATIVESADNESS EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST EMOANGERNEGATIVE EMOANTICIPATION i am spending EMOPOSITIVE all these articles and EMODISGUSTFEARNEGATIVESADNESS EMOANTICIPATION
poor orangutan . i hope her treatment is EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST and she is able to return to living in the EMONEGATIVESURPRISE , or at least in a zoo . you hear a lot of stories these days about illegal animal trading . humans need to EMOPOSITIVE that EMONEGATIVESURPRISE animals are not there for our entertainment and should be kept in their habitats .
it 's sad that there are still outbreaks of EMODISGUSTFEARNEGATIVESADNESS and other diseases that are easily preventable with sanitation and access to EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST EMONEGATIVE water . if we all pitch in just a couple dollars , the cost of buying a bottle of water , i bet we could make a significant contribution to the EMOPOSITIVE EMOPOSITIVE in yemen .
a russian fighter jet crashed into the EMOPOSITIVE EMOPOSITIVE as it attempted to EMOPOSITIVE on an aircraft carrier . the EMOPOSITIVETRUST safely ejected from the aircraft . many russian naval vessels are not off the EMOPOSITIVE of syria in russia 's support of the syrian EMOFEARNEGATIVE . many britain are EMOFEARSADNESS over russian warships EMOPOSITIVE through british waters . but russia says its EMOPOSITIVE is about maintaining and safeguarding it 's maritime economic activity and responding to new kinds of EMONEGATIVE and international terrorism .
hey t , i EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST an article that i EMOANTICIPATION you would be interested in . it is about how iraqis EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST evidence of torture by islamic state in mass graves near the city mosul . can you believe that , they literally just killed and dumped bodies there . from what the articles says in just one hours EMOANTICIPATION they EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST 20 to 25 bodies . some where hard to even tell if it were human or not . they still ca n't figure out how they died but they will soon enough . though from the state of EMODISGUSTFEARNEGATIVESADNESS it has only been a few weeks that they have been there . all i can say is that were tortured point blank .
it 's very upsetting to me that people feel they still need to poach elephants and rhinos just for their ivory . it 's a species that you are making EMONEGATIVESADNESS here . why are people not trying to control or help the situation more ? there has to be some EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST d of co trolling standards for the extinction of the rhino and elephant . i believe i saw something not that EMOANTICIPATION ago that actually painted the tusks and got s of elephants and rhinos that permanently stained them so the poachers work not beadle ti use the ivory . they stained them a pink or EMOSADNESS color . we should try and EMOPOSITIVE that and do that so no one will EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS these animals . if that 's possible .
" i was EMOPOSITIVE about the EMOFEARNEGATIVE in iraq . not gon na EMOANGERDISGUSTNEGATIVESADNESS , i could n't read it all . logically you know " " EMOFEARNEGATIVE is hell " " but all the details of it were too much for me . i tried , but EMOPOSITIVE of who 's got a head head EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS , who got gassed , it was too much . i flinch when i hear the EMOANGERNEGATIVE " " EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS EMOFEARSADNESS " " on the news , so EMOPOSITIVE about people being dragged into the city to be used as human shields was too much . i font get it . how can people be so EMOANGERDISGUSTFEARNEGATIVE to each other . bomb and attacks require calculated EMOPOSITIVE i just ca nt EMOPOSITIVE . "
" after EMOPOSITIVE an article about the EMOANGERNEGATIVE happened years ago , i am now traumatized with easily trusting people . it is indeed a EMOFEARNEGATIVE for all the victims to be involved in this EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST of EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS . it is a EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVE to EMOTRUST people again and invest your money on something . it is always good to know your rights before EMOPOSITIVE away the so called " " EMOTRUST " " . "
lung cancer is one of the most EMOFEARNEGATIVE and strong EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS . it is scary to think that someone might be carrying that EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST of disease just because of them having a hard EMOANTICIPATION letting go of smoking . also , thinking that even the non - smoking people can get EMODISGUSTNEGATIVESADNESS and worst they can even have cancer too . just thinking how things worked regarding cancer is traumatizing me .
i am stressed about this article since gasoline is involved . gasoline is a big thing not just for me , my family , my friends but it is a big thing for everyone . it is always a bad news to know that something like this happened or happening because it will slow down the work we have to do . it destroys plans and EMOTRUST of every individual .
you see this ? mostly this just pisses me off . america takes ten thousand refugees . whoopee . people are dying , and they need somewhere EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST , and all we do is take ten thousand . and let 's face it america 's hands are n't EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST in the middle east , or africa . america has learned nothing from past wars . we should be EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST help to get people out and a EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST place for them to stay , but instead we just let them EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS , getting EMODISGUSTNEGATIVE in their cities and drowned at EMOPOSITIVE . so i 'm EMOANGERDISGUSTNEGATIVE about this . what EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST of society have we become when we let this EMOANTICIPATION ? america should be doing so much more , to help these people . it 's EMOANGERDISGUSTNEGATIVE to think ten thousand is somehow being EMOPOSITIVETRUST , being EMOANGERPOSITIVETRUST . they 're just trying to find a EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST place , away from the EMOPOSITIVETRUST EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVE of death everyday , for themselves and ht
our country is really at a place right now where its going the EMONEGATIVE direction of what an ideal society should be and how a lot people are EMONEGATIVESADNESS about the future as well . this has clearly been shown with the EMOFEAR of EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS hotlink and EMONEGATIVE calls . we need to EMOJOYPOSITIVE a more positive and EMOPOSITIVE society in order for every person to feel appreciated on a EMOANTICIPATION basis . as well as we should be taking care of the environment to EMONEGATIVE all these environmental effects such as massive EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS like hurricanes cause by human abusing the environment .
when is the world going to realize that they need to EMOANTICIPATION charging bullies with murder when kids EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS themselves ? seriously , if you torture someone emotionally , how is that different from doing it physically ? it 's not . you 're doing an EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVE amount of EMOANGERDISGUSTNEGATIVESADNESS to someone 's psyche , enough for them to commit EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS . EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS the kids bullying as adults , and EMOANTICIPATION EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS these kids harshly enough to deter them from doing it ever again . any adults aware and ignoring it ? charge them as accomplices to murder .
i and my EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST always remain together . he has done a lot of help for me . he has been very hard for some EMOANTICIPATION to help me with money . but he did not EMOANTICIPATIONPOSITIVESURPRISETRUST me anything.he is one of my family . he has great EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST for me.he and i have come together in the EMOTRUST season.from that day he and i were not separated .
mfg . seriously ? ! this can not be EMOPOSITIVETRUST . i EMONEGATIVE to believe this is EMOPOSITIVETRUST . someone made this EMODISGUSTNEGATIVE up , right ? japanese EMOPOSITIVE historically EMOPOSITIVE disregards and degrades women ( eh : geisha girls ) , but ff what year is this ? < slowly bangs head on desk > japanese women still EMOTRUST their mouths when they EMOJOYPOSITIVESURPRISE . are japanese men that threatened by empowering women ? cause i 'm thinking apparently so .
hey dude did you see that article that come out about EMOFEARPOSITIVETRUST torture in chicago ? it 's EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS and damning - it 's one thing to know this kinda thing has been going on but its another thing to see all of these EMOPOSITIVE documents EMOPOSITIVE about EMOPOSITIVE torturing people and that it 's still going on today . how EMOANGERDISGUSTFEARNEGATIVE .
firstly let me say that she was not asking for it just by wearing expensive jewelry . the same people who believe that are those who believe women are asking to be assaulted just by wearing provocative clothes ; dis gusting . secondly , let me just say that i EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST chloe for expressing her EMOJOYPOSITIVE and not being EMOFEARNEGATIVE of all the haters out there . EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST .
did you see where that australian hiker EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST after 2 weeks in malaysian EMOFEAR . he only had one day of EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST with him . he lived on berries and stuff . i think i could EMOPOSITIVE in the woods like that . i know a lot about native plants so i would do EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST good . of course as EMOANTICIPATION as it was n't some place EMONEGATIVE . the EMOFEAR would be hard but only if there are EMONEGATIVESURPRISE animals that would like to EMOPOSITIVE you for their EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST . at least the weather would be better .
i just read about the haitians who came here after the earthquake . while i wish we could help everyone we just ca n't . only so many EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST in this country and unless we want to become another 3rd world country we have to send them home . make them EMOANTICIPATIONNEGATIVE in line just like any other EMOPOSITIVETRUST EMOFEAR . why should they be given EMOJOYPOSITIVE privileges to be in this country . i hate to be mean but if you are n't here legally then you have to go home .
EMONEGATIVE ! i just read an very disturbing article about a 23 year old male EMOPOSITIVETRUST charged with multiple counts of EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVE EMODISGUSTNEGATIVE that was taking place at the EMOTRUST he teased in . he managed to get away with this EMOANGERNEGATIVE for a very EMOANTICIPATION EMOANTICIPATION as he lured hundreds of children into his EMONEGATIVE before finally getting EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVE . it really pisses me off that EMODISGUSTNEGATIVE bags like this are allowed near our children and i hope he gets a max sentence !
wow , this is EMONEGATIVE . i really hope that china will EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST their safety standards , but i know this is a big EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS all over in developing countries . remember when that factory burned down in bangladesh ? and we ca n't EMONEGATIVE this is n't our EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS too , when we support them economically . if we buy products created in EMOFEARNEGATIVE EMOPOSITIVE conditions , we have a hand in those deaths too .
i 'm not sure why this qualifies as news ... i do n't care about whatever is happening in maria carey 's life . i especially do n't care about guys making other guys EMOANGERDISGUSTNEGATIVE .... i feel for her ex boyfriend or husband or whatever , as it 's not EMOPOSITIVE to purposely make an ex EMOANGERDISGUSTNEGATIVE . she could still meet him but i would do it away from cameras .
what a EMODISGUSTFEARNEGATIVESADNESS . i wish the article went more into detail about what happened to the actress and the guy she was with . i 'm assuming they just EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS in and then used tear gas on the couple ? how did they EMOANTICIPATIONFEARNEGATIVEPOSITIVE from the masked men ? or did the masked guys just EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS stuff and then EMONEGATIVESADNESSSURPRISE ? i 'm not sure what the EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVE laws in france are but these reports would make me feel EMODISGUSTFEARNEGATIVE there .
better go stock up on coconut products . it seems coconuts are in EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS due to some EMODISGUSTFEARNEGATIVESADNESS wiping out coconut trees in the caribbean . many EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVE it will spread to other coconut EMOPOSITIVE countries . the techno people are trying to breed some EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST of cure . they are using gene banks to come up with a EMOPOSITIVE but costs are prohibitive . there ’s an international coconut genetic EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST EMOANTICIPATION or EMOPOSITIVETRUST that ’s getting some funding but even it ’s in trouble financially . they are looking for coconut product users and big companies to help out . have a heart , EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST the coconut trees !
it looks like wells fargo was illegally confiscating cars of service members to EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST off debts , repossessing them . this is a terrible situation and thing to do , i ca n't imagine having my car repossessed , and how awful that must be on so many levels . not having your car , having to EMOANTICIPATIONFEAR them take it away , and everything .
i 've noticed there is a lot of disasters going on in the world . it is scaring me a little . i think that us humans have EMONEGATIVESADNESS for that . this world cares way to much about money . if we did n't care to much about money we would have less problems going on . i honestly feel this world is EMOANTICIPATION to an end . i do n't see any improvements or feel there is going to be any improvements . there is more natural disasters , new diseases , EMODISGUSTNEGATIVESADNESS , cancer more and more people are dying . so many people need mental help a lot of us are very EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS and EMOANTICIPATIONFEARNEGATIVE . i think it is very EMOPOSITIVETRUST for us to stay closer to god .
a lot of us not just veterans are EMOANGERNEGATIVESADNESS sleep . i believe its because of EMONEGATIVESADNESS . we are n't EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST and its because of money . humans are always EMOPOSITIVE they have no life . work is not life . some people do n't get to spend EMOANTICIPATION with there kids or family . they ca nt even have EMOANTICIPATION for themselves . there EMONEGATIVESADNESS about work , what EMOANTICIPATION they have to get up , or what they will EMOPOSITIVE because they do n't have EMOANTICIPATION to cook . so we EMOPOSITIVE EMODISGUSTFEARNEGATIVESADNESS thing that can EMOPOSITIVE to EMONEGATIVESADNESS . not getting enough sleep or the right nutrients EMOPOSITIVE to sicknesses . therese people who do n't have enough EMOANTICIPATION to see a EMOPOSITIVETRUST . our lifestyle is the EMOPOSITIVE we 're not getting enough sleep . people put way to much on there plate just so they can have money . everything is about money .
i ca n't imagine the EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVE and EMOANGERNEGATIVE that must be happening for these people to not only be attacked in this manner but to be in such a remote area that help can not get you in a EMOPOSITIVE fashion . these senseless acts are obviously those of cowards that have no regard for human life and should be captured and dealt with harshly . there is not enough room in this world for people that would do this to others for any cause or EMOTRUST . i hope that everyone that can be saved and cared for is able to get what they need in order to recover physically . i know that the emotional EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST for all of them and their families will take much more EMOANTICIPATION and help for these poor people that have had to EMOPOSITIVE such an atrocity . i can only hope we never see events such as this in my own family .
" hos mother would wish their EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVE dead over being EMONEGATIVE . that has to be one of the worst things i have read in quite some EMOANTICIPATION . i have a very hard EMOANTICIPATION digesting that the mother could overcome her EMOJOYPOSITIVE 's death over her EMONEGATIVESADNESS , she clearly has some things that she needs to work out because while being EMONEGATIVE is not ideal the girl can and will overcome her EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS . it is truly EMONEGATIVESADNESS that they live n a place where the need to " " own " " EMOPOSITIVE comes at the cost of this girls eyesight . it seems to me it was in an EMOPOSITIVE to reduce EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS that these pellets were used and a EMOANGERDISGUSTFEARNEGATIVE EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESSSURPRISE that EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS her . "
seriously , timeshares ? ! i can not believe it is even an issue for someone to get EMONEGATIVE their timeshare . these companies seem to want to be your best EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST to get you to buy a timeshare , but once you do they do not care about you , your family , or what situation your life is in . they make it hard to get rid of because most of their customers are EMOSADNESS people who do n't always want to go through the hassle . these people need EMOPOSITIVE because the timeshare companies make it too hard to get rid of . although they may say that they have an easy process to EMONEGATIVE , but after undercover investigations , that proved to be EMONEGATIVE . if someone bought something like this for their family to EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST but now their family is grown and gone , why should they have to EMOANTICIPATIONPOSITIVETRUST with it ?
i ca n't believe what a EMOANGERNEGATIVE EMOPOSITIVE fish can be . the EMOTRUST that they can cause so much EMOANGERDISGUSTNEGATIVESADNESS to an environment and have no natural predators is EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS . it makes you second EMOSURPRISE flushing the fish down the EMODISGUSTNEGATIVE as it may EMOPOSITIVE . it 's hard to believe that they get so big since they are usually just little fish in a EMONEGATIVE tank . also it 's EMODISGUSTNEGATIVE that they travel so far considering we usually just see them swimming in circles .
of course i only know what i read in the article . it sounds like it could be the ex EMOFEARPOSITIVETRUST EMOPOSITIVETRUST was trying to EMOPOSITIVE himself . the son was already arrested for assaulted the EMOTRUST . i believe the EMOFEARPOSITIVETRUST will EMOPOSITIVE the EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVE and take the necessary actions . i do n't think the EMOFEARPOSITIVETRUST will look the other way just because he is an ex EMOFEARPOSITIVETRUST EMOPOSITIVETRUST .
this man should be EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST EMOANGERNEGATIVESADNESS . there is no way he forgot that his son was in the car . the EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVE would have been able to speak . he would have been in a front facing car seat . there is no way he did n't see him . he is EMOANGERNEGATIVESADNESS and he needs to be punished . he should be put in EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS for life . this poor EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVE suffered a great deal and this man needs to EMONEGATIVE .
i was shocked at these statistics . temperatures are becoming dangerously high . the culprits is the fossil fuel industries . we need to hold them EMOPOSITIVETRUST , the EMOFEARNEGATIVE has failed , but how can we have EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST in our governments to take this EMOPOSITIVE when they EMOANTICIPATIONPOSITIVETRUST to hand nearly hundreds of billions of dollars in EMOFEARNEGATIVE subsidies to the coal , gas , and oil industries ? ending these subsidies would be a EMOFEAR step towards solving the climate EMONEGATIVE saving gigs ones of carbon dioxide emissions , and helping make EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST energy cheaper than fossil fuels , we need to do something and do it now
the state in syria is bad . the syrian conflation has a EMOANTICIPATIONFEARPOSITIVETRUST source in EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVE - held aleppo told the EMOFEAR news agency that a EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS of blood meant hospitals were struggling to deal with the huge number of casualties caused by air strikes over the past four days . there was also no water EMOPOSITIVE in many areas after pumping stations were damaged at the weekend , and several EMOJOYPOSITIVE kitchens were EMOFEARNEGATIVE to close because of the EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS .
this is a very tricky story , cook a 20 - year - old business EMOPOSITIVE with no EMOANGERDISGUSTFEARNEGATIVE history , has seemingly been charged , tried , and convicted . there is a lot of evidence EMOANTICIPATION out to accuse him of sexual harassment and rape but he denies and calls it consensual acts of EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST . his EMOANGERDISGUSTFEARNEGATIVE has asked that cook is not crucified on what is being said but by EMOPOSITIVETRUST .
there is some EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS in indonesia most likely EMOTRUST to muslims . overall i 'm not EMOSURPRISE by this news , the islam EMOTRUST holds many radicals and there are enough EMOTRUST that the EMOANTICIPATIONPOSITIVETRUST leaders of these islam groups support oppression . just look at at all the ha jibs in these muslim countries these are sad EMODISGUSTNEGATIVESADNESS men that are EMOFEARNEGATIVE of women .
i just read this article about a EMOFEARNEGATIVE that was EMOPOSITIVETRUST for EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS 100,000 people . can you believe that ! ? the EMOFEARNEGATIVE was caused by fires used to clear rain forest , if i remember correctly . i mean could you imagine that happening here . it is unfathomable . i know we have our wildfires but very few people EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS to them . imagine what people are going through .
a car taliban car bomb exploded in front of the german consulate in afghanistan . it killed 100 people . these type of events are to come these days . i mean how does anyone process them any more . i 'm personally EMONEGATIVE to all this now . it might as well be fiction at this point . it seems like i hear about similar incidents like this everyday . i do n't know .
even though fewer people are crossing this year than in 2015 , more people are dying as they try to make the EMOANTICIPATIONFEARJOYPOSITIVE . bodies of migrants in a boat off the EMOPOSITIVE of libya in october . at least 29 people died in the EMOSURPRISE , all in their 20s . one person out of every 88 has been EMONEGATIVESADNESS at EMOPOSITIVE trying to reach the shores of greece , italy or spain . that means they 're 90 times more likely to EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS on the EMOANTICIPATIONFEARJOYPOSITIVE than an american is likely to EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS of gunshot wounds .
toughie , the world 's last barbs ' fringe - limned tree frog and a symbol of the extinction EMONEGATIVE , has died at his home in the atlanta botanical EMOJOYPOSITIVE . the famed frog 's age is EMOANTICIPATIONFEARNEGATIVE , but he 's at least 12 years old , and likely EMOSADNESS , because he was an adult when collected in 2005.mark candice , who worked with toughie for seven years , says the frog 's story is n't entirely EMOPOSITIVESURPRISE . “ a lot of EMOPOSITIVE had been paid to him in EMONEGATIVESADNESS , so he even has his own wikipedia page , ” candice , head of the amphibian EMOPOSITIVE , notes . “ but there are plenty of other species out there that are disappearing , sometimes before we even knew that they were there . ”in EMOTRUST , toughie 's own species ( economical karakorum ) was n't described until 2008 ,
i font really have feeling towards the article i just read . this article did not really EMOPOSITIVE me in the slightest . on the other hand i do feel like any one that is associated with bin EMONEGATIVE or that any one that is as sympathizer or a terrorist should be indicted and charged with acts of terrorism .
what 's going on in venezuela is just EMONEGATIVE . the EMOFEARNEGATIVE has no concern for it 's EMOPOSITIVE 's . these are just kids trying to get an education . they ca n't get a EMOPOSITIVE meal . waiting in line doing anything to help their children . how can we let this go on . no one can be EMOANTICIPATION to EMOPOSITIVE or do anything EMOPOSITIVE if they ca n't even get the basic necessities
what a EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS this is ! i feel so bad for all the owners who EMONEGATIVESADNESS their pets in that situation . pets are like members of your family , and EMOANGERNEGATIVESADNESS a EMONEGATIVE is no different . my heart goes out to all of the people who are effected by this . there is nothing this business can do to bring back the animals that died and EMOPOSITIVE the owners EMODISGUSTFEARNEGATIVESADNESS . hopefully they never let something like this EMOANTICIPATION again .
that poor EMODISGUSTNEGATIVE must have just gotten curious and looked down , or perhaps he tripped and EMONEGATIVESADNESS into it . i ca n't imagine the EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS he must have gone through being stuck in there for days until he finally died . that must have been EMOFEARNEGATIVE and terrible . how could the EMOTRUST not have EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST him by then ? surely he screamed ? it 's so sad .
as someone who graduated with a stem EMOPOSITIVE i know firsthand just how few women there are in the field . it 's very sad , and it does indeed rob us of EMOPOSITIVE . all you have to do is look around to see how america is still a man - run country . the number of women in power is EMONEGATIVE , and women feel conflicted between what society says they should do and what they want to do . after all , many have aspirations besides raising kids . who says that the ' house - mom ' idea is right ? the gender EMONEGATIVE needs to close , and the wage EMONEGATIVE . women are not paid as much as men . that 's a EMOTRUST .
it is EMODISGUSTFEARNEGATIVE that there are places that would actively want to get immunized and ca nt due to EMONEGATIVE of EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST . while at the same EMOANTICIPATION in america there are parents who actively keep their children from getting them . their should be social consequences in place the parents who intentionally EMOANTICIPATIONFEARNEGATIVE their children like this . i would think a hefty EMONEGATIVESADNESS that goes to implementing vaccines in impoverished areas would be a great idea .
" here is another upsetting article i am sending you about a EMOFEAR and a family . funny how this bothers me more than the previous one . the parents and the children got out EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST and they did n't EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS and they did n't get maimed or even scratched as far as i can tell but their two cats died and they EMONEGATIVESADNESS their home . i am a cat owner and they are always " " skirmished " " and EMOFEARNEGATIVE so my first EMOANTICIPATION is how terrified they must have been and then how awful the children must feel . the horror of imagining your EMONEGATIVE burning ( though they probably died from smoke ) . the children will not understand and it will take awhile to EMONEGATIVE . "
another story that i am sending about janet reno . EMOANTICIPATION she lived a good and EMOANTICIPATION life , i always felt sorry for her and always wondered why she accepted the EMONEGATIVESADNESS EMOPOSITIVE of EMOANGERFEARPOSITIVETRUST EMOPOSITIVETRUST . i felt sorry since she was often attacked for not only political reasons but her appearance also . she was EMODISGUSTNEGATIVESADNESS and somewhat EMOPOSITIVE looking and the media used that against her . made EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVE of her . this article mentions an encounter with eleanor roosevelt and her looks remind me of janet . so maybe that is why she took the post . wanted to be like her hero .
the article also good . the four key things can do while helping a EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST who may have anxiety or hanging out with their friends as much anymore or are always EMONEGATIVE and feeling down . EMOTRUST they see a EMOPOSITIVETRUST or health EMOPOSITIVETRUST and/or help them to make possible , the person 's EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST or a EMOPOSITIVE EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST may be able to give
the article also good.but some times also said EMOANTICIPATIONFEARPOSITIVETRUST teams were examining the bodies and trying to determine their identities . “ the EMOANTICIPATION is just beginning , ” he said . the iraqi joint command issued a brief EMOPOSITIVETRUST condemning the islamic state . “ gangs of isis militants EMOANTICIPATIONPOSITIVETRUST to commit crimes against our people , ” the EMOFEAR said . fighters from the islamic state , also known as isis , have held the city of mosul and surrounding towns and villages for more than two years .
how could this guy been shot several times , yet managed to make it to the hospital and tell what happened to him . it would seem like he would be in critical condition if that 's the EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS . sounds very EMOANGERANTICIPATIONNEGATIVE . and for what EMOPOSITIVE would a random person just be EMONEGATIVESADNESS EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVE in a night club . the reporters need to get down to what really happened there .
i have come across an article about the civilian casualties in afghanistan . the EMOFEARNEGATIVE is such a terrible thing . EMONEGATIVE children are dying just because of some EMOFEAR operations , i.e. some grown - ups can not EMOPOSITIVETRUST and EMOPOSITIVE on resolution of the disagreements . my heart aches as i read that EMODISGUSTNEGATIVE children corpses are tended by EMONEGATIVESADNESS relatives . it must be unbearably painful to exist in such pitiful condition in such a poor country and on EMOANTICIPATIONPOSITIVETRUST of that to lose your children . life is so EMOANGERDISGUSTNEGATIVESADNESS and cruel sometimes .
it is known that endoscopy saves lives , but the EMOANTICIPATION can be so EMODISGUSTNEGATIVESADNESS . i am so EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST that researchers are EMOPOSITIVE towards making it more tolerable so that more people will undergo the EMOFEARPOSITIVE that can EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST their lives . i am EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST that many different options are available : not all involving colon EMOPOSITIVE ( e.g. x - rays ) , that there is a EMOANTICIPATIONPOSITIVE EMOTRUST to EMONEGATIVE the EMONEGATIVESADNESS ( which EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST to EMOPOSITIVE before the EMOFEARPOSITIVE ) , etc . so , the person ’s quality of life , their well - being in the short term is taken seriously into EMOTRUST .
global warming is EMOPOSITIVETRUST . the effects that is having on the polar bears will soon have the same effects on us . the research is showing that the bears are having shorter seasons of breeding and EMOANGERANTICIPATIONFEARNEGATIVE . the ice is melting at a EMOPOSITIVETRUST rate , but there is already a 7 to 9 day shift on the b EMOANTICIPATION that they spend on the ice . they do most of their EMOANGERANTICIPATIONFEARNEGATIVE on the ice and that how to meet their mates , so it is very EMOPOSITIVETRUST to them . it may not seem EMOPOSITIVETRUST to you yet , but as the ice melts it will not only EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS the bears it will EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS you too . EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVE EMOPOSITIVE EMOPOSITIVETRUST will EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS people like you that live in coastal areas . i hope you EMOFEAR your mind on how you feel about global warming and the melting of the ice . our actions may have an affect on the polar bears and i believe we should think about it .
before EMOPOSITIVE this article i use to think that flint was the only EMOPOSITIVE water EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS and i know that people have more on , but flint is still having a water EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS . i 'm mad that california is the only state to pass laws for people to have rights to EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST water . i know california has water issues with EMONEGATIVE , but nobody should go with out EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST water . EMOPOSITIVE the article , reminds me that this is a world wide issue and we must figure a way to EMOPOSITIVETRUST fresh and EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST water to everyone . especially those in need .
it feels like this is a bit of a EMOANGERDISGUSTNEGATIVESADNESS and them just trying to EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVE monger and use gm 's . grass and other things will EMOPOSITIVE .. global warming simply means that we have too much EMODISGUSTNEGATIVE and it affects everything . reduce EMODISGUSTNEGATIVE and chemicals and we wo n't have such an issue . this article is simply scientists trying to make us sicker with more chemicals .
i am not sure what i just read . it seems to be about some sports event which i care little about . sports are not my EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST thing and i do n't know how anyone could lose sleep over a sports event . much more EMOPOSITIVETRUST things in life . i also am not sure how to write such a EMOANTICIPATION EMOPOSITIVE based on a very short paragraph about sports .
this is a EMOFEARNEGATIVE EMOPOSITIVE and i wish no one would do it . some have to feed their families so i understand if it 's the only EMOPOSITIVE available . however- the EMOFEARNEGATIVE should make it EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST for them . it is EMONEGATIVE and it seems it can not be made safer . my condolences . i would n't want my family to work in one .
" so i just had to read this article for a survey . it was EMOPOSITIVE unformulated , an enormous text - wall essay list . i made it all the way through though . i 'm not really into sports , which the article focused on , but the article did EMOPOSITIVE about a bunch of prominent women in sports and their accomplishments . it was a little hard to follow because i 'm not really EMOPOSITIVETRUST with a lot of sports terminology or what accomplishments are big deals . i think people generally care more about men 's performances , but it 's good that women can be recognized for their accomplishments in sports too . there was one bit about a woman who got some EMOPOSITIVE over what the EMOPOSITIVE called a " " raunchy " " photo EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVE . i think that 's kinda EMODISGUSTNEGATIVE that something like that was even EMOPOSITIVE in an article with feminist tone . "
this is really EMODISGUSTNEGATIVESADNESS and disturbing do n't you think ? these soccer hooligans got all EMONEGATIVE and worked up and when they were acting out like idiots they EMOANGERNEGATIVE an eleven - year - old EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVE in the head with a bottle . poor kid had a big EMOFEARNEGATIVE and had to go to the hospital and everything . that 's EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST sad and EMODISGUSTNEGATIVESADNESS , even though they probably did n't really mean to do it .
this is a terrible story . in a way , i feel EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST that the EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVE no longer has to EMONEGATIVE . had the EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVE lived he would be EMODISGUSTNEGATIVE for the EMOPOSITIVE of his life . i am just EMOANGERDISGUSTNEGATIVE at the mother . this is what happens when a state has weak laws . she is only facing 15 years for what she did . she should be given the death EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS . i am disgusted with the EMOPOSITIVETRUST EMOTRUST . thank god i do n't live in california .
EMOPOSITIVE c. , i just read an article about EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVE deaths -- specifically when guns are used against children . EMONEGATIVE , EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS cases that happened in EMONEGATIVE towns . as i was EMOPOSITIVE the background and history of the families , it occurred to me that there 's a strong socioeconomic component present , and that the people described were n't what you and i would call middle - class , and definitely not well - EMOPOSITIVE . it 's like we were talking about the other day , i do n't think that the dens can possibly win this EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVE unless they are able to EMOANTICIPATION to EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVE owners . i do n't think that this EMOSURPRISE is going to EMOFEAR -- i mean , when you think about it , guns symbolize power , and in the article i read , what came across is that the people who used them against children ( one EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVE against another ) need to feel power .
" EMOPOSITIVE c. , it 's so EMODISGUSTNEGATIVE how little i know about the EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST i EMOPOSITIVE . just read an article about bananas , the EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST you buy in a supermarket , which are apparently called cavendish bananas and are expressly considered " " commercial " " . apparently , commercial bananas are under EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVE due to their EMONEGATIVE of genetic diversity , making them prone to fungal diseases -- another variation , " " big mike " " , went the way of the buffalo in the 60s for the same EMOPOSITIVE . i am not certain about the suggestion that EMONEGATIVESURPRISE bananas be used to produce new variations , tho . i have a EMONEGATIVE that this would drive the cost of bananas up , which is concerning . it might be possible in someplace like the u.s. , where we have money for r & d , but i EMOANTICIPATIONFEARNEGATIVESADNESS about how this would affect people in poorer countries . "
just read that due to climate EMOFEAR , hotter than normal temps may be the new normal . in 2013 , temps screamed up to 122 f. in australia , which is frightening . but when you think about who really has the capacity to EMOFEAR this -- which is each individual -- it gets even more frightening . the EMOPOSITIVE cause of climate EMOFEAR is just too many people , EMOPOSITIVE stop . i do not have much hope that people will stop procreating to EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST themselves , and this is the biggest EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS of all .
EMOTRUST should be a EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST of EMOPOSITIVE . some people are christians and some are muslims or islamic . this makes me sad christians chose a different EMOTRUST so why should the islams brutalize them and EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS them ? that is cruelty and one of the reasons why there will always be EMOFEARNEGATIVE in those countries . i do n't think i would ever want to EMOPOSITIVE those places , i would be very scared . they target christians and EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS priests . these people are EMONEGATIVESADNESS , forcing these people out of their home .
i EMOANGERDISGUSTNEGATIVE this on the no - EMONEGATIVEPOSITIVE policies of barack obama . he made a lot of hope and EMOFEAR promises and delivered nothing . after 8 years peoples lives have n't gotten better . having a EMOPOSITIVE between donald EMOSURPRISE and hillary clinton is EMOANGERDISGUSTNEGATIVE . the mainstream media carries a lot of this EMOANGERDISGUSTNEGATIVE as well for not informing the EMOANTICIPATIONPOSITIVE about issues and only reporting sensationalism EMODISGUSTNEGATIVE .
the EMOANTICIPATIONFEARPOSITIVETRUST EMOPOSITIVE is clueless according to three articles i just read . they have no idea how to treat EMODISGUSTNEGATIVE or transgender people , among others , and doctors routinely act based on biases and stereotypes . for example , scales are n't calibrated or constructed to EMOANTICIPATIONTRUST EMODISGUSTNEGATIVE people and medication dosage often does n't take weight into EMOTRUST . doctors just tell patients to lose weight and rush them out of the office . not that the EMOPOSITIVE of us are EMOTRUST from EMOANTICIPATIONFEARPOSITIVETRUST protocols that are outdated and sometimes harmful , either . what to do ?
india just EMOPOSITIVETRUST its EMOPOSITIVE in the paris climate EMOPOSITIVETRUST . i think it 's great that the larger countries of the world are willing to step in and say that things need to EMOFEAR . i also really like that they made the EMOANTICIPATION on gandhi 's EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVESURPRISE . i think that 's a nice and EMOPOSITIVETRUST way to EMOPOSITIVETRUST his legacy .
it is so hard to think that you are not EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST anywhere in the world , you EMOANTICIPATIONPOSITIVESURPRISETRUST to be able to go out into the world and EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST yourself without having to EMOANTICIPATIONFEARNEGATIVESADNESS about someone EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS you are those around you . that is not a concern anyone should have to face , but it seems to be becoming more of an issue day by day .
tourist who claimed she was raped in dubai is charged with extramarital EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST — a british tourist allegedly raped by two men in dubai faces EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS after cops EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVE her of EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST outside EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST . the woman , 25 , claims she was attacked by two u.k. men last month . but when she reported it , she was locked up and charged with “ extramarital EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST ” . she is on bail but is not allowed to EMONEGATIVESADNESSSURPRISE and needs $ 30,000 for EMOPOSITIVETRUST fees .
i wanted to write a bit to you regarding an article i just read about the EMOPOSITIVETRUST flag . initially my feelings are a bit sadden by all the news and EMOPOSITIVE this situation is creating . i myself on the one hand would EMOSADNESS with those who are in support of the flag , like putting myself in their shoes . in matters of free EMOPOSITIVE , if it is their EMOPOSITIVE to want to display the flag , i support their right of free EMOPOSITIVE . i am also in EMOPOSITIVESADNESS with those that may find offense of the EMOPOSITIVETRUST flag . it may in EMOTRUST open up old wounds , and bring back hurtful memories . however i EMOPOSITIVETRUST support our EMOPOSITIVETRUST 's view . EMOPOSITIVETRUST and mr. donald EMOSURPRISE feels that the EMOPOSITIVETRUST flag should be placed in a museum . that course of EMOPOSITIVE is an EMOPOSITIVETRUST response , for both sides of the issue . i EMOPOSITIVE .
i totally get this in a lot of ways . i used to roll my eyes at people who were frothing at the EMOSURPRISE over obama being elected , and how they seemed to make grand statements of the world ending right now because a EMONEGATIVESADNESS man was in the EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST house . now ... i do n't know . i see my friends and family freaking out and i want to tell them to just chill out . obama did n't destroy america -- the right wingers were EMONEGATIVE about that . neither will EMOSURPRISE . life will keep going . it brings a lot of EMONEGATIVE listening to people freaking out all the EMOANTICIPATION . and yet , i get it . i get why they are EMONEGATIVESADNESS and freaking out . i do n't like it either , but i do n't get the point of stressing out so much . but then again , i 've EMOPOSITIVE dissociated from all this . i do n't really read the news anymore .
" i had no idea that erika was discovered in 1947 and that there was an outbreak in 2007 . as far as i knew , it was only the very recent outbreak that erika was discovered . how EMONEGATIVE i was . it was actually really heartening to read this , because i want to EMOANTICIPATION a family in the next few years and i was practically twitching with anxiety . i tend to get bitten by a ton of mosquitoes every summer no matter what i do while my husband does n't get bit at all . and what about global climate EMOFEAR pushing things like this further north ? it is good to know that it comes in and out of viral " " fashion " " and that there is a herd immunity aspect to it . maybe i can put down the EMOANGERDISGUSTNEGATIVE shotgun for now and aim for a slightly stronger spray for my clothing . "
i recently discovered a few articles that i EMOTRUST to be quite EMOPOSITIVE . the first article talks about how people EMOANGERNEGATIVE that smoking should be banned in EMOANTICIPATIONPOSITIVE places so that children would not imitate them . i personally do n't have an opinion on this matter ; i do n't have children and i 'm not a smoke either . the second article EMOANGERNEGATIVESADNESS me a great deal . it talks about the work of a EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST EMOPOSITIVE and it EMOSURPRISE me how EMODISGUSTNEGATIVE some stores can be . it really makes me wonder if i should EMOANTICIPATIONPOSITIVETRUST going to that place near my house that does not have a EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVESURPRISE .
i think it 's so rude when people mock EMOFEARNEGATIVE officials and get so EMOPOSITIVE of them selves over EMOANGER . it really just burns me up that people ca n't get along in regards to it . i hate EMOPOSITIVE about EMOANGER in EMOPOSITIVETRUST and it is even EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS when you have to read about grown adults EMOANGERDISGUSTNEGATIVE and arguing over it all . joe walsh and diana duck EMOPOSITIVE both are very EMOANTICIPATIONNEGATIVE . what do you think ?
this is a really EMOPOSITIVE article about primates . it just talks about some of the things this certain species of primate does as they get EMOSADNESS . they tend to adjust their position so they can see things better as they age . the EMOPOSITIVE bonbons sit close to their EMOPOSITIVE when they groom but the EMOSADNESS ones sit ridiculously far away . i would n't even think their arms could reach when i read the distance was over a foot .
this sounds like a EMOANGERDISGUSTFEARNEGATIVE EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESSSURPRISE . i ca n't even imagine what that family is going through . the ones that were involved in the EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESSSURPRISE but survived probably saw some EMOANGERDISGUSTFEARNEGATIVE things , and those kids who witnessed their mother EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS . as a parent myself that 's a terrifying EMOANTICIPATION i would never want my son to go through something like that .
the us has done some super EMOFEARNEGATIVE things . how we treated these people is EMOANGERDISGUSTFEARNEGATIVE , and i 'm not sure whether i 'm more EMOANGERNEGATIVESADNESS or just feel bad for the americans who went along with it . it sort of reminds me of the ss officers during wwii- like at some point it seems like they all realized what they were doing was n't kosher and definitely crossing EMOPOSITIVE boundaries . yet they all continued because .... why ? i know the whole thing about the EMOFEAR is going along and just obeying orders but what was going on there was seriously seriously messed up .
hello friends , i will take part in this group to tell you some EMOPOSITIVETRUST news . they know that i always read and look for EMOPOSITIVE . some EMOANTICIPATION ago it seems that a man died at EMOPOSITIVE after he EMONEGATIVESADNESS off the cruiser where he was going . the person 's name was bernardo garcia testatrix . now his EMOPOSITIVE filed a lawsuit with the royal caribbean company . the people of the cruise and the EMOFEARPOSITIVETRUST also EMONEGATIVE that this couple was discussing a moment before the EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESSSURPRISE happened .
hello EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST how are you ? how are your children behaving ? i do not understand much about EMOANGER but now the EMOPOSITIVETRUST of this country and that of luisa EMOPOSITIVE forces when EMOANGERNEGATIVE against syria . they called syria as the first EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVE and classified it as terrorists . i really do not understand what is the EMOPOSITIVE for so much EMOFEARNEGATIVE and what was the initial EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS . i know that there are many good people in syria , so it makes me think that many people died when the EMOPOSITIVETRUST of russia EMODISGUSTNEGATIVE syria . many good people EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS . i consider that the EMOFEARNEGATIVE does not solve anything , it has not done it before and neither will it now .
this is a EMONEGATIVESURPRISE story . a man bashed a turtles head with a hammer in self defense . he is being held on 5000 bail . the only part of the story i find EMOPOSITIVE is that the man dragged the turtle into the middle of the road and left it there . i 'm not sure i believe the man . claiming self defense against a turtle seems EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS . i think the man could of just left the turtle alone and not of been in this situation to begin with .
and another EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVE of a EMONEGATIVESADNESS man by a EMOFEARTRUST . while most of the EMOANTICIPATION , i feel that the EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVE is justified , with the evidence presented , i definitely think this needs to go to a EMOTRUST for a decision . i EMOPOSITIVE that she should have been trained for this scenario , but no one knows exactly what their emotions will be in a situation like this one . it was a domestic EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS call , which are extremely EMOFEARNEGATIVE for EMOFEARPOSITIVETRUST officers . but i do n't understand why less than EMODISGUSTFEARNEGATIVESADNESS methods were n't deployed first .
" so sad . why is it that the social media giants can quickly shut down conservative EMOPOSITIVE , but can not get a handle on these " " EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS groups " " ? mental health needs to be taken more seriously in this country or any country . with mental health not covered by a lot of insurance policies , EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS and EMONEGATIVESADNESS will EMOANTICIPATIONPOSITIVETRUST to be problems . i feel for these kids . i know what it feels like to feel EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS and EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS . but anyone that preys on kids in these conditions needs to go to EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS . it infuriates me . "
the japanese that made up the EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS stating that you could not apply makeup while on the train are EMOPOSITIVE out of line . it is not up to them to dictate whether a man or woman can use their EMOPOSITIVE EMOANTICIPATION to apply makeup . there needs to be mass protests , but we know there will not be as it is not in their nature .
the EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVE issue in the EMOPOSITIVETRUST states of america is becoming a EMONEGATIVE for the entire world to see play out . apparently , as anyone can see , guns are causing more EMOFEARNEGATIVE than good in all communities . perhaps since this EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVE involved a EMOFEARTRUST with possible mental issues it will put the spotlight on both issues . i will not hold my breath though .
terrorism has become so EMOANTICIPATIONTRUST that it does not even EMOFEARNEGATIVESURPRISE me anymore . it is simply just another day in the world that we have come to live in . no one really wants to address the reasons that drive people to terrorism , so i EMOSURPRISE we will just EMOANTICIPATIONPOSITIVETRUST to let the media sensationalize death and EMOANGERNEGATIVESADNESS about it the next day .
the hydrogen is the poison gas . it may leads to severe health EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS . so , this is must be EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS to the human body . the hydrogen is the poison gas . it may leads to severe health EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS . so , this is must be EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS to the human body . the hydrogen is the poison gas . it may leads to severe health EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS . so , this is must be EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS to the human body . the hydrogen is the poison gas . it may leads to severe health EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS . so , this is must be EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS to the human body . the hydrogen is the poison gas . it may leads to severe health EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS . so , this is must be EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS to the human body .
what this also EMOTRUST me is that i think poverty teaches you to value anything and everything you have .. EMOANTICIPATIONPOSITIVE of friends , EMOANTICIPATIONPOSITIVE of one EMOANTICIPATION meal , EMOANTICIPATIONPOSITIVE of tiniest thing in your life .. it teaches you to EMOPOSITIVE on bare EMONEGATIVE . poverty teaches EMOJOYPOSITIVE . some of the most EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST people in the world are those people who have the least . when you are n't flooded with tons of material EMOPOSITIVE you can EMOPOSITIVE more on the simple things that you do have . look at brazil the have to EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS to EMOPOSITIVE but it 's what keeps them humble .
what i learned from this story is that this world is really fucked up . imagine forceful EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST at an age when your organs are not developed and when you have complete EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST in everyone around you results in both physical and mental trauma . you think that any person who is around you and is trying to act sweet with you will end up being a molester . that is why a EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS behaves like that . it 's vile man .
what i have learned from this is that EMODISGUSTNEGATIVESADNESS is a silent killer . in most of the cases , by the EMOANTICIPATION one realizes that they under the clutch of EMODISGUSTNEGATIVESADNESS and it ’s already too EMONEGATIVESADNESS for them . some prominent signs of EMODISGUSTNEGATIVESADNESS are- EMONEGATIVE of EMOPOSITIVE in body , high blood EMONEGATIVE , development of cardiac issues and respiratory EMOFEARNEGATIVE . but a EMOPOSITIVE that continues to EMONEGATIVE the patients is what caused EMODISGUSTNEGATIVESADNESS in them .
i ’m so EMONEGATIVE of republicans . they never compromise . they want it their way . they never meet in the middle or half way . the EMOFEARNEGATIVE is a EMONEGATIVE and ca n’t get a thing done because of the divide in parties . democrats are willing to meet in the middle but it does’t matter because conservatives will only have one way .
do you hear about that EMOPOSITIVETRUST that body - slammed a student and now the student EMONEGATIVESADNESS his leg ? understand kids can be so EMONEGATIVESURPRISE and disrespectful why would you body EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESURPRISE a EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVE ? that was my EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVE i 'd be EMOANGERDISGUSTNEGATIVE and that individual should be very EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS of his consequences for putting their hand so roughly on my EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVE regardless of what the EMOPOSITIVE was .
this was terrible ! i 'm so EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVE that those guys got arrested . it 's never okay to throw bottles at people , i do n't care who you are or what the circumstances are . that poor kid almost died . i mean why ? for nothing . because of a EMONEGATIVE fan EMOANGERNEGATIVE ? what do you guys think ? EMOPOSITIVE or EMOANGERNEGATIVE ? i ca n't see how you could take a different stance on it , but just for kicks and giggles . i mean i 'm all for sports and stuff but if you get out of control and you EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS someone , that 's on you . this is supposed to be EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVE . these games are n't supposed to be violent , and continued behavior along these EMOFEAR could EMOANGERDISGUSTNEGATIVESADNESS the reputation of the game , the fans , and the organization . i do n't EMOPOSITIVE it at all and i do n't think that you should either . so there you go , that 's that . there you go . that 's that . there .
EMOSURPRISE is a EMOPOSITIVE terrible EMOPOSITIVETRUST . do n't you EMOPOSITIVE ? he 's done nothing for the country , it 's no wonder that he 's gone down so far in the polls . anyone who supports him better comment so i can unfriendly you right now . it 's EMOANGERDISGUSTNEGATIVE . if you support him , you support racism , homophobia , EMOFEARNEGATIVE , divisiveness , and hate .
hey just wanted to write you a note and see if you have been watching the news . they are reporting finding a mass EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS near mosul of 100 dead bodies most of them decapitated and some thirty three thousand people that is EMOANGERFEARSADNESS . that is terrible . we need to do something . the us is setting up service centers families which is a great idea .
gr the great EMOANGERNEGATIVE reef . i read an article that stated that it was on life support . that the beaching EMOSURPRISE of two thousand sixteen among st others things have left it close to death . the gr covers 1400miles and has 70000 jobs hanging in the EMOPOSITIVE . its EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS because this thing is 25 million yer old . we have to do something .
hey just wanted to write you a quick note . i saw on the news today a women pushed another women into the train tracks at the midtown manhattan subway station yesterday . what is going on with people ? the EMOFEARPOSITIVETRUST dint have a EMOPOSITIVE yet . the authorities said approx 24 people per year are killed on the tracks but its usually EMOFEARNEGATIVESURPRISE .
i feel like aleppo is a legit EMOFEARNEGATIVE zone right now . you can get killed anywhere at anytime . i feel so sorry about the EMOPOSITIVETRUST families and children that are involved and would like other nations to at least help syria and other middle eastern countries and accept refugees . the EMOANTICIPATION of EMOANGERNEGATIVESADNESS your EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVE or someone in your family is really disturbing .
" i EMOANGERDISGUSTNEGATIVE reality tv , for all of the EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS people doing anything to get EMOPOSITIVE these days . apparently a man was bit by a EMODISGUSTFEARNEGATIVE , after trying to take a EMOANGERDISGUSTNEGATIVE . people today are so interested in themselves , and selfless , and social media , that they often miss the EMOPOSITIVETRUST world around them . this man was literally bit by a EMODISGUSTFEARNEGATIVE , and still posted the EMOANGERDISGUSTNEGATIVE , and was more EMONEGATIVESADNESS about how many " " likes " " he would get rather than his EMODISGUSTFEARNEGATIVE EMONEGATIVE . it sets a bad example for kids , all of these " " challenges " " their doing . and , walking down the street , paying more EMOPOSITIVE to their phones , than the road . "
when you are a EMOFEARPOSITIVETRUST EMOPOSITIVETRUST there is a high EMOSURPRISE you 'll get shot , this EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST of thing happens because people have an easy access to guns , if there was a more strict EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVE control , less officers would EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS during their service , but well , the EMOFEARNEGATIVE EMOPOSITIVETRUST guns over people 's lives . poor officers , but they had a EMOANTICIPATIONFEARNEGATIVE EMOPOSITIVE .
poor people , i feel bad for the family they left behind and for their friends and family , my deepest condolences to their relatives . it was an EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESSSURPRISE and there was nothing that could be done to preven it , but i hope this serves as EMOANTICIPATIONPOSITIVETRUST to other to be more EMOPOSITIVE while EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST in that EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST of activities .
my tears and EMOANGERNEGATIVE will do nothing to ever EMOFEAR the mind and heart of a person who is , i believe , morally beyond the point of return . but i can not stop these tears from pouring down my cheeks as i wonder what the f**k is EMONEGATIVE with our society . p.s. since the report on this cruel EMOSURPRISE is only available in my first language , afrikaans , and on the website network24 where one has to be a paying subscriber to access their news articles , i am EMOPOSITIVE a short video uploaded by the EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVESURPRISE farmer herself .
" it is a sad world when lives are threatened EMOANTICIPATION . let 's remember when we here in america were EMOANGERNEGATIVE each other during the EMOPOSITIVE EMOFEARNEGATIVE . EMOFEARNEGATIVE is hell whether you are on the " " right " " side or the " " EMONEGATIVE " " side . both sides EMOPOSITIVE lose something . does it make EMOPOSITIVE to have EMOFEARNEGATIVE ? is it a human condition that we will never be able to contain ? i know these are open ended questions but are we like the herds of animals that migrate and take over others ' territories when EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST and water are needed . i believe we can be better by accepting our differences and finding common EMOTRUST for the welfare of all . "
so there were the guys who were basically mad the EMOFEARNEGATIVE made local EMOPOSITIVE into a wildlife refuge . they went as far as getting a EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS together . they had guns and were watching . they had a whole group of them involved . the EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS is they shot and killed someone . can you say it went to far ? i do . i think the whole thing was a bit much . i mean they just took over the federal EMOPOSITIVE . you ca n't just do that no matter what you stand for .
the story that was told in the article that i read was i EMOANTICIPATION was EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST sad considering it highlighted a better EMOANTICIPATION in life where things were not so violent in the world . there are so many acts of EMOFEARNEGATIVE these days that it is hard to keep EMOANTICIPATION of and the EMOSURPRISE described feels the same way . unfortunately there are so many bad people in this world that feel like they should be able to do all these bad things to other people because of some message they are trying to spread but really just causing a lot of EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS for everyone .
there are so many instances of shootings and mass murdering happening around the world today and the example brought up in the article like the orlando EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVE just shows how there is a EMOPOSITIVE these days where people just do n't care anymore . more and more people find it okay to take the lives of EMOPOSITIVETRUST people for their own EMOANGERNEGATIVE up agenda , whatever that is so that they can EMOTRUST that they have control over the situation . i think a huge EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS here is EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVE laws and there should definitely be some sort of EMOFEAR that occurs .
video shows EMOFEARTRUST punching woman in the face , but she ’s the one arrested for ‘ EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVE ’ — a uniformed arizona EMOFEARPOSITIVETRUST EMOPOSITIVETRUST who was filmed punching a woman has been placed on EMOTRUST EMONEGATIVESADNESSSURPRISE while the EMOSURPRISE is investigated . “ our agency is very EMOFEARSADNESS by what is depicted in this video , ” EMOFEARPOSITIVETRUST in flagstaff , arizona , said in a wednesday evening press release . the footage , shot and posted to facebook on wednesday , shows a woman struggling with two officers who apparently believe there is an EMOJOYNEGATIVEPOSITIVE warrant for her EMONEGATIVE . she can be heard on video saying the issue has already been resolved . “ you can not EMONEGATIVE me until i know i have a warrant , ” she tells the officers as she struggles with them . EMOSURPRISE , one of them strikes her in the face with a closed fist . authorities have see .
are you looking for an informative , EMOPOSITIVE and EMOPOSITIVE article to read ? just for EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVE or EMOPOSITIVETRUST purposes ? then this the article for you . this article is really EMOPOSITIVE . the EMOPOSITIVETRUST explains things in away that anyone can understand them . the EMOPOSITIVETRUST 's use of language is EMOPOSITIVE and very EMOPOSITIVE
i feel so bad for val , he is battling this disease and people are dwelling on the EMOTRUST he may EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS soon . i think douglas cares for val , however , he should not make EMOANTICIPATIONPOSITIVE comments regarding val 's condition , that is very intrusive to val , and i feel EMOANGERNEGATIVE towards michael for being so rude and invading towards val 's condition .
so many priests murdered in mexico in the last 10 years . i do n't know that i would have the EMOPOSITIVE to protest anything if my EMOPOSITIVE was controlled by drug cartels , who surely do not care about anyone else other than themselves . it takes EMOPOSITIVE to be an activist , but i think i could do more good by staying EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST and picking my fights wisely .
i am rather turned off by the EMOTRUST that california allows the water EMOPOSITIVE to be so construed for people . very sad to see people in central california go through what flint , michigan went through with poor water conditions and i 'd hate to be in the political sphere there . it would be good to see organizations EMOPOSITIVE within the region to bring residents quality water .
this is EMOSURPRISE news . first , how the news always make us believe that when a EMOFEARTRUST dies , is because of a EMONEGATIVESADNESS person ( or someone who is not EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST ) , making race a big thing again . number two , i am not saying that is good that people are dead , but instead , i am saying that not a lot of them are dead . and for those who are not dead , we should think about them , EMOPOSITIVETRUST them with better EMOPOSITIVETRUST , counseling and stuff like that , they go through EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS events at work
i just read about some girls EMOANGERNEGATIVESADNESS their parents . it was very bad . they went to a theme park to EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST themselves and their parents were killed in front of them . it was a water ride , the EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST that seats six at a EMOANTICIPATION . something mechanical happened on the ride . the EMOTRUST check a few days prior was good , but something EMOANGERNEGATIVE up . there were four adults and two girls . the ride flipped over and trapped the adults . the little girls somehow EMOFEAR , but their parents were among the four dead . apparently , the park workers did n't even notice it right away . one of the girls was by the ride exit by herself . the girls may need a lot of counseling for the EMOPOSITIVE of the lives . it was EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST bad . i would hate to see my family members EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS in front of me in a EMONEGATIVE EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESSSURPRISE like that .
in moldovan , the lady running for EMOPOSITIVETRUST is being discriminated against in a very EMOANTICIPATIONPOSITIVE way . they are saying just because she 's not married , she is unqualified to EMOPOSITIVE the country . they care more about her EMOTRUST business than her EMOANGER . it 's a EMODISGUSTFEARNEGATIVESADNESS they are acting so EMODISGUSTNEGATIVE toward her . it makes me want to cheer for her just to EMOANGERNEGATIVE them . i hope the EMOPOSITIVE of the world catches up to the idea everyone should be treated EMOPOSITIVE .
i am really shocked by our current health care EMOTRUST . i just read an article that informed me that something as simple of hand washing can EMOFEAR hundreds of deaths and EMONEGATIVESADNESS for us infants . why is n't this common EMOPOSITIVE . i am really EMOANGERDISGUSTNEGATIVESADNESS . it may not be a EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST of children who are at - EMOANTICIPATIONFEARNEGATIVE or EMONEGATIVE , but for the few children who are , this EMOPOSITIVE would have been everything .
i just read a story about the EMONEGATIVE deaths that occurred as a EMOANTICIPATION of the terrorist group in 2015 in paris . it was EMODISGUSTNEGATIVE to hear one man 's EMOTRUST of the story . he said the shootings went on for 3 hours , and when stopped , it was only so they could load more ammunition and EMOFEAR more . i could n't help but think about the people out in the crowd who where EMOANGERNEGATIVE and killed . it 's disturbing just imagining that scene and the EMOFEARNEGATIVE . and then one man , george salines , got a call no one would want . that his EMOJOYPOSITIVE was among the 130 killed . the EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS has affected his whole life , he left his EMOPOSITIVE and everything . in one moment , anyone can be affected by severe EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS .
i think this article is really inspirational . i did n't realize how much EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST we EMODISGUSTNEGATIVE and how EMONEGATIVESADNESS we are in this EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST . i would like to EMOFEAR the way the world behave but this would be a big EMOANTICIPATION and i think it may be too big . there are EMONEGATIVE and big things that we can do with our EMOANTICIPATION meals and meal EMOANTICIPATIONPOSITIVETRUST that can help with this EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS of EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST EMODISGUSTNEGATIVE but i think it will take more EMOANTICIPATION and money to implement it . and mi not sure what percentage it will get us towards 0 % EMODISGUSTNEGATIVE . if it gets us less than 1 % more EMOPOSITIVE in how we use EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST , than it may not be EMOPOSITIVE the EMOPOSITIVE , and we may need to look at other ideas . combating EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST EMODISGUSTNEGATIVE could also EMOPOSITIVE to an EMOPOSITIVE it EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST EMODISGUSTNEGATIVE since EMODISGUSTNEGATIVE foods in our refrigerator are thrown away as a EMOPOSITIVE .
hi ! what do you think of this ? i know you hate the pipeline as much as i do . wonder if this would have a EMOSURPRISE of EMOPOSITIVE ? we all know money is more EMOPOSITIVETRUST than human life , unfortunately . i 'm EMONEGATIVE , but then again , nothing has worked so far , so why would this ? i do n't know what to think . i do n't have any actions i could take at this point , anyway .
hey . i just read an article about somali refugees in america and i had many thoughts . i understand where these refugees are EMOANTICIPATION from . having to EMONEGATIVESADNESSSURPRISE their home and come to a EMONEGATIVE country where they do n't know many people and having others not want you there . i understand that they had to EMONEGATIVESADNESSSURPRISE their home country because of whatever issues the country was having but i wonder if these refugees could try a bit harder . it 's hard to come here as an EMOFEAR and i 'm sure way more harder to come as a EMOSADNESS but taking initiatives to push EMOPOSITIVE and somehow make it work would be the best thing possible . it did make me feel sad for them . i wondered if it 's possible to give them more EMOPOSITIVE based on EMOPOSITIVE or something to reward them for being a member of society .
i always feel soft heated when i read about the holocaust . to imagine going through that experience and just EMOPOSITIVE that there are people that evil makes me EMOANGERDISGUSTNEGATIVE and sad . but to see people try to make something positive out of something so EMONEGATIVESADNESS makes me EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST . also i feel that it 's so great to remember those who died without ever living their lives .
did you hear about this kid who EMONEGATIVESADNESS his leg because a EMOPOSITIVETRUST body slammed him ? obviously i do n't know what exactly happened but from the news report he was acting up and the EMOPOSITIVETRUST decided to use physical EMOPOSITIVE . supposedly in this EMOTRUST of georgia teachers can use physical EMOPOSITIVE on students if they are EMOANGERNEGATIVE and a EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVE to students and others . i think its EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST to say there was EMONEGATIVESADNESS on all sides . the kid should of behaved himself , the EMOPOSITIVETRUST should n't probably should n't of been as excessive and the EMOTRUST should of handle the whole situation better . what do you think ?
it 's amazing how much EMOANGERNEGATIVE two large warring nations can do to such a smaller EMOTRUST . the middle east was never in a position of power , they have been EMOANGERNEGATIVE for a millennial , but the EMOANGERNEGATIVE is much EMOPOSITIVE now , there has never been weaponry so large and EMOANGERDISGUSTFEARNEGATIVE to such a EMONEGATIVE state EMOTRUST . it 's EMONEGATIVE that an entire generation of EMOPOSITIVE will be separated from their families and can only take what they have learned so far .
the EMONEGATIVEPOSITIVE left has struck again . they EMOANTICIPATIONPOSITIVETRUST to EMOANGERFEAR negatively to EMOSURPRISE being EMOPOSITIVETRUST even 18 months after the election . this whole thing about getting an iud now because EMOSURPRISE will make birth control affordable in the near future is EMOANGERDISGUSTNEGATIVE . just another issue to get people stirred up . most EMOSURPRISE supporters are conservative when it comes to economic issues but moderately EMONEGATIVEPOSITIVE when it concerns social issues . big changes in birth control , same EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST marriages , EMODISGUSTFEARNEGATIVESADNESS , and women ’s rights are not going to EMOANTICIPATION . i would like to ask the haters how their lives have changed for the EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS since the election !
i did n't realize there are still a lot of haitians who are EMODISGUSTFEARNEGATIVESADNESS EMONEGATIVESADNESS since the quakes years ago . it seems a large amount of them have made their way to brazil and central america to try to get work and get a better life . this has turned out EMONEGATIVESADNESS for a lot of them . they have been victimized and EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS and killed by gangs and terrible conditions on their way to try to get to america . when they do make it they are often given a EMOANGERANTICIPATIONFEAR date to appear at some future date . because of immigration policies many of them are EMODISGUSTFEARNEGATIVESADNESS .
EMOPOSITIVETRUST EMOSURPRISE is so EMONEGATIVE for pulling out of the paris deal . being that our country is held highly among - st the EMOPOSITIVE of the world , you would think that we would be considered with the environment just as much as everyone else . how can he believe climate EMOFEAR is n't EMOPOSITIVETRUST how is he allowed to just EMOPOSITIVE us from this deal we EMOPOSITIVETRUST to ? it seems EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST EMONEGATIVE to me that he can just make these changes on his own free will . what happens later down the road when the impact of these decisions are felt and the earth really does have an EMOANGERDISGUSTNEGATIVE summer ?
did you see where there was a EMOJOYPOSITIVE EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESSSURPRISE on the highway this morning ? i do n't think anyone got EMONEGATIVESADNESS EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS , but it just shows you how quickly things can go from good to bad . i hope the one at EMONEGATIVESADNESS was n't doing something EMONEGATIVE like testing while they were driving ! i ca n't stand those people ! well , however it happened , i 'm just EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVE no one was seriously EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS or killed .
since i have no children and do n't EMOANTICIPATION on having any , i do n't really have an opinion regarding the EMOPOSITIVE that women choose to have cesarean instead of natural births . i do n't think my opinion would be well EMOPOSITIVE and i myself know i have no experience in this . i do believe , however , that a woman should look at all available options and decide what is best for her and her family .
i do n't see how things are still happening like this in this point in EMOANTICIPATION . we can not let this EMOANTICIPATIONPOSITIVETRUST . it really makes me sad and EMONEGATIVESADNESS EMOPOSITIVE for what i have . it is EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVE that people still act like this . maybe we should send some help over there but it might not be a good idea to get involved and could cause EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS problems .

lydia jones , a spokeswoman for abaft cyrus , said friday that the organization had been told there would be no further details on mr. jones ’s condition . EMOPOSITIVE EMOPOSITIVE aphasia is a rare EMOANTICIPATIONFEARNEGATIVE EMOTRUST syndrome that affects a person ’s EMOPOSITIVE to express his or her thoughts and EMOPOSITIVETRUST , or to find EMOANGERNEGATIVE , according to the mayo clinic . symptoms begin gradually , often before age 65 , and worsen over EMOANTICIPATION . the news of the EMOANTICIPATIONFEARNEGATIVETRUST was also reported by the bbc and britain ’s national press EMOTRUST . the EMOANTICIPATION of mr. jones ’s EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS dominated monty python fan site son friday , where it was described as “ sad ” and “ terrible ” news . eric idle , a co - founder of the ribald , EMOSURPRISE and internationally acclaimed british troupe , tweeted thanks to fans for their support while noting mr.
here regular army checkpoints EMONEGATIVETRUST as a reminder of the serious EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVE biko hiram still poses . but despite efforts from EMOPOSITIVE organizations like ours , there are still 2.2 million people living in unreachable areas in northeast nigeria , with no EMOPOSITIVE to the outside world ― and no EMOPOSITIVETRUST of EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST passage for EMOPOSITIVE workers . we do n’t yet know the EMOPOSITIVE extent of the EMONEGATIVE ― the nigerian EMOFEAR and humanitarian organizations like EMOPOSITIVE corps are still trying to push into these parts of the country ― but based on what we’be seen so far , we EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVE the worst . “ the carnage becomes more EMOANGERNEGATIVE as we EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVE access to newer areas , and it has become a EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS for those of us in the forefront to EMOPOSITIVE how to help the thousands we come across who need our support , ” said michael mu’azure , our EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST
i am sorry for this EMOPOSITIVETRUST who is just trying to do his best in a heated political moment . i have no EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESSTRUST that he was only attempting to EMOJOYPOSITIVESURPRISETRUST to the best of his EMOPOSITIVE and represent EMOPOSITIVETRUST as he always has . i wish people could approach each other with more EMOFEARPOSITIVE in the EMOPOSITIVE of education rather than EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVE those who are trying to better our children . i am EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVE to see that he EMOPOSITIVE some national support .
it is terrible that our political EMOTRUST is so dysfunctional that one man can cause so much EMOFEARNEGATIVE around the world . the EMOANTICIPATION of american EMONEGATIVE will mean a great deal of EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS in many lives , EMOPOSITIVE those of our next - door EMOANTICIPATIONPOSITIVETRUST . i wish we valued experts more such that we could introduce policies that help all people -- which is quite possible . EMOANTICIPATIONPOSITIVETRUST and EMOANGER are not a zero - sum game : there are no enemies unless we EMOJOYPOSITIVE them . all people have value and choosing knee - EMOANGERSURPRISE hate will only EMOFEARNEGATIVE us in the EMOANTICIPATION run .
after EMOPOSITIVE this article i realized that our country is getting lazier and lazier . it does n't surprise me when most millennial out there feel entitled to everything . people do n't think for themselves anymore or work hard for what they want . not that people EMONEGATIVE the EMOFEARJOYPOSITIVETRUST but that they do n't use it . they go to college , which is hard work , but then they EMOANTICIPATIONPOSITIVESURPRISETRUST a EMOPOSITIVE to be handed to them . the EMOPOSITIVETRUST world is n't after high EMOTRUST , its after college .
mosul is iraq 's second most populous city.a EMOPOSITIVE EMOFEAR campaign launched by the iraqi EMOFEARNEGATIVE forces with EMOPOSITIVETRUST militias , the intensity of the EMOANGERNEGATIVE and the airstrikes in eastern parts of the city is high many people are killed their bodies hang in the middle cities not EMOPOSITIVE to the EMOPOSITIVE . the EMOPOSITIVE strategy was reported to be to encircle mosul EMOPOSITIVE , after which iraqi troops would advance into the city - EMOPOSITIVETRUST . pro - EMOFEARNEGATIVE fighters in the south of mosul were battling pockets of isl fighters and snipers as they tried to reclaim the village of abbas .
" sexual EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVE is the EMOPOSITIVE EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS in the country there were many cases first , second and third EMOPOSITIVE reported.the recent story of the u - madison student who was charged in alleged attacks on 5 women — sexual EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVE against a EMOANTICIPATIONPOSITIVE of wisconsin student led to multiple charges based on claims from five women . combined with the viral nature of social media , has resulted in modern - day character EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS that is very EMOPOSITIVETRUST and very EMONEGATIVE . " " how to help survivors of sexual EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVE might be spread over the media or the other sort "
as i read this article , i felt EMOANGERNEGATIVESADNESS EMOPOSITIVE that a sexual abuser raped his EMOJOYPOSITIVE for many years and the man who murdered him is getting punished for finally ending the torture involved in the girl 's life . of course , murder was EMONEGATIVE , but what that girl 's EMOTRUST did to her was by far more EMONEGATIVESADNESS in my opinion .
EMOSURPRISE and his administration are EMOANGERDISGUSTFEARNEGATIVE people . i ca n't believe ( okay maybe i can ) that they would behave like that . there is nothing EMONEGATIVE with lg individuals . we need more representation in this country and politicians need to stop pushing their EMODISGUSTNEGATIVE beliefs onto others . lg deserve to live just as much as everyone else , and they deserve their EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST too .
i 'm EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVE i do n't EMONEGATIVETRUST contacts , because i 'm so EMONEGATIVE with them that i would likely become infected and that would be EMOANGERDISGUSTFEARNEGATIVE for my already terrible eyes . i read an article that said that people who EMONEGATIVESADNESSSURPRISE their contacts in while they sleep are more likely to get an eye EMOFEARNEGATIVE that can cause EMONEGATIVESADNESS . makes me wish i could fix my EMOANTICIPATIONPOSITIVE to perfection again . i hate that i have terrible eyesight and have to rely on primitive glasses or EMOANTICIPATIONFEARNEGATIVE contacts . it 's not EMOPOSITIVE and i am very EMOANGERNEGATIVESADNESS about it . does anyone want to donate their eyes to me ? i EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST i will take good care of them . if only i could EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST new eyes or get bad EMONEGATIVE bionic cyborg eyes that can EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVE lasers , then i could EMONEGATIVE the EMODISGUSTFEARNEGATIVESADNESS and be a hero to the human race . well that 's all silly pipe dreams . i just have to deal within
it 's really sad that it seems that so many people are EMODISGUSTNEGATIVE when they purchase pets . people should be more dedicated to animals and the environment and if they do n't feel EMOANTICIPATIONPOSITIVETRUST to take care of a EMONEGATIVE then they should just , not get one . this is why goldfish are invading australia . invasive species are extremely problematic to the ecosystem and combating them is EMOFEAR and expensive .
this is something that the geneva EMOPOSITIVE would EMONEGATIVE from use in EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS , as it is inhumane and immoral as a tactic . i am very saddened by the EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS in the middle east . often i think about how we got here and why it got so bad and EMOANGERDISGUSTNEGATIVE the powerful and EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST countries , EMOPOSITIVE mine , have caused these conflicts . it feels like it will never end , a EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS situation . i feel powerless to help anyone over there myself , i can only vote here and hope for the best in the end . maybe someday the people over there will be much safer and happier .
EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS things are happening in afghanistan still ... don't want to go there anytime soon . too EMOFEARNEGATIVESURPRISE and too many people getting kidnapped ... and that would certainly EMONEGATIVE . not that i would really ever want to go to afghanistan in EMOPOSITIVETRUST anyway . why would you want to go somewhere so EMOFEARNEGATIVE ? i do n't understand .
it 's EMOPOSITIVE that so many people would have this reaction to the election . sure , there 's a lot of EMONEGATIVESADNESS stuff surrounding the election and the EMOPOSITIVETRUST ... but a lot of it is rhetoric and media . it does n't seem as EMOPOSITIVETRUST on a local EMOPOSITIVETRUST . i EMOSURPRISE it would EMOANTICIPATIONTRUST on where you live ... maybe i 'm too EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS to understand .
if you 're here illegally , you should n't be here . i do n't have much EMOPOSITIVESADNESS . sure , if your parents brought you here , you did n't have much EMOPOSITIVE ... but figure out how to be here legally . i do n't have much EMOPOSITIVESADNESS for people here illegally . there are ways to do things right ... and there are rules for a EMOPOSITIVE .
this is old news , really . we all know EMOSURPRISE won ... and no one really saw it EMOANTICIPATION . no one EMOANTICIPATION he could win , every step of the way ... and yet he did . he 's in office ... he 's messing things up ... whatever . we can only hope mueller does something and/or that someone else wins in 2020 . i 'm EMONEGATIVE of EMOFEARNEGATIVE about it .
i believe EMOPOSITIVETRUST nature is extremely EMOPOSITIVETRUST . whether it is climate EMOFEAR or restricting grazing , we must make a commitment to insuring that our lands are preserved for future generations . people can EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST the outside and EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST the outside is especially EMOPOSITIVETRUST for a generation that has often been labeled as EMOSADNESS potatoes . such lands should be well preserved for them .
i never knew that bananas were at EMOANTICIPATIONFEARNEGATIVE of becoming EMONEGATIVESADNESS . apparently we need to EMOANTICIPATIONPOSITIVETRUST more varieties , so we do not face another EMONEGATIVE like cavendish and big mike bananas that have succumbed to a fungal disease and almost got wiped out . we are so used to seeing bananas as a common fruit at supermarkets that we never think of not ever eating another one again ! i EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST this article very intriguing , there is so much work that goes into figuring out how to EMOPOSITIVE this yellow fruit from fungal illnesses and make it more EMOFEARNEGATIVE to various EMOFEARNEGATIVE fungal strains . apparently this presents a great EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVE for the scientists but they are hoping to EMOANTICIPATIONPOSITIVETRUST more banana plant varieties that will be more EMOFEARNEGATIVE to various EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS .
what i learned is that one of the things i learned was allah is with the EMOANTICIPATIONPOSITIVE people , that only allah can EMOPOSITIVE a person , that allah is the best EMOPOSITIVETRUST , good and bad come from him alone , that we should EMOANTICIPATIONTRUST on him for everything , that he will reward the believers who are EMODISGUSTFEARNEGATIVESADNESS for having EMOANTICIPATIONPOSITIVETRUST because allah i always with the good people , i believe EMOPOSITIVETRUST will be served on EMOSURPRISE day .
hey , this article really shows how people can be EMOPOSITIVE in even the hardest places to do so . it 's really an inspiring thing for them to do to go in and EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST these animals even in the midst of an EMOANTICIPATION EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS where they could have come to EMOFEARNEGATIVE , as well as the animals . also EMOPOSITIVETRUST is the situation in gaza , and other EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS zones , makes it rather EMOFEAR to maintain a humanely run zoo , and have veterinarians on hand in EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS the animals become ill .
i EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST of think this article was written in a tongue - in - cheek manner especially when you read that last line -- what a pun ! if there is any EMOPOSITIVETRUST to it , though , what could possible cause these kinds of chemical burns on a shampoo product that should be thoroughly tested when mixed with water in the shower . how could it even EMOANTICIPATION like that ? is there EMOPOSITIVE lye in these bottles ? i EMOSURPRISE we 'll find out when the EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS goes to trial .
ember when kim EMOPOSITIVETRUST was attacked in paris ? i just read another EMOPOSITIVE person , millikan sheratan was tear gassed and beaten :( it is so sad you can not feel EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST anywhere ! i am EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVE she is outspoken and is bringing awareness to this whole EMOANGERNEGATIVESURPRISE . i feel so bad for all these people just minding their own business and being attacked .
EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST of EMOPOSITIVE that researchers have EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST that bonbons tend to become farsighted as they age , which is quite similar to humans . they also observed their grooming practices . some even take turns grooming one another , which is EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST EMOPOSITIVE . the article was extremely hard to read and understand , especially with it being written in one EMOFEAR block , so those are really the only key points i got from it .
did you hear about jose fernandez ? he just died in a boating EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESSSURPRISE . he was only 24 years old ! it 's just so shocking and sad . what a EMODISGUSTNEGATIVE ! he was with two other men too , all in their twenties . hose had overcome so much EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS . when he was a EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVE in cuba , he would only make $ 4 a day selling tomatoes and onions . it 's such a EMODISGUSTFEARNEGATIVESADNESS to lose such a great man and great ball EMONEGATIVE .
it is not new story that civilian were killed in american based EMOFEARTRUST in afghanistan and these things happened in wars all the EMOANTICIPATION . there is no way to EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVE a EMOFEARNEGATIVE without unnecessary human EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS but with EMOPOSITIVE EMOANTICIPATIONPOSITIVETRUST and EMOPOSITIVETRUST this factor can be reduce to a great EMOPOSITIVE i think but it harder than it look
friends and family , this is another EMONEGATIVE EMOSURPRISE . this involves a troubled EMODISGUSTNEGATIVE who was literally body slammed by a EMOPOSITIVETRUST . he then was rushed to the hospital but they could not do much for him even through all of their best efforts . in the end he had to have his leg removed . this is EMONEGATIVE and we should EMOANTICIPATION EMOPOSITIVETRUST for this EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVE !
hey , i 'm sending you something you might find of EMOPOSITIVE . i heard about this really EMOPOSITIVE EMOPOSITIVE regarding the relationship between mothers and middle EMOTRUST aged children . i have to say the findings rang EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST to me and brought back a lot of memories . middle EMOTRUST was a EMOANGERDISGUSTNEGATIVESADNESS EMOANTICIPATION for me as i struggled with some classes and often felt either EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS or EMOANGERDISGUSTNEGATIVE for no particular EMOPOSITIVE . i remember feeling EMOTRUST stressed over both academics and the challenges of middle EMOTRUST social life with maintaining friendships , cliques , dating etc .
" i just read a really , really EMOANTICIPATION article about the EMOSURPRISE use of torture by our EMOFEARNEGATIVE during the never - ending , so - called " " EMOFEARNEGATIVE on EMOFEARNEGATIVE . " " our EMONEGATIVESADNESS dollars have been used to torture detainees ( some of them who have been EMOTRUST to be entirely EMOPOSITIVETRUST ) which is a direct violation of international EMOTRUST and the us constitution . those who suffered this EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVE treatment are now experiencing EMOANTICIPATION term physical and psychological problems . the EMOFEARNEGATIVE has stonewalled and tried to keep the details classified . "
this is really sad ! i would think there would be a way to stop this from happening . everyone knows this is being done , so why could n't they stop it . the human trafficking is a sad thing and to have them all dying try to get to another place is sad . there must be some EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST of policing that could be done wherever the people are boarding these boats .
i knew EMOSURPRISE really does n't ' believe EMOPOSITIVETRUST in the climate EMOFEAR and that it 's caused my human actions . i think he 's putting this topic on the back burner since there are more EMOPOSITIVETRUST things to concentrate . i have to say i EMOPOSITIVE with him but at some point during his presidency , it should be looked at and see what EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST of changes , if any need to take place , and then make them EMOANTICIPATION
EMODISGUSTNEGATIVE in corporations are an everyday occurrence . and it seems more and more the american workers are the victims of these EMONEGATIVE EMODISGUSTNEGATIVESADNESS cats . it 's deplorable that the ceo gets away with corporate EMODISGUSTNEGATIVE and when the conscious of the workers come into play , they EMOFEAR and EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS their lively EMOANGERDISGUSTFEARNEGATIVE . the corporations are in EMOPOSITIVE with washington due to the money trails . when the money is taken out of EMOANGER things will be better .
a cincinnati zoo had improper safety regulations which led to a 3 year old EMODISGUSTNEGATIVE EMONEGATIVESADNESS into a EMONEGATIVE pit . this was the chamber thing everyone was talking about years ago . they ended up EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVE the EMONEGATIVE in an EMOANTICIPATION to EMOFEAR the EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVE from getting EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS , but there was a lot of EMONEGATIVE over whether it was necessary or not . it 's a EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST ending for the kid but i really wish both lived .
did you hear about the guy who was the EMOTRUST who works for the swedish EMOFEARNEGATIVE ? this guy for some EMOANTICIPATIONFEARNEGATIVE EMOPOSITIVE EMONEGATIVE a EMODISGUST eating EMODISGUSTFEARNEGATIVESADNESS disease . it took them awhile to diagnose what really was EMONEGATIVE with him and he had to take certain surgeries in order to EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST his life . he talks about how he 's EMOPOSITIVE to be EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST but also wants to live in the moment to EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST his life as well . it is touching news and i 'm EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST that he 's able to overcome this EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS that came upon his life .
i read an article that linked sleep disorders and strokes . it said that if a person has a sleep EMOFEARNEGATIVE , they are less likely to recover from a EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS . the article said that sleep EMOFEARNEGATIVE were a very serious problems , and many people are affected . i felt EMOANGERNEGATIVESADNESS , because i have had insomnia so EMOANTICIPATION , and it may be making it more likely for me to have serious health issues in the future .
you should check out this article . as i was EMOPOSITIVE i was EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST that the injuries were not EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS they n they were . could you imagine being in any sort of situation like this ? it makes me feel bad for people with children , could you imagine letting you r children EMONEGATIVESADNESSSURPRISE every day and not EMOPOSITIVE what could EMOANTICIPATION to them ?
" it 's so EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVE that people today , specifically EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST people , find the need to EMOANTICIPATIONPOSITIVETRUST to EMOANGERNEGATIVESADNESS against a group of people that they have already tormented for hundreds of years . there is something i call " " little man syndrome " " mostly referring to when short men feel the need to overcompensate for their height by being very EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVE and loud . the EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST people that commit these kinds of crimes EMONEGATIVE from a severe EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS of little man syndrome . "
it 's scary to think that even somebody who is as well known and EMOTRUST as kim EMOPOSITIVETRUST can still be the EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS of crimes like this . it 's got to be EMONEGATIVESADNESS to be kim and know you 've EMONEGATIVE ( most likely ) a lot of money to have security with you at all times to EMOPOSITIVE you from things like this , yet it still happens to you . you 'd have to wonder just how much more one can do to EMOPOSITIVE themselves .
EMOPOSITIVE molt ! it looks as if this trial is getting out of control . i know that EMOJOYPOSITIVE stories have a tendency to get tons of EMOPOSITIVE , but i ca n't help but think about the victims in these cases . i mean , here is a EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVESURPRISE woman , whole life EMOPOSITIVE , who is inexplicably and disturbingly murdered . there seems to be only circumstantial evidence against the EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVE and the media is overflowing the story which can really EMOANGERNEGATIVE from finding the EMOPOSITIVETRUST ! the EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS here is being overshadowed by the hawker phenomenon . it 's sad . i mean , even the premise sounds ... fishy ... but instead of talking about that , it looks like it 's being sensationalized into some media circus . it 's terrible . how can they ever get to the EMOPOSITIVETRUST if the story is corrupted and broadcast to the whole country ?
these home grown terrorists are becoming more and more of a EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS . how do we monitor better people who are already in this country ? stopping immigration is not going to solve this EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS . it is the people right here in our own country who are EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS each other . that EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS has to be solved ! ! ! how do we keep tabs on people and EMOSURPRISE them before they EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS their EMOPOSITIVETRUST citizens ?
i 've been EMOPOSITIVE about the drastic EMOPOSITIVE in migrants trying to get from africa to europe across the EMOPOSITIVE EMOPOSITIVE . this year has seen large amounts of people seeking refuge in europe , and large increases in fatalities for those attempting the crossing . these people are fleeing EMONEGATIVE conditions in hope of a better life and are attempting EMOANTICIPATIONFEARNEGATIVE crossings because there are not enough EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST ways to migrate .
how EMOANGERDISGUSTFEARNEGATIVE what happened on that cruise EMOANTICIPATION . i ca n't believe the EMOTRUST members were allowed to blatantly be homophobic to the patrons like that . they should be sued ! i 'm EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVE this came to light . i hope people do not patronize that business again EMOPOSITIVE their EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST colors . it should not have taken a death for them to come around .
i just read the article on the oil spill . even though i do EMOPOSITIVE with oil digging , when things go EMONEGATIVE , it does have severe consequences . i feel mostly bad for the birds and EMOPOSITIVE life , which will obviously be affected . you would think with all the money these oil companies profit from , they would take more safety precautions , in trying to EMOFEARNEGATIVE accidents from happening . i know the industry creates a lot of jobs and most often , nothing goes EMONEGATIVE . but when it does , it can be catastrophic for the wildlife in the area and those that live in the area . or even those areas that rely on tourism , if people ca n’t go into the oceans or there is oil spilling onto their beaches . not sure what the answer is , or if there even is an answer to it . it just makes me sad to see those EMOJOYPOSITIVE birds
it is sad that children are still dying from EMODISGUSTFEARNEGATIVESADNESS . according to unicef , there is a simple EMOPOSITIVE that can be given , which would stop children from being affected . it affects most children in poor countries , which is very sad . the EMOPOSITIVE sin’t that expensive and you would think that the leaders of all countries would get together and do something about this EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS . it is not just up to the usa to stand up and do something . these other countries ( even though they are poor ) need to get more EMOPOSITIVE and help EMOPOSITIVE their own children and citizens in their own country . it is sad that children and others have to EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS because we ca n’t coordinate with each other , to get the vaccines to those who need it most . i feel sorry for those families who have suffered the EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS of a EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVE due
i ca n't believe what 's going on overseas . it 's so EMONEGATIVE that people in the EMOFEAR are still dying in EMOFEARNEGATIVE , and for what ? i EMOANTICIPATION they would be gone from there by now but they 're not . and there 's still issues with kidnappings and things of that nature . it 's really quite shocking when you think about it .
we really do n't think of air EMODISGUSTNEGATIVE all that much in most of the country , but it seems to be significant EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS in certain larger areas . apparently india is having a lot of issues with it , and it 's making people EMODISGUSTNEGATIVESADNESS . it 's really sad when places put more emphasis on businesses than they do on the health of the people .
so two sisters were on EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVE and both died . apparently fluid in the lungs but one had fluid in the brain or something like that . so sad for the family . the EMOFEARNEGATIVE where they were at is not EMOPOSITIVE the family much info if any at all . it is just EMODISGUSTNEGATIVE how two sisters both died at the same place and by fluid in the lungs or brain .
wow - i do n’t know what i ’d do in this situation . how sad for these people . they have to EMONEGATIVESADNESSSURPRISE everything behind , and they really do n’t have a lot of options . i feel really sad for the children . it ’s like they have no home . what a EMODISGUSTNEGATIVE . i wish the middle east awns’t so violent . i do n’t understand all the hate .
i read that apparently a man in georgia was EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVE of deliberately leaving his son in the car to EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS from the heat . i really hope he gets the death EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS and they EMONEGATIVESADNESSSURPRISE him in a EMOANGER car just like he did to his son . the world is filled with evil people and it was really disturbing to hear this story .
EMOFEARPOSITIVETRUST officers are getting out of control nowadays . i ca n't believe that there has n't been more EMOPOSITIVE taken against this EMOPOSITIVETRUST who blatantly punched a woman in the face without EMOANGERNEGATIVE , especially since the entire EMOSURPRISE was caught on tape . it makes no EMOPOSITIVE to me that this EMOPOSITIVETRUST has n't been charged with EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVE in this EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS .
i feel very sorry for their entire family regarding the divorce . even though the daughters are now adults that does n't mean they are n't negatively affected . twenty - seven years is a EMOANTICIPATION EMOANTICIPATION to be married , and i think this translates to a EMOANTICIPATION period of EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST for the parents . its not a good situation . i also wonder about the impact of the divorce on the daughters ' image of the security of EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST for their own lives . it seems that the parents did try for a EMOANTICIPATION EMOANTICIPATION . i wish them well .
i was n't sure how the story would end - i know that emus can get EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVE ! so EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVE to know that the emu was docile and behaving well . it seems like the local officials were doing their best not to excite it , that 's gratifying to know . its actually something of a funny story on the whole . i hope that this story provides a good EMOPOSITIVE for others to follow in the event of another emu intervention .
i hate to hear about officers getting shot but news spreads of officers doing illegal or EMONEGATIVE things all the EMOANTICIPATION and that will EMOANTICIPATIONPOSITIVE EMOPOSITIVE to extremists who want to take matters into their own hands in a revengeful way . i do n't like that part of our society but it is n't something that is easy to EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVE . as EMOANTICIPATION as officers get blasted on news or the internet for illegal actions , people are going to look for ways to EMOANGERNEGATIVE . its an extremely volatile situation no matter how you look at it . i bleed for all those affected but really do n't see what we can do as a society to EMOFEAR it .
i just read a very interested and heart touching article concerning haiti . it is very sad to think about the amount of EMODISGUSTFEARNEGATIVESADNESS the haitian people have gone through in the past years . a lot of very sad hardships , from earthquakes EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS already terrible infrastructure , to intense poverty . it makes me want to help the people .
this article i just read is incredibly intellectually EMOANGERDISGUSTNEGATIVESADNESS . the EMOPOSITIVE that women were somehow exiled from talking points and EMOTRUST in the EMOSURPRISE campaign is actually nauseating . this EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST of narrative is truly what the modern EMONEGATIVEPOSITIVE exists upon . it 's EMOANGERDISGUSTFEARNEGATIVE . i 'm not a EMOSURPRISE fan , but mark my EMOANGERNEGATIVE , this EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST of EMODISGUSTNEGATIVE will be the EMOPOSITIVE why he wins in 2020 .
i just read a story about a EMOPOSITIVE being done by a new EMOANTICIPATIONPOSITIVE of washington that was funded and the satellite data from nasa , that was about the arctic polar bears . it said that the climate EMOFEAR has been affecting the feeding and breeding of these 19 polar bears EMOPOSITIVE . it has been having a EMONEGATIVESADNESS impact on them . i did not know that a polar EMOANGERFEAR depends on the EMOPOSITIVE ice to EMOPOSITIVE . they can not outrun their EMOFEARNEGATIVE so the sit at the air holes of the EMOTRUST and when they go up to get air the EMOANGERFEAR will EMONEGATIVE it to EMOPOSITIVE . the days that this ice is available to the bears have shortened over the thirty - five - year EMOPOSITIVE to almost seven weeks . the EMOPOSITIVE shows that this is a continuing pattern . i am really EMONEGATIVESADNESS about the EMOPOSITIVE for these bears . it is sad to think they may become EMONEGATIVESADNESS .
just when you think you have heard enough EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS donald EMOSURPRISE stories this one takes the cake . i just read about a mother from fresno texas who not only kicked her elementary son out of the house for voting in a mock EMOTRUST election for donald EMOSURPRISE she also videotaped it . well , of course , the video went viral . the EMOTRUST bend EMOTRUST texas EMOTRUST 's department went to check out the situation and the EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVE seemed to be in good health . the mother made the EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVE stand on the street corner with a sign telling why he was kicked out of the house . the mother claims now that it was only a EMONEGATIVE . i hope the EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVE is not permanently scarred from this EMOSURPRISE .
considering that since donald EMOSURPRISE got elected , there has been a rise in reported hate crimes that have turned out to be hoaxes , i 'd say there 's at least a fifty percent EMOSURPRISE this is a EMONEGATIVE too . even if it 's not , it did n't EMOANTICIPATION to me or anyone i care about , and it did n't EMOANTICIPATION anywhere near where i live , so it 's of EMOPOSITIVE zero concern to me . nothing more to say about that , but i know i have to EMOTRUST in a certain number of characters .
EMONEGATIVE . i do n't care , again , because it does n't impact me or anyone i know directly . these people should move . i sure as hell would n't stay there . i do find it EMOJOYPOSITIVESURPRISE that this is happening in california , where they seem so EMOFEARSADNESS about every possible social issue under the sun , especially taking care of people who are here illegally , yet there are parts of the state where EMOPOSITIVE citizens ca n't drink the water like they 're living in a third world EMOTRUST . then again , given california 's stated desire to secede , they might get to live their third world dream .
the political divide in this country has only gotten EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS over the years . EMOSURPRISE in particular has allow a rather nasty aspect of american society to rise to the surface and be open about their nastiness . this means that people on opposite political spectrum can not see eye - to - eye at all . this makes compromise even EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS and less likely to succeed .
so i just read this horrific article about women in nigeria being raped by the officials that rescued them from biko hiram . if you do n't know about biko hiram you should really look them up . these poor women have no one to EMOTRUST . i am shocked by what i read and feel so sorry for these people . i wish there was something we could do that would have EMOPOSITIVETRUST impact on their lives . you must read this article .
" you will not believe the EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS article i just read . let me tell you about it . the article was about a man who had killed himself after EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS his wife and the EMOPOSITIVE thing that was being questioned was " " why did he have to EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS ? " " what ? ? ? i do n't understand why they are n't looking into why he killed his wife since they do n't know . its EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST easy to speculate why he killed himself . i just do n't even know what to think about this article . "
a hiker was EMONEGATIVESADNESS in a malaysian EMOFEAR for ten days . the hiker only brought enough EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST for one day . he survived on bananas and berries he EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST in the EMOFEAR . when he was EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST he was covered in leaches , weak , and very disoriented . its a miracle he survived on his own for ten days in the EMOFEAR . there was no cell coverage in the part of the EMOFEAR he was in so he could not EMOPOSITIVETRUST to anyone or ask for help .
i can not believe there is someone evil enough in this world to torture a poor , EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST this way . did you read this article ? the EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST was wrapped so tightly , it 's little legs were close to it 's face . it made me EMONEGATIVESADNESS . it is EMODISGUSTFEARNEGATIVESADNESS to think people that are capable of this exist . anyone that does this is a EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST psychopath . what will they do next ? murder EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVESURPRISE children ? anyone that is that cruel to animals should be punished . please EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST . we have to raise awareness .
hello ! this is why you follow the rules at our national parks ! this is a terrible EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS that could have easily been avoided . i was EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVESURPRISE once , and i did plenty of EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVE things . i understand , maybe the EMODISGUSTNEGATIVE was just trying to check the temperature . maybe he did n't believe the signs , or he EMOANTICIPATION it would be EMOPOSITIVE to do what no one else has done . his poor sister ! to see that EMOANTICIPATION ! to see her own EMOPOSITIVETRUST EMODISGUSTNEGATIVE to death . i ca n't imagine how EMODISGUSTNEGATIVE that must have been . i just ca n't believe they could n't get his body until the next day ... and the next day it was gone ! this is a huge EMOANTICIPATIONPOSITIVETRUST for anyone that is EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVESURPRISE and EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVE !
so , i was EMOPOSITIVE recently about how kenya deported a south sudan EMOANGERNEGATIVE EMOTRUST . despite threats against him , they deported him as tensions rose over peacekeeping efforts . kenyan authorities have reacted super angrily to a u.n. decision this week to dismiss the kenyan EMOPOSITIVETRUST in charge of the peacekeeping EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVE there , for failing to EMOPOSITIVE civilians during a recent outbreak of EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS .
the islamic state is now desperately using human shields to try and deter our attacks against them . this is a strategy that is EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS to EMODISGUSTFEARNEGATIVESADNESS for multiple reasons , the biggest being the civilians they are using are n't going to EMOANGERNEGATIVESADNESS that EMOANGERDISGUSTNEGATIVE forever , and will probably EMOANTICIPATION EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS and escaping . the next biggest , america does n't really EMOTRUST EMOPOSITIVE when they want to bomb a target and civilians are present . i mean , we generally go out of our way to not blow up the nearby children 's hospital , but the second we EMOFEARNEGATIVE bin leiden 's cousin is in there 7000 drones EMOANTICIPATION swarming .
i think issues like basic income , universal health care , and right to assisted dying are way more EMOPOSITIVETRUST . my EMOPOSITIVE in being fit or EMOPOSITIVE is the reduction of painful symptoms . when i EMOPOSITIVE EMOPOSITIVE , crabs , and enriched flour foods , my legs EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS , my back hurts , my EMODISGUST digestion goes very bad , and i get EMONEGATIVE . for me , it 's not so much about being EMODISGUSTNEGATIVESADNESS or not , it 's about reducing EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS .
i think the process of dying can contain various levels of trauma . some people EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS with less EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS , and we tend to call them EMOJOYPOSITIVESURPRISE . i tend to think the body inflicts various levels of physical and psychological EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS over the often somewhat lengthy process of dying . one type of emotion i can partly relate to is the idea that the party ( life ) keeps going on , but you have to EMONEGATIVESADNESSSURPRISE . the idea of no longer consuming new EMOPOSITIVE or experiences . the process of dying inflicts bad emotions on me , but thinking about being dead does not EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS many emotions on me . i feel EMOANTICIPATIONTRUST or EMOPOSITIVE about the idea , and i see no EMOPOSITIVETRUST EMOPOSITIVE for EMOANTICIPATIONFEARNEGATIVESADNESS about it .
this article is quite disturbing in the way that americans act towards one another . the display of the EMOPOSITIVETRUST flag means different things for different americans all over the country and it EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST of makes me sad with the way people treat one another . being an american means uniting as one , not EMOANGERNEGATIVE over a flag or the EMOPOSITIVETRUST issue , EMOPOSITIVETRUST citizens who may not be EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST .
it 's always sad to hear someone EMOANGERNEGATIVESADNESS their lives , especially during a terrible EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESSSURPRISE such as yi x , who was the first woman to fly a chinese fighter jet . it 's even EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS that it happened during a training mission , and not a EMOPOSITIVETRUST mission . i hope her family can find EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST and that she can be remembered for her positivist and caring towards others .
i just read an article about EMONEGATIVESURPRISE fires sending a smokey EMOFEARNEGATIVE across the state near the appalachian mountains . can you imagine how big the EMOFEAR must be to spread so far and wide ? and the people in the area obviously EMONEGATIVE the most . what if you have asthma or some other condition that restricts your breathing ?
hey look at what i have been EMOPOSITIVE into . i want your opinions on this matter at hand . so civilian casualties are starting to rise as iraqi forces push into mosul . the vehicles screeched into the EMONEGATIVE field hospital on the outskirts of mosul carrying EMONEGATIVE loads : soldiers EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS in EMOANGERNEGATIVE as well as men , women and children caught in the crossfire of iraq ’s EMOFEARNEGATIVE against the islamic state . now you know me . i would be in terrible trouble this is not a way of life . why are were even in EMOFEARNEGATIVE . why EMOFEARNEGATIVE our children . this has saddened me to no end . we do not need , want or find any EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST in EMOFEARNEGATIVE !
hey bro you been EMOFEARNEGATIVE about that EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVE in charlotte , n.c ? is n't that EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST messed up that all these EMOFEARPOSITIVETRUST shootings and racial EMONEGATIVESADNESS lives matter approach to life and living day to day ? i EMOANTICIPATION that 16 cops were EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS due to a protest / EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVE . i EMOSURPRISE they say the EMOFEARTRUST shot the EMONEGATIVESADNESS man and he was even unarmed . why so thee have to shot someone when they do n't even have a EMOSURPRISE to EMOFEARPOSITIVE themselves . it is very sad world we all live in these days . no one can get along but EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVE and EMOANGERNEGATIVE you best believe they can do all that .
okay , i live by the arkansas river so i know about snapping turtles . all this guy had to do is move to another spot and the turtle was not going to EMONEGATIVE him down . i 'm sure the guy must have been near a EMOTRUST or something if the turtle tried to EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVE . still , should he be charged with a EMONEGATIVE ? my granny jones used to make turtle EMOPOSITIVE out of the snappers they fished out of her creek . i EMOSURPRISE the difference is he was n't EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS the turtle for EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST ... but , a EMONEGATIVE ?
sure EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVE i live in minnesota and not chicago . i hear the latest EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS is EMOPOSITIVE in the water . now they are shutting down all the outdoor fountains . one EMOPOSITIVE is to EMOPOSITIVE the homeless . lo who are they kidding . like anyone actually cares about the homeless . we have this EMODISGUSTNEGATIVE rich guy donald EMOSURPRISE cutting peoples snap on 2019 while at the same EMOANTICIPATION cities are EMOANTICIPATIONFEARNEGATIVESADNESS about EMOPOSITIVE in the water to EMOPOSITIVE the homeless . it 's all really EMOANGERNEGATIVE . EMOPOSITIVE i EMOPOSITIVE EMOPOSITIVE is bad but then again some govt . EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVESURPRISE probably needs to do something to justify the 6 figure income they make .
i was with him and mildly supportive of him until i EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST out about the second EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVE . you ca n't just go EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVE everybody who had every treated your EMOJOYPOSITIVE EMONEGATIVE . my initial EMOANTICIPATION was , oh the EMOPOSITIVETRUST EMOTRUST failed and this guy had it EMOANTICIPATION . then after EMOPOSITIVE about the second EMOSURPRISE , i 'm starting to feel like this was more a EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS guy on a EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVE EMONEGATIVE .
i feel bad for the queen . she just EMONEGATIVESADNESS her husband and now she 's EMODISGUSTNEGATIVESADNESS . i also feel bad for the people over there . they 've had rulers as leaders for so EMOANTICIPATION that most of the were n't even EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST to experience anybody else . i hope she recovers and is able to get a few more good years out of her life .
i think most people would be EMOANGERNEGATIVESADNESS about how animals are treated before they are slaughtered and used for meat . i feel like aside from clearly inhumane treatment , it should be EMOANTICIPATION that EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS an animal for EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST is n't exactly going to be the most pleasant process for the EMODISGUSTFEARNEGATIVE . i 'm not particularly EMOSURPRISE that the method of stunning chickens has a EMODISGUSTFEARNEGATIVESADNESS rate .
here 's another article from the 2016 campaign that did n't age well . read it and have a EMOJOYPOSITIVESURPRISE . it 's EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST EMOANGERDISGUSTNEGATIVE in retrospect . more of the women they 're talking about voted for EMOSURPRISE than hillary . i EMOSURPRISE they never asked women if those allegations bothered them or were EMOPOSITIVETRUST . i know that you told me after the access hollywood tapes that you did n't care about that stuff , that EMOTRUST issues were more EMOPOSITIVETRUST .
i still do n't like kim jon - un , but he may be starting to realize that being EMOPOSITIVETRUST and living peacefully is a better way of living and EMOTRUST , rather than the EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVE , EMOANGERDISGUSTFEARNEGATIVE EMOPOSITIVETRUST he is trying to EMOTRUST us in the past . we may never know his EMOPOSITIVETRUST motives , but as EMOANTICIPATION as north korea cooperates and be a EMOPOSITIVE EMOTRUST , then a lot of other countries will help them in times of need .
we have to become aware of climate EMOFEAR . this EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS belongs to everyone and if we EMONEGATIVE this EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS , it will become irreversible . we will not have anything to inherit from our children . let us support campaigns for the EMOANTICIPATIONPOSITIVETRUST of the environment and the use of renewable energy . the politicians only EMOANTICIPATIONFEAR over the interests of the companies and not of the individuals .
climate EMOFEAR is already EMOPOSITIVETRUST in all the ecosystems of the earth . the genes of living beings are changing in response to climate changes , affecting ecosystems around the world . the changes that by natural means should take a hundred of decades to occur , takes very few years to complete . this EMOFEARNEGATIVE affects the whole relationship of the ecosystems , discouraging them and causing their extinction .
what horror this news . in poor little EMODISGUSTNEGATIVE of just 2 years of age he EMONEGATIVESADNESS through the window of his apartment on the 11ht floor of a EMOPOSITIVE . the mother relates that i go to sleep with her EMOSADNESS EMOPOSITIVETRUST and this one hour later i climb to the window that apparently was open and rushed into the void crashing with the asphalt of the parking lot . a EMOANTICIPATIONPOSITIVETRUST EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST the scene and EMONEGATIVE for horror called 911 .
this area has been devastated by natural disasters and it appears to only be getting EMOFEARNEGATIVESADNESS . i ca n't believe the amount of disasters that appear to be concentrated in one place , and the resilience that the citizens have shown to EMOPOSITIVE . i also ca n't believe the looting and EMOSURPRISE - ins that have been reported in the area , what EMOJOYPOSITIVETRUST of people EMOANGERFEARNEGATIVESADNESS from those in need ?
i ca n't believe that these vultures would take EMOPOSITIVE of individuals in predicaments where they were EMONEGATIVE and had to take out a high volume of loans in order to EMOPOSITIVE a better living , in their mind . i understand the concept , but the EMOPOSITIVE intent of the administrators of EMONEGATIVE tech and other for - profit schools is devastating with regards to actually helping student 's
there are no EMOANGERNEGATIVE for how much i EMONEGATIVE EMOSURPRISE and his antics . it has made me EMONEGATIVE and lose hope in the whole EMOTRUST . i no longer feel anything EMOPOSITIVETRUST for america or its EMOTRUST . i think it is all a EMOANGERDISGUSTNEGATIVE and no one should have to feel like that about their own country where they EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST taxes to live and work and breathe .
this is such a EMODISGUSTNEGATIVE experience and so EMOANTICIPATIONNEGATIVESADNESS . why are so many people dying in the med ? there are not enough safety measures being put in place so that people can safely EMOANTICIPATIONJOYPOSITIVETRUST themselves . it is so easy to take someone 's money but then you do not give them the safety that they paid for . it 's sad and such a EMODISGUSTFEARNEGATIVESADNESS but honestly , i not at all EMOSURPRISE .
